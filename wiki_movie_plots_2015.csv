Title,Plot
The Forest,"The majority of the story is set in and around the Aokigahara Forest, a forest at the northwest base of Mount Fuji in Japan known as a popular destination for suicide.
Sara Price, an American woman, receives a phone call from the Japanese police telling her that they think her troubled twin sister Jess is dead, as she was seen going into Aokigahara forest. Despite the concerns of her fiancé, Rob, she journeys to Japan and arrives at the hotel where her sister was staying.
At her hotel, Sara meets a reporter named Aiden. They drink together, and she tells him of her parents' death. In reality, her father killed her mother, then committed suicide, but she tells him they were killed by a drunk driver. Her sister saw the bodies, but she didn't look. Aiden invites her to go into the forest with him and a park guide, Michi, so she can look for her sister.
As the three enter Aokigahara, Michi tells Sara that Jess has most likely killed herself. Sara refuses to believe this, explaining how, being a twin, she can ""feel"" that Jess is still alive. Deep in the woods, the group discovers a yellow tent that Sara recognizes as Jess's. With nightfall approaching, Michi suggests they leave a note for Jess and leave. Sara refuses, and Aiden volunteers to stay with her through the night.
That night, Sara hears rustling in the bushes and, believing it may be Jess, rushes into the woods after her. Sara finds a Japanese girl, Hoshiko, who claims to know Jess. The girl warns Sara not to trust Aiden and flees at the sound of his voice. Sara attempts to chase after her but falls and loses her.
The next day, Aiden and Sara become lost and begin to walk around the forest. As they walk, Sara's suspicions are raised and she demands Aiden to give her his phone and finds a picture of Jess on it. Aiden denies any involvement with Jess, but Sara runs into the forest alone. While running she begins to hear voices telling her to turn around. She appears to be unfazed by this until she hears the voice directly behind her. She turns around to see a hanging body and continues to run away. She then falls through a hole into an underground cave and goes unconscious, later she wakes up and discovers that she is in the cave with Hoshiko, who turns out to be a yūrei. Hoshiko then turns into what appears to be a ""demonic figure"". Sara then runs back towards the cave's opening, where Aiden finds her and helps her out of the cave. After some convincing, they continue to walk together.
Aiden brings Sara to an old ranger station he claims he'd discovered while looking for her. Sara hears her sister's voice coming from a locked basement, and finds a note which implies that Aiden is holding Jess captive in the basement. Convinced that he is a threat, Sara attacks and kills Aiden with a small kitchen knife. As he dies, Sara realizes that Aiden was telling the truth and that the picture on his phone, the voice at the basement door and the note had all been hallucinations.
In the basement of the ranger station, Sara sees a vision of the night her parents died. The ghost of her father suddenly appears and lunges toward her, grabbing her wrist. She cuts his fingers away from her wrist and escapes the station. Running into the forest, she sees Jess running toward the lights of the search party. Sara calls to her sister, who is unable to hear her. She realizes that her escape from the ranger station was another hallucination. When she cut at her father's fingers she was actually cutting deep into her own wrists, and is now dying from blood loss in the basement. As she succumbs to her wounds, hands of a group of yūrei pull Sara into the forest floor. Her very much alive sister is rescued by the search party and explains that the ""feeling"" of her sister is gone and it is assumed that Jess knows Sara is dead. As the search party leaves, Michi is seen staring at a figure and realizes that it's Sara's spirit."
Anesthesia,"Philosophy professor Walter Zarrow is wounded during a mugging. In an effort to escape he rings buzzers indiscriminately, waking Sam, a middle-aged father of two having an affair in the city. Sam reluctantly answers Zarrow's pleas, and Zarrow loses consciousness in his arms. Through an exploration of why these men, along with the mugger, and an addict named Joe, come together, we explore New York City. The experience of Zarrow, Sam, Joe and Zarrow's assailant ripple quickly out to include the connected lives of a housewife struggling with alcoholism, a stoner teen desperate to lose his virginity, a brilliant but failed writer fighting addiction, two parents confronting the prospect of terminal illness, and a brilliant grad student who harms herself to feel alive."

Linny tells David she's going to get mattresses from the other room; David lies, since Tommie is hiding in that room, by telling her a fake ghost story about ""Emily"". Tommie is seen running from the cabin, to Foster's house. She approaches the cabin and sees David and Linny having sex. David notices that Tommie is watching. David tells Tommie they are going to head back home. Once they arrive at their hometown, the two emotionally say goodbye.
The film ends with Tommie chasing after David as he drives away."
Ride Along 2,"The film starts in Miami on the boat of crime lord Antonio Pope. His hacker A.J. is going through a list on the computer. Pope calls Port Commissioner Griffin on the phone and accuses him of stealing money from him. With one of his hitmen in the room, Pope has Griffin killed in his apartment, then orders his hitmen to find whoever left with his money.
Meanwhile in Atlanta, James is with his partner Detective Mayfield as they go to infiltrate a vehicle meet to find an infamous drug dealer named Troy. Ben, fresh out the academy, is eager to get in on the action, but James has him staying on the radio. James gets close enough to Troy, but Troy pulls a gun on him. Ben sees this over the camera and sneaks out to help. He rides into the meet in a showy car with hydraulics and draws unwanted attention to himself. He threatens Troy by acting tough dancing only to drop his badge in front of the crook. Then within seconds a brief shootout occurs leading to a random plan ""B"" with Mayfield getting shot and Troy making his escape. James and Ben go after him, with Ben nearly getting himself run over, though James follows Troy long enough until Troy drives out of a parking garage and onto another car. James then captures Troy and removes a necklace he was wearing which was also a flash drive.
Mayfield is later hospitalized, and at the hospital, James reprimands Ben for his decision since he got Mayfield injured in the chaos causing him to take a leave of absence due to his injury. Lt. Brooks assigns James to go to Miami and see who Troy was working for. Ben wants to go so that he can prove himself ready for detective work, but nobody believes in him, especially after the mess he just caused.
At home, Ben begins to plan his wedding to Angela, but he clashes with the wedding planner Cori. He tries to assert himself, but gets knocked out by the ceiling fan. Later, as Angela tries to seduce Ben, he complains about not being able to go to Miami. Angela calls James and tries to get him to take Ben, not just for himself, but so she can have him out of her hair while the wedding is planned. James refuses, but then changes his mind when he thinks he can prove that Ben doesn't have what it takes to be a detective. He goes to their house and officially invites Ben to Miami. James and Ben drive down to Miami together.
Ben starts his detective work by trying to blend in with the locals as they search for A.J. but Ben gets punished by homicide detective Maya Cruz for using her computer without permission. Later, James and Ben find the hacker, who tells them about a safe in a club that contains something important, but first they have to meet with someone there. The guys go to the club for work, but A.J. gets Ben to enjoy himself with an impromptu bachelor party. However, the man they are supposed to meet is also Pope's hitman. A.J. causes a distraction and escapes while James engages in a brief shoot-out with the hitman. Afterward, the two are met by Maya at the crime scene. The safe turned out to be empty. Before the guys can leave, James realizes a bomb was planted under his car, which goes off and destroys his car.
Ben realizes he kept A.J.'s phone on him, so they find his girlfriend Tasha to get a lead on his whereabouts. Ben convinces Tasha to spill the beans when he shows her that he's been hooking up with other women and given them unique ringtones, while Tasha is left with the generic Apple ringtone. The guys locate A.J. once more and bring him in on the investigation. He reveals to the team that Pope is the real crook, despite him having a public image as an entrepreneur working alongside the new port commissioner Nunez. The team is at the home of Maya's friend/associate Alonso, whom Ben accidentally shoots after getting scared. Despite getting shot, Alonso backs up A.J.'s word that Pope is a crook.
James, Ben, and Maya go to a party hosted by Pope in his mansion. Maya distracts Pope by dancing with him while James and Ben gather info, and A.J. is their eyes and ears. While snooping around, Ben is attacked by Pope's pet alligator, Marcus, in the backyard. After narrowly escaping from the jaws of Pope's pet alligator, Ben reconnects with the team and they get their information, but Pope catches them and knows they're cops, though he lets them go. The team uses their information to locate a group of shipping trucks that may be carrying Pope's contraband. However, when they attempt to stop the trucks at the port, they discover that the trucks are empty. Hernandez Arturo del Puerto scolds the team, as Pope shows up and acts angry for what the team did. Nunez then shows up and calls Hernandez over. Brooks is informed of the screw-up and orders James to be suspended and for Ben to be fired.
The team goes to a bar to think about what they did wrong. Maya then questions as to why Nunez would have shown up so fast at the port. A.J. mentions that Nunez's name was on a list of guys on Pope's payroll. James realizes that Pope knew he would have gotten caught, so he had a decoy in the trucks, and the real contraband items are being brought in somewhere else at the port. James, Maya, and A.J. go after Pope, but Maya handcuffs Ben to a pole after James says he wants Ben to stay so he can take care of Angela. However, Ben breaks free and goes to Alonso's house to get the cuffs off.
James, Maya, and A.J. are at the port in the morning to catch Pope. They have a shootout with Pope and his goons, when Ben arrives and moves a truck to knock over a container with flammable barrels, causing them to explode. Pope runs and takes A.J. hostage, then tries fleeing in a truck. James goes after him, but Ben knocks a container into Pope's path, causing him to crash. James runs to the truck and doesn't find Pope. Pope tries to shoot James, but Ben jumps in the way and takes the bullet. James shoots Pope a few times to bring him down, then sees that Ben was wearing a bulletproof vest. Pope rises and shoots again, but James uses Ben as a human shield, and Maya shoots Pope once more for good measure, killing him and ending the gun battle once and for all.
James and Ben are off the hook for taking down Pope and Nunez and being commended for their services. They drive home in a yellow Lamborghini that Maya got for them to drive back to Atlanta for the wedding, with James asking Maya to be his date. Ben and Angela are married and are ready to go off on a boat ride, but Ben wants James to make a speech. Reluctantly, James speaks and says that while Ben has gotten him into a lot of trouble since meeting him, he has also saved his life, has made Angela very happy, and has helped James grow into a better man and cop. He finally accepts Ben as his new family. Ben and Angela then go on their boat ride, but Ben gets distracted and is thrown out the boat when he rides over a bump. He is then dragged through the water by a rope as Angela tries to stop the boat, all while James laughs at this."
13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,"In 2012, Benghazi, Libya is named one of the most dangerous places in the world, and countries have pulled their diplomatic offices out of the country in fear of an attack by militants. The United States, however, still has a diplomatic compound (not an official consulate) open in the city. Less than a mile away is a CIA outpost called ""The Annex"", which is protected by a team of private military contractors from Global Response Staff (GRS). New to the detail is Jack Silva, who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods, commander of the GRS team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex, Silva is introduced to the rest of the GRS team and the CIA Chief of Station, who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.
The U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections amidst the political and social chaos. Despite warnings, Stevens decides to stay at the Special Mission with limited protection from a pair of Diplomatic Security (DS) agents, Scott Wickland and Dave Ubben, and guards hired from the local February 17th Martyrs Brigade militia, nicknamed ""17-Feb"". On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex, Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.
That night, a group of militants from Ansar al-Sharia assault the compound. The 17-Feb guards quickly surrender their posts, allowing the attackers easy access to the Special Mission compound. Wickland takes Stevens and Smith, an IT specialist, into the safe room. Unable to breach the safe room, the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out. Wickland is able to escape but loses both Stevens and Smith. At the Annex, the GRS team desperately wants to go to the compound to help, but the Chief refuses, fearing that the team's departure would expose the Annex. However, the team dispatches to the compound and meets up with the DS agents. Silva and Woods go into the building to try to find Stevens and Smith, but are only able to find Smith's body. The DS team from the compound retreats to the Annex; but after Wickland goes in the wrong direction, they are followed back to the Annex. Later, the GRS team also retreats to the Annex.
Knowing an attack by the militants is imminent, the CIA staff of the Annex makes several desperate calls for help. The only help they can get is from Glen ""Bud"" Doherty, a GRS officer in Tripoli, who forms a team including two Delta operators that fly to Benghazi after several delays. Meanwhile, the GRS team fends off the militants as they try to breach the Annex perimeter. After repelling the largest attack wave, the Annex receives word from ISR that help is en route.
The Tripoli GRS reinforcements arrive and begin preparing the CIA and DS staff to depart for the airport. The militants launch a mortar attack in which Ubben and Geist are wounded; Geist's left arm is partially severed. Woods rushes to aid Geist and is killed by another mortar round. Doherty is also killed when a third mortar detonates directly in front of him.
With the GRS team compromised, and the Annex now vulnerable, the remaining GRS operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the Annex. Fearing the worst, the operators prepare to make a final stand, until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the Libya Shield Force militia escorting the GRS reinforcements. They also find out that Stevens was found behind the compound, but was pronounced dead at the hospital.
At the airport, the CIA staff and the wounded Geist board the plane to Tripoli while the remainder of the GRS team waits for the next plane with the bodies of Stevens, Smith, Woods and Doherty. Closing titles reveal that all of the surviving members of the Annex security team received contractor medals in a private ceremony and have since retired from the GRS team and live with their families (Geist was able to save his arm after several surgeries)."
Norm of the North,"Norm the polar bear is the son of the king of the Arctic. In his youth, he develops the ability to speak to humans, a trait shared by his grandfather.

Years later, Norm's grandfather has disappeared and human tourists are filling the Arctic. Socrates shows Norm and three Arctic lemmings a luxury condo that has been installed on the ice.

Greene decides to hire Norm as his mascot.
Before going on a television show, Norm meets Vera's daughter Olympia, who tells Norm to raise Greene's approval ratings and then speak out against him to save the Arctic. Norm's popularity heightens the approval ratings, but Greene sabotages Norm's plan by playing recorded dialogue stating that Norm supports Greene's developments.
Defeated, Norm is comforted by Vera and Olympia, who reveals that Greene is developing more homes to install in the Arctic. Norm and the lemmings discover that Greene is bribing a high-ranking member of the Polar Council, and exposes this to Pablo, one of Greene's investors. Vera resigns her position and is hired by Pablo, while Norm and the lemmings chase the truck holding the houses.
Greene sends another truck carrying Norm's grandfather, and Norm is captured as well. After being freed by the lemmings, Norm and his grandfather catch up to the boat carrying the houses to the Arctic, and are able to detach the houses. However, Norm is separated from his grandfather and the lemmings, and is knocked unconscious.
Norm awakens in the Arctic and reunited with the lemmings and the other animals, who reveal that his grandfather was not found.

The 5th Wave,"Ohio high-schooler Cassie Sullivan, armed with an M4 carbine, emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned gas station. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him. He was holding a Christian cross and the screen cuts to black to show her backstory.
A city-sized alien spaceship is circling Earth, containing extraterrestrials referred to as ""The Others"". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an electromagnetic pulse that permanently destroys all electrical power. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate the planet's geology and fault lines, causing earthquakes and megatsunamis that destroy coastal cities and islands. For the 3rd Wave, The Others weaponize a strain of avian flu virus, with birds carrying the infectant across the planet. Cassie's mother is one of the casualties.
Cassie, her father and her younger brother Sam, find a refugee camp in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The unit's commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the army massacring all the adults, her father included.
Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.
At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squad's scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind.
Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base. Ben's squad is reunited and Cassie ponders the strength of hope as humanity's driving force for survival."
The Boy,"Greta Evans, a young American from Montana, is hired as a nanny by the Heelshires. Upon arriving in their small town in the United Kingdom, the elderly couple show Greta her charge: a porcelain doll named Brahms that they treat like their son. Over the next day, the couple coach Greta on taking care of Brahms and their house, leave her a list of rules to follow, then leave for a holiday.
Initially, Greta ignores the rules and the doll and follows her own routine. She regularly calls her sister Sandy, who tells her that her abusive ex-boyfriend Cole has been trying to find out where she is.
Malcolm, the local grocery dealer, stops by to deliver groceries, and Greta learns that the real Brahms was killed in a fire 20 years ago on his eighth birthday. Greta accepts Malcolm's offer to show her the town, and prepares for the date. However, her dress and jewelry vanish and she is lured to the attic by strange noises and locked in.
She is mysteriously let out the next morning. She explains to Malcolm what happened, and they briefly discuss the real Brahms.
Strange things begin to happen—a child's sobs are heard in the hallways, phone calls are cut off, and the doll seems to move on its own, vanishing and reappearing elsewhere in the house. After receiving a phone call in which a child's voice urges her to follow the rules, Greta locks herself in her room. She later finds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich outside her door.
Elsewhere, the Heelshires write a goodbye letter to Brahms, then drown themselves.
Believing that Brahms' spirit lives within the doll, Greta begins to take the rules more seriously. After Greta demonstrates the doll's ability to move by itself, Malcolm becomes worried. He informs Greta that the real Brahms was friends with a young girl about his age. One day, she was found in the forest with her skull crushed. Before the police could question Brahms, the Heelshires' house was burned down with him in it. Malcolm warns Greta not to stay in the house, but Greta, having previously suffered a miscarriage after she was beaten by Cole, feels obligated to care for Brahms.
One evening, Cole abruptly appears in the house and announces his intention to bring Greta back home, by force if necessary. Malcolm makes an early delivery and decides to stay nearby. As she puts Brahms to sleep, Greta asks Brahms for help. Cole wakes up and sees a message written in blood urging him to leave. Believing it was done by either Greta or Malcolm, Cole angrily snatches the doll from Greta and smashes it.
The house begins to shake and the lights start flickering. Cole hears noises behind a mirror and investigates. The mirror explodes and knocks Cole to the ground. A strange voice calls Greta's name from the hole behind the mirror and a grown man wearing a porcelain mask of Brahms emerges. It is revealed to be the real Brahms who apparently survived the fire and now has been living in the passages behind the walls of the house. Brahms attacks and kills Cole, then turns on Malcolm and Greta.
A chase ensues throughout the house. Greta and Malcolm discover Brahms' room while trying to find an exit. A doll made from Greta's missing dress, hair and jewelry is in Brahms' bed. Greta finds the final letter from the Heelshires revealing their plan of leaving Greta as a mate for Brahms. Brahms catches them and severely beats Malcolm, threatening to kill him if Greta leaves.
Greta flees anyway, but has a change of heart. Arming herself with a screwdriver, Greta invokes the rules to force Brahms to go to bed. He asks for a good night kiss, and when she complies Brahms sexually assaults her. Greta stabs him, but he throws her across the room and tries to choke her. She stabs him several more times and he collapses. Greta drags Malcolm to his car and sighs with relief as they leave the estate.
Later, Brahms, who has survived, is seen repairing the shattered doll."
Ip Man 3,"In 1959, Ip Man is settling into his low-profile life in Hong Kong. His elder son, Ip Chun, has returned to Foshan to study, leaving him with his younger son Ip Ching and his wife Cheung Wing-sing in Hong Kong. A young Bruce Lee visits Ip and asks to become one of his students, saying he would be his greatest disciple. After Lee demonstrates his speed, Ip neither accepts nor rejects him, but insinuates for him to leave by opening the door.
After Ip Ching gets into a fight with his schoolmate, Cheung Fung, their teacher, Miss Wong, asks the parents to come to the school, though only the Ips arrive. As an apology, the Ip family invite Cheung Fung to their home for dinner. At Ip's house, Cheung Fung displays rudimentary yet impressive Wing Chun skills. When Ip asks the boy who his mentor is, he says that it is his father, Cheung Tin-chi, a poor rickshaw puller who shows up to pick up his son shortly after. Although he interacts cordially with Ip Man, he secretly envies Ip's wealth and popularity and seeks to surpass him, participating successfully in underground fights to earn extra money.
The organiser, Ma King-sang, a local triad leader, also works for Frank, an American property developer and highly proficient boxer. Frank orders Ma to acquire a piece of land occupied by the school where Ip Ching and Cheung Fung study. Ma asks for a month for it to be done, but is threatened into assuring that it will be done within two weeks. The next day, when Ip goes to pick up his son from school, he witnesses Ma and his men coercing and beating the headmaster, who refuses to sell them the school. Ip interferes and restrains Ma, but is forced to let him go. Ip seeks help from Sergeant ""Fat Po"", a close friend of his and a local police detective. Fat Po agrees to help Ip, but claims a shortage of manpower and influence. Ip then decides to guard the school alongside his students.
That night, they fend off an attack by Ma's men, who attempt to set fire to the school and kidnap the headmaster. Cheung, who happens to pass by, helps fight off the invaders and rescues the headmaster. Cheung's skills impress Ip, and he thanks Cheung for his help. Tin Ngo-san, a local martial arts master and Ma's former mentor, is enraged by Ma's unscrupulous acts, and accompanied by Ip, confronts Ma at the Hong Kong shipyard where he humiliates him in front of his men. Ma retaliates with a hidden knife, but Ip is able to stop him. Fat Po arrives and keeps the situation at bay, but Ip eventually lets Ma go again to de-escalate the situation. Ma finds Cheung and offers him a large sum of money to get revenge against Tin on his behalf. Desperate to open his own martial arts school, Cheung accepts the offer and is able to put Tin in the hospital. Ip receives a call from the hospital and visits Tin.
Upon learning that Tin did not call him, Ip realises that it was a set-up by Ma to lure him away from the school, so that his gang could kidnap some of the students, including Ip Ching and Cheung Fung. Ip arrives alone at Ma's shipyard, where Ma holds Ip Ching at knife point and threatens to sell the children into slavery if the headmaster refuses to surrender the school. Upon learning that his son was also kidnapped, Cheung arrives and is allowed to leave with his son due to being an associate; but after his son tells him that they still have his friends, he returns and fights alongside Ip. Ip and Cheung are able to hold their own until a troop of policemen led by Fat Po comes to arrest the gang, while Ma flees. After the incident, Frank dismisses Ma and sends a Thai boxer to go after Ip instead.
Returning home, Ip learns that Wing-sing has been diagnosed with cancer and may only live another six months. While taking Wing-sing home from a medicine shop, Ip is attacked in an elevator by the Thai boxer, who is defeated before the elevator reaches the ground floor. Fat Po later tells Ip about Frank, who wants to eliminate Ip at all costs for obstructing his plans. Ip decides to confront Frank in his office, where he engages Ip in a three-minute fight, promising to leave him alone if he can just last the three minutes. Ip is initially overwhelmed by his opponent's sheer muscle and force but begins turning the tide when he attacks Frank's lower half and they fight to a draw after the three minutes pass. Ip leaves the office and Frank keeps his promise, seemingly impressed.
Cheung, with the money he obtained from Ma earlier, opens his martial arts school, and claims that his Wing Chun is genuine while Ip's is not. Cheung proceeds to build his reputation by defeating a number of martial arts masters. Finally, he challenges Ip to a battle that will decide who is the true Grandmaster of Wing Chun. Meanwhile, Ip spends more time with his ailing wife, ashamedly feeling that he had neglected her earlier. On the day of the match, Ip chooses not to attend, but instead goes out dancing with Wing-sing, instructed by Bruce Lee, whom Ip finally accepts as a student. Owing to Ip's failure to attend, Cheung is declared the winner, although he seems unsatisfied by Ip's refusal to fight him. Wing-sing, despite being happy about Ip's decision to accompany her, makes an appointment with Cheung for another match on Ip's behalf, as she guesses that Ip would have attended if not for her condition.
Wing-sing accompanies Ip to the fight. After a battle with six and a half point poles, butterfly swords and an empty-handed fight, Ip eventually overpowers Cheung with a one-inch punch. Accepting defeat, Cheung destroys the banner that proclaimed himself to be the Grandmaster. Ip tells him that their closest ones are more important than competing and leaves. In the epilogue, it is revealed that Wing-sing died in 1960, and that Ip helped make Wing Chun well known internationally and left a legacy."
Synchronicity,"Physicist Jim Beale, working with two colleagues (Chuck and Matt), invents a machine that makes time travel possible. The machine operates by creating one half of a wormhole during one run, the other half during a second run. In addition, the process is expensive and dangerous. To activate the process requires radioactive material created by KMC, a company owned by Klaus Meisner, a venture capitalist.
If the material is mishandled as part of the process, the machine will malfunction - creating a devastating explosion. During the first test, Beale receives a genetically-created Dahlia flower from the wormhole. Beale cannot prove his invention actually works without Meisner's material for a second test. Meisner demands 50% ownership of the process in exchange for the material, but he gets 49%. The second test is scheduled for one week after the first.
Soon after the first test, Beale meets Abby Ross, who seems to know too much about him for their meeting to be coincidental. He is attracted to her, but also suspicious. His suspicions are apparently confirmed when Chuck calls him on his cell phone and tells Beale that Abby is not to be trusted and the test has succeeded much more than they thought. Beale leaves Abby and rushes back to the lab, but Chuck refuses to explain. Beale later ignores his suspicions and starts a relationship with Abby. They discover a deep bond, which is broken when Chuck's warning is confirmed: Abby tells Meisner about the flower. Meisner threatens Beale with knowledge of the flower, the intellectual property of another of his companies. Meisner extorts Beale for another 50% ownership of Beale's research, leaving Beale with 1%.
Heartbroken and not thinking clearly, during the second test Beale jumps into the wormhole and is transported one week into the past to the time of the first test.
Beale is convinced that on this ""second run"", he can outwit Meisner and Abby and prevent his research from falling into their hands. He seduces Abby but soon learns that she was honestly attracted to him: a science writer herself, she had read an article about him and crafted a fanciful story in a journal about what he must be like. Having learned more about him from Meisner and from learning about his work, she is powerfully attracted to him. Beale reads the fictional story but finds that it is both a somewhat inaccurate representation of his work and is unfinished.
Complications arise: the ""second run"" Beale becomes physically weakened, and experiences pain when in close proximity to ""Jim Prime"", the Beale from before jumping into the wormhole. Beale reveals himself to Chuck and Matt in the hopes of securing their help to protect the research. They both assist Beale and conceal his presence from Jim Prime, explaining several confusing interactions in the week before the second test. Beale is jealous of Jim Prime, but there is no need: Jim Prime is still suspicious of Abby and it is clear that he will have nothing to do with her after the second test because of her betrayal.
Beale continues to weaken. He encounters Abby's journal again (this time in Matt's hands) and is confused - in the first timeline, it was at Abby's apartment. Matt says he found it in Jim's coat pocket when he came out of the wormhole. The journal is now subtly different and it makes it clear that Beale has jumped not back in time, but into the past of a parallel universe, slightly different from the one he left. Slight inconsistencies Beale has not noticed in this timeline are explained. Chuck says that it is impossible for two Beales to exist in the same universe, so the ""second run"" Beale will die and only Jim Prime will remain.
Beale enlists Chuck and Matt's help in making an unscheduled wormhole to send himself to the past with his new knowledge to try and prevent the research from being stolen. A mistake is made in the process, preventing the time jump and wasting the radioactive material.
The date of the second test arrives. Beale finds another time-displaced Jim dead in a hotel after trying to leave the city. He returns to the Grand Hotel, where he sees Abby's apparent betrayal was to get more material to make the second test happen to send Jim Prime away and save Beale's life. The second test happens as before, but when Abby returns to the Grand Hotel, Beale has already died.
After, Abby is alone in a cafe when Jim Prime - apparently healthy - sits down across from her. Jim reveals a deep attraction to Abby, and introduces himself. Abby acknowledges his similarity in appearance to the physicist ""John Bain"" whom she is writing a novel about. However, as far as she knew, John Bain was killed in a devastating explosion in his lab. The unspoken implication is that Jim Prime would not wither away like Beale did, as he entered a universe with no other Jim present."
Kung Fu Panda 3,"In the spirit realm, Oogway fights against an adversary named Kai, who has defeated other kung fu masters in the realm and taken their chi. Oogway willingly gives in and also has his chi stolen, but not before warning Kai that the Dragon Warrior, Po, will stop him. Kai takes this as a challenge to steal the Dragon Warrior's chi and returns to the mortal realm.
Meanwhile, Master Shifu announces his retirement from teaching and passes the role of teacher to Po. An initially excited Po realizes that teaching kung fu is not as easy as he thought, and the Furious Five are injured as a result. Po is demoralized because of his failure, but Shifu advises Po that instead of trying to be a teacher, he should try to be himself. Po returns home where he meets a panda, Li Shan, whom they both realize is his long-lost biological father. They quickly bond with each other, much to the jealousy of Po's adoptive father, Mr. Ping.
After introducing Li to Shifu and his friends, Po and the Five defend the Valley of Peace from jade zombies that Kai has created from the chi of past kung fu masters. The team learns through research that in order to defeat Kai, Po must learn to master the use of chi himself, an ability utilized by ancient pandas. Li offers to teach him by taking him to his secret panda village home. Po and Li travel to the village while Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to deal with Kai; Mr. Ping follows the pandas, worried that he will lose Po's affections to Li. Although Po is eager to learn chi, Li tells him he must first learn the relaxed life of a panda in the village.
Kai takes the chi of nearly every kung fu master in China, including Shifu and the Furious Five except Tigress, who warns the pandas of Kai's intention to steal their chi. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po demands that Li teach him how to use chi, Li confesses that he does not know how, and that he lied out of fear of losing his son again. Po is hurt over his father's misdirection and isolates himself to train vigorously to fight Kai; Mr. Ping, who realizes Po has become happier with Li being a part of his life, encourages Li and the other pandas to stay and ask Po to train them so they can fight back. Tigress confronts Po and tells him that he has no other way of defeating Kai. Po then laments that he will never win when Li, Mr. Ping and all the Pandas come and ask Po to train them to be his army. Realizing what had previously made him fail as a teacher, Po agrees and teaches them using their everyday activities as their assets.
Kai arrives and sends his jade zombie minions to capture Po, who sends the pandas, Ping, and Tigress upon them, distracting Kai. The plan works in holding off the army, but when Po tries to use his signature Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai to send him back to the spirit realm, Kai reveals that it can only work on mortals, not a spirit warrior like himself. Kai gains the upper hand in their fight, but Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold again on himself while gripping Kai, transporting them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, with Kai regaining the advantage to subdue Po. Using what they learned from Po, Li, Tigress, Mr. Ping, and the pandas are able to use their chi to revive and empower him. Po harnesses their chi to create a giant dragon figure which he uses to overload Kai, causing him to explode, defeating him and restoring all of the fallen masters to normal.
In an ethereal golden pond, Oogway appears to Po and informs him that his journey as the Dragon Warrior has come full circle, declaring Po to be his true successor. By choice, Po wields a mystic jade yin-yang staff bestowed by Oogway to return to the mortal world. He and his extended family all return to the valley, where they continue practicing kung fu and their chi."
The Finest Hours,"Bernard ""Bernie"" Webber, a crewman at the Coast Guard station in Chatham, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, has fallen in love with a local girl, Miriam Pentinen. The two plan to marry on April 16, but in accordance with Coast Guard regulations, Bernie must seek permission from the station's commander, Daniel Cluff. On the day he is due to ask permission, the oil tanker SS Pendleton shears in half off the Chatham coast after getting caught in a nor'easter. With the majority of the station's crew already underway with the rescue of the similarly damaged SS Fort Mercer, Bernie is dispatched to pilot motor lifeboat CG 36500 to rescue the crew of Pendleton. Andrew Fitzgerald, Ervin Maske, and Richard P. Livesey volunteer to join Bernie on the rescue mission.
Meanwhile, the Pendleton's engineer, Ray Sybert, as the surviving senior officer, organizes the surviving seamen to steer the sinking stern of the tanker onto a submerged reef, where it can lodge until rescuers arrive.
When Miriam hears that Bernie is leading the rescue effort, she, like a number of townspeople, thinks this is a suicide mission. Few people in Chatham trust Cluff, since he is not from the area and does not know its treacherous weather. Miriam drives to the station, demanding that Cluff call Bernie back. Cluff refuses, and brusquely orders Miriam out.
Between the Chatham harbor and the open sea lies a bar, a series of shoals that are very dangerous even in good weather. Bernie must time bursts of his engine to ride each approaching wave before it breaks as he pilots CG 36500 across the bar. Although he makes it over the bar, he loses his compass.
Bernie steers CG 36500 to the stricken tanker. Although his boat's designated capacity is only 12 people, Bernie manages to rescue 32 crewmen. The stern of Pendleton begins sinking more rapidly during the rescue and goes down shortly after the last crewman comes aboard Bernie's boat. Relying on his knowledge of the coast and prevailing winds in place of his compass, Bernie steers CG 36500 toward home—a task made more difficult as Chatham loses power. Miriam and the other townspeople drive their cars to the pier and turn on their headlights to guide Bernie in.
The film shows photographs from the event that briefly document the aftermath of the rescue. Two months later, Bernie and Miriam marry; they stay together for 58 years until Bernie's death in 2009. Webber and his crew receive the Gold Lifesaving Medal."
Jane Got a Gun,"Jane and her husband Bill ""Ham"" Hammond live in an isolated house with their five-year-old daughter Katie. One day Ham returns home with several serious bullet wounds. As Jane is attending to his injuries, Ham tells her that ""the Bishop Boys are coming"". This is a gang of vicious criminals, led by John Bishop, that Ham himself used to ride with.
Realizing that she is going to need help in order to defend her home and family from the Bishops, as Ham's injuries have rendered him helpless, Jane takes her daughter to a place of safety, with a woman friend whom she trusts. She then rides to the home of a neighbor, Dan Frost, and asks him if he will help her to protect her property from the Bishop Boys. Dan, a somewhat surly man who lives in a squalid, dirty house, refuses to help. It is obvious from their brief conversation that there is some past history – and bitterness - between Dan and Jane.
Jane rides into town to buy guns and ammunition and hopefully find someone who will help her family. As she is leaving the gun shop, she is waylaid and dragged into an alley by one of the Bishop gang. He threatens her at gunpoint and – despite Jane protesting that she ""hasn't seen Hammond in years"" – he demands that she take him back to her house, as he is convinced that Ham is there, having recognized the gun Jane is carrying as one belonging to Hammond. However, at this point Dan Frost suddenly appears and tells the thug to leave Jane alone. While the two men are distracted, Jane draws her gun and kills the outlaw.
Leaving the body in the alley, Jane and Dan ride back to her house. Ham is still alive, but very weak. Dan has changed his mind about helping Jane, so they start preparing for the expected attack from the Bishop gang.
Meanwhile, Bishop has already set out with his gang to find Ham. His men spread out over the area to extend their search, and one of them chances upon Jane's house. He recognizes Jane, but Dan kills him before he can raise the alarm.
Dan digs a shallow trench in Jane's front yard, and they fill this with jars containing kerosene, nails and pieces of glass. As they work, we see flashbacks of their previous lives. Jane and Dan were once engaged, but he enlisted in the army to fight in the American Civil War. Captured by the enemy, he was held for years in a prison camp, and when he finally returned home, Jane had left. He travelled from state to state trying to find her, showing her photograph in every town. Eventually, he heard that she had moved west on a wagon train led by John Bishop. Dan talked to Bishop, who told him that during the journey Ham and Jane ran off together. He said he would gladly help Dan to track them down, as he had his own scores to settle with Ham, but Dan refused, saying that he preferred to ride alone.
Dan eventually found Jane, but by then she was married to Ham, and they had had a child. Dan realized that he had lost her forever and was left broken-hearted by the discovery.
Later, Jane tells Dan her side of the story. After Dan left to enlist, she discovered she was pregnant. When Dan did not return, or write, she assumed he was dead. By the time their child, a little girl called Mary, was two or three years old, life in Jane's war-torn town had become so wretched that she decided to take Mary and move West on the Bishop wagon train. Too late, she and the other women on the wagon train realized that Bishop's intention was to start a brothel in another town, and he intended to force the helpless women into prostitution.
A further flashback shows that Ham, having taken a fancy to Jane during the wagon train journey, tells Bishop that he would like to marry her. But Bishop tells Ham that Jane is his ""property"". Later, Ham finds that Jane and her daughter have gone missing; searching for Mary, he sees a child's boot in the river, and thinks the child has drowned. He goes to the brothel where Jane has been forced to work, and rescues her. Jane is distraught when Ham tells her that Mary is dead.
Back in the present time, the Bishop gang finally arrive at Jane's house, under cover of darkness. Dan and Jane fire into the booby-trapped ditch, igniting the kerosene ""bombs"". Most of the gang are killed, but some – including Bishop himself – escape. Jane and Dan manage to move the dying Ham into a shallow storage space beneath the floor, to protect him from the gunfire, but the strain is too much for him and he dies. Dan and Jane continue to fight it out with the remaining gang members, although both are wounded. Finally, Bishop (the only gang member left alive) manages to corner Dan and is about to kill him, when Jane sneaks up behind Bishop and draws her gun on him. Trying to persuade her not to kill him, Bishop tells Jane that Mary is not dead, as she had thought. Jane shoots him several times, wounding him badly, until in his agony he reveals that Mary lives at the brothel. Jane then kills Bishop.
Jane and Dan go to the brothel and find their daughter, Mary, who is working as a servant. Jane takes the bodies of John Bishop and his gang to the sheriff and collects a huge reward. Then she, Dan, Mary and Katie ride off together to start a new life as a family."
"Hail, Caesar!","In 1951, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) is the head of physical production at Capitol Pictures and also works as a ""fixer"" to keep the scandalous behavior of its stars out of the press. He often has to fend off inquiries from Thora and Thessaly Thacker (both played by Tilda Swinton), twin sisters and rival gossip columnists. The Lockheed Corporation has been courting him with an offer of a high-level executive position, but he is unsure about taking it. When unmarried synchronised swimming actress DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) becomes pregnant, Mannix arranges for her to put the baby in foster care, and then adopt it without revealing herself as the mother.
The studio's major production is Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ, an epic set in ancient Roman times and starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). During a shot, Whitlock drinks from a goblet of wine that was drugged by an extra (Wayne Knight); he passes out while rehearsing lines by himself behind the soundstage and is abducted. A ransom note soon arrives, written by a group calling itself ""The Future,"" demanding $100,000. Mannix arranges to get the money from the studio's Accounting Department, as ""petty cash.""
Whitlock awakens in a beach house and finds his way into a meeting of The Future, a Communist cell. The members, who introduce themselves as mostly writers in the motion picture industry, explain their doctrine to him and begin to win him over to their cause. At the same time, Thora threatens Mannix by stating she will release an article about a scandal involving the earlier film On Wings As Eagles, which gave Whitlock his break-out role. Mannix successfully negotiates for her to postpone the story by a day in exchange for information about the romantic life of singing Western film star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich).
Doyle is cast in a comedy of manners helmed by posh director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) in an attempt by the studio to broaden his appeal. After Doyle's initial performance is hopelessly incompetent, Laurentz visits Mannix and asks him to remove Doyle from the project so that Laurentz can preserve his artistic vision for the film. Mannix informs Laurentz that Doyle's role is non-negotiable and convinces him to coach the young actor to give a better performance. Doyle comes to Mannix's office and admits that he feels the part is too far outside his comfort zone. Mannix reassures him that he has the needed acting abilities and tells him about Whitlock's kidnapping.
That evening, Doyle attends the premiere of one of his own Westerns with starlet Carlotta Valdez (Verónica Osorio), per instructions from Mannix. Doyle is initially disappointed that his lone singing scene is depicted in a comedic manner, rather than as heartfelt as he intended. However, after seeing the audience react positively to the scene, Doyle warms to it himself. Doyle and Valdez visit a nightclub, where the pair are genuinely developing chemistry until they are interrupted by both Thacker sisters, each looking to get a scoop on their relationship. Doyle suddenly spots the briefcase containing the ransom money, recognizing it because he had lent Mannix his belt to keep it closed. It is being carried by Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), the star of a sailor musical comedy depicted earlier in an elaborate dancing scene.
Mannix and Moran meet with a surety agent, Joseph Silverman (Jonah Hill), an average man whom the studio has used to solve public problems; he has a solid reputation as completely dependable, reliable, and discreet. He will agree to provide foster care for Moran's child, preserving her image. Moran, who expressed frustration with her previous two marriages with a mobster and a Hollywood type, finds herself strongly attracted to Silverman.
Doyle follows Gurney to the beach house in Malibu but, after walking in the front door, finds only Whitlock inside. The rest of The Future's members have rowed a boat containing Gurney offshore so that he can rendezvous with a Soviet submarine and defect to Russia. The members of The Future give him the money for the Communist cause. As Gurney boards the submarine, his dog jumps into his arms, causing him to drop the briefcase, which sinks into the ocean. Doyle takes Whitlock back to the studio just before the police arrive at the beach house to arrest the group, after Mannix's investigation led him to the house.
Whitlock tries to explain his new-found Communist leanings to Mannix, who cuts him off sharply, slapping his face numerous times, and orders him to finish his role in Hail, Caesar!; the actor is chastened, but encouraged by a final directive from Mannix to be a movie star.
Mannix is notified the next morning that Moran married Silverman who will adopt the child with her. Mannix announces he has decided to reject the Lockheed offer and continue working at Capitol. Thora then meets with Mannix and informs him that the column she plans to publish about On Wings As Eagles will reveal that Whitlock got his major role in the film by having sex with Laurentz. However, Mannix has deduced that Gurney is her source for the piece and persuades her to not run the story since Gurney is a Communist who has defected—which would cause her own reputation to suffer by association. Mannix leaves the worried-looking Thora, secure in his station in life.
Set in 1951,[4] Hail, Caesar! takes place at a transitional time for the film industry. The studio system was breaking down, and a Supreme Court ruling had forced studios to divest their movie theaters. Television, then still in its early years, threatened to pull away audiences. The Cold War and the Red Scare were both underway. Hollywood responded by creating escapist fare: westerns, highly choreographed dance and aquatic spectacles, and, as the film title suggests, Roman epics with massive casts.[5]
Writing in The Washington Post, Kristen Page-Kirby noted that the nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age is heavily filtered by time. ""It’s easy to look back at any part of the past and say, 'Yeah, that’s how it should be today'. Hail, Caesar! uses the uniformly terrible fake movies within it to show that while we all remember 1946 for stuff like The Yearling and Notorious, it also gave us Tarzan and the Leopard Woman.""[6] The Coens cited their own examples of sub-par films and performances from the era that they saw as television re-runs while growing up: That Touch of Mink (1962), and Laurence Olivier, in mahogany makeup, co-starring with Charlton Heston in Khartoum (1966). ""We loved that stuff. We just didn’t realize we were watching crap"", said Joel Coen.[7]"
Pride + Prejudice + Zombies,"Early 19th century England is beset by zombies; the Bennet sisters—Elizabeth, Jane, Kitty, Lydia, and Mary—have all been trained in the art of weaponry and martial arts in China at their father's behest so they can defend themselves from the zombies. Mrs. Bennet only wants to see her daughters married off to wealthy suitors. The Bennets attend a country dance also attended by Colonel Darcy and Caroline and Charles Bingley. There, the young and handsome Bingley falls for Jane. Charles Bingley has inherited £100,000 (£6.0 million today)—attracting Mrs. Bennet's attention as a desirable suitor for her daughter. When zombies attack the ball, the Bennet sisters fight them off, and Colonel Darcy, a friend of Bingley's and skilled zombie-killer, who was conversely trained in Japanese martial arts – with property that pays him £10,000 annually (£600,000 today) – becomes smitten with Elizabeth. On the way to the Bingleys' later, Jane is attacked by a zombie and catches a fever. Darcy orders her confined in fear that she may have been bitten but she recovers.
The Bennets are visited by the overbearing Parson Collins, who proposes to Elizabeth but states that she must give up her life as a warrior, something she refuses to do. Elizabeth meets a charming soldier named Wickham and arranges to meet him at another ball. She travels with him to a church that is filled with zombies who feed on pig brains instead of human brains, keeping their behaviour relatively normal. Wickham believes that with these new civilised zombies, humans can co-exist with them. He asks Elizabeth to elope but she backs off. Elizabeth learns that Darcy convinced the Bingleys to leave to keep Bingley away from Jane. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, having fallen in love with her, she expresses outrage at his actions and fights him.
Darcy later writes Elizabeth a letter to apologize. He reiterates that he separated Jane and Bingley for fear that Jane only wanted to marry Bingley for his wealth – having overheard Mrs. Bennet drunkenly mention it. He also exposes Wickham's true nature, he and Wickham were childhood friends but Wickham may have murdered Darcy's father, squandered his inheritance, then tried to elicit additional money from Darcy's estate; when that failed, Wickham tried to elope with Darcy's little sister, for her fortune. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has taken Lydia and London has been overrun with zombies. Darcy saves Lydia and learns that Wickham is using the 'civilised' zombies to create a zombie army, which has overrun London based on Wickham's planning and will rule the country. He stops him by giving the zombies human brains, which turns them savage.
While fighting, Darcy stabs Wickham's chest, revealing him to have been undead all along, staying civilized by consuming pig brains. Elizabeth saves Darcy from being killed by Wickham. As the two ride across the bridge, the army destroys it to keep the zombies from crossing over from London. Darcy is injured in the explosion and Elizabeth tearfully admits her love for him. After Darcy recovers, he proposes to Elizabeth again and this time, she agrees. The two have a joint wedding with Bingley and Jane. In a mid-credits scene, Wickham leads a horde of zombies toward the wedding celebration with the Four Horsemen of the Zombie Apocalypse riding behind him."

After a storm nearly destroys their house, Travis finds the wind chimes that Gabby had on her porch. Travis goes to his island and builds a gazebo and hangs the wind chimes there. The shell chime starts to ring in the wind and Travis runs to the hospital where Gabby has woken up from her coma. He takes her home where she is welcomed by the family and Travis' sister's newborn child. To make up for missing their dinner date they have one in the front yard, where she tells him she heard everything he said whilst in the coma.

Deadpool,"Wade Wilson is a dishonorably discharged special forces operative working as a mercenary, when he meets escort Vanessa. They become romantically involved, and a year later she accepts his marriage proposal. However, after Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer, he leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die.
A mysterious recruiter approaches Wilson, offering an experimental cure for his cancer. He is taken to Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. When Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.
Wilson survives and seeks out Vanessa, but then does not reveal he is alive, afraid of how she would react to his new appearance. After consulting his best friend Weasel, Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name ""Deadpool"" (from Weasel picking him in a dead pool), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al. Deadpool questions and murders many of Ajax's men until one, the recruiter, reveals Ajax's whereabouts. Deadpool intercepts Ajax and a convoy of armed men on an expressway, killing everyone but Ajax. He demands the cure, but is interrupted by the X-Man Colossus and his trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Colossus wants Deadpool to mend his ways and join the X-Men. Taking advantage of the distraction, Ajax escapes. He goes to Weasel's bar and learns of Vanessa.
Ajax kidnaps her and takes her to a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him rescue Vanessa. While Colossus and Negasonic battle Angel and several soldiers, Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the falling ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again, but reveals that there is no cure after Deadpool overpowers him. Despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills Ajax, though he promises to try and be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry at Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him."
Zoolander 2,"At Fashion Interpol, Valentina Valencia examines the expressions of recently assassinated pop singers' last images and believes they match Derek Zoolander's trademark look, ""Blue Steel"". A flashback reveals that the Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good collapsed, killing Matilda Jeffries and injuring Hansel McDonald. Derek later lost custody of his son, Derek Zoolander Jr., and announced his retirement from modeling and subsequent reclusion.
Derek now lives alone in ""extreme northern"" New Jersey.

In the ""uncharted Malibu territories"", Hansel returns to his home after dinner and is informed by his orgy that they are all pregnant and that he is the father. He is later given the same invitation by Zane. After reuniting, Derek and Hansel are tracked down by Valentina, who asks them to help Interpol uncover who is behind the systematic assassinations.
At the fashion show, Derek and Hansel are surprised to find that the ever-changing fashion world is now dominated by the likes of Don Atari and the non-binary All.

However, Derek Jr. becomes disgruntled with his father and returns to the orphanage. Hansel receives an anonymous call, requesting that he travel to St. Peter's Basilica at midnight. He, Derek, and Valentina go to the church and meet with Sting, who tells them the tale of Adam and Eve and the little-known Steve, a secret that many rockstars have died to protect. It is said that Steve is the common ancestor of all models and that he and his closest descendant (Derek Jr) holds the bloodline of the Fountain of Youth.
Derek returns to the orphanage, only to find it in disrepair and his son and the Headmaster gone. He travels to Jacobim Mugatu's isolated prison, but Mugatu tricks him into trading places with him so he can escape. Mugatu leaves on a helicopter while Hansel stows away by hiding on top of the rotor. Derek and Valentina swim back to Rome while Hansel infiltrates the House of Atoz. He witnesses Mugatu reuniting with Alexanya and killing Don Atari. Hansel finds Derek Jr. imprisoned and reunites with Derek and Valentina at the IncrediBALL. They enter a bathhouse through a rear entrance and witness Derek Jr. strapped to a sacrificial table.
Mugatu and many of the world's fashion designers prepare to cut out Derek Jr.'s heart and consume his blood, believing it to grant them eternal youth as it contains the blood of Steve. Derek, Hansel, and Valentina stop Mugatu from proceeding and he reveals that he brought together the world's fashion designers to kill them as revenge for leaving him imprisoned. Alexanya, who is actually Katinka Ingaborgovinananananana, attacks Valentina, while Mugatu tells Derek that he was behind the destruction of his Center by hiring the construction crew to build a faulty base. He then throws an explosive towards the lava. Derek manages to stop it with ""Magnum"", but he struggles to keep it suspended in mid-air. Sting arrives and reveals that he is Hansel's father, and they, along with Derek Jr. releasing the look, ""El Niño"", successfully hurl the explosive back at Mugatu, killing him. Derek Jr. forgives his father for his mother's death and Derek and Valentina confess their love for each other. Matilda's ghost gives them her blessing and says that Mugatu live-streamed the event.
Six weeks later, Derek and Hansel have returned to modeling. Derek and Valentina have a daughter named Darlene, while Derek Jr. becomes the next model and now in a relationship with Malala Yousafzai. Hansel returns to living with his orgy and is now the father of 10 children."

Alice meets with Josh to tell him she is finished with their break and ready to get back together. Josh explains that they cannot because he is seeing someone else and rejects her bluntly, which distresses Alice. Meanwhile, Meg has a change of heart and decides to have a child via sperm donor.
Shortly after learning she is pregnant, Meg unexpectedly hooks up with a younger man, Ken (Jake Lacy), after meeting him at Alice's office Christmas Party. Ken who is the law office receptionist, is smitten with her. She repeatedly tries to break it off, but he continues to cutely pursue her.

Risen,"After crushing a Zealot revolt led by Barabbas, Clavius, a Roman Tribune, is sent by Pontius Pilate to expedite a crucifixion already in progress. Three days later he is appointed to investigate the rumors of a risen Jewish Messiah. Pilate orders him to locate the missing body of Yeshua, one of the crucified men. In doing so, Pilate seeks to quell an imminent uprising in Jerusalem before the Emperor arrives.[4] Failing to secure Yeshua's body, Clavius, with the support of his loyal aide Lucius, attempts to locate and question the disciples of Yeshua and those involved in his crucifixion and burial for clues to his disappearance.
Numerous leads are dug up, and their accounts soon become increasingly miraculous and difficult to believe. Some of the followers, like a prostitute named Mary Magdalene and a man named Bartholomew, seemingly speak only in riddles and refuse to betray any others. Clavius' intense investigative methods soon begin to disturb both Romans and Hebrews alike, and Pilate, under pressure from many sides and fearful of Caesar's wrath, becomes increasingly distant and unsupportive. Running out of new leads, Clavius revisits a disgraced Roman soldier, assigned to guard Yeshua's cave tomb, now little more than a drunkard, and vehemently shakes the drunken man out of a lie that he had previously stuck to. The soldier recounts a fantastic story that, on the morning Yeshua disappeared, a blinding flash had appeared, during which the stone and ropes sealing the tomb disintegrated, and a figure appeared, accompanied by a booming voice that sent him and a fellow soldier running away in fear, and that he had not seen anything like this before. Clavius, however, believes that the soldier was merely drunk. Other informants also fail to provide much useful information.
During a raid through a Jewish enclave, Clavius unexpectedly discovers a seemingly resurrected Yeshua with his apostles in a solitary abode. A stunned Clavius calls off the search; dispersing his troops without revealing to them his personal encounter with the risen Yeshua. That night, another Roman raid, led by Lucius and Pilate, attacks the building that Clavius had forbidden them from entering, and finds it empty, save a note from Clavius, who has decided to continue the investigation on his own. Having abandoned Roman polytheism and the god Mars, Clavius, at first distrustful of the group, soon joins Yeshua and his followers on a journey to determine the validity of his mortal rejuvenation, during which he receives counseling from and befriends both Yeshua and the apostle Peter.
Pilate deduces that Clavius has apparently betrayed him, and dispatches a contingent of Roman troops, led by a promoted Lucius, to pursue him and Yeshua. Clavius assists the disciples in evading the Roman search party, and, when caught personally by Lucius, Clavius disarms him, then convinces him to let them pass quietly. Consequently, Clavius witnesses Yeshua's miraculous healing of a leper, and then the ascension of Yeshua into Heaven; after which the Apostles split up to resume their journeys, and Clavius bids farewell to Peter. Later, communicating his travels to a stranger in a remote dwelling, Clavius acknowledges the vivifying wisdom which he observed through Yeshua, feeling he will never be the same."
The Witch,"In 1630s New England, a man named William is banished from a Puritan plantation alongside his wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas, due to a difference in interpretation of the New Testament. The family leaves the plantation and builds a farm by the edge of a large, secluded forest far from the Puritan settlement. Katherine soon gives birth to her fifth child, Samuel. Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel when he abruptly disappears. Samuel is then revealed to the viewer but not to his family to have been kidnapped by a witch, who crushes his body to pulp and uses it to make a flying ointment.[6]
Katherine, devastated, spends her days crying and praying. William takes Caleb hunting in the forest and confides to his son that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. On the farm, the twins play with the family's goat, Black Phillip, claiming that he speaks to them. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her silver cup while implying Thomasin was responsible for the disappearance of Samuel. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family.
Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to hunt in the forest. She forces Caleb to take her with him by threatening to awaken their father. Their dog gives chase to a hare and Caleb follows on foot as the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and eventually stumbles upon the disemboweled corpse of his dog. He later discovers a moss-covered hovel. A seductive young woman appears at the door and lures Caleb towards her. Meanwhile, Thomasin awakens and reunites with her father, who is searching for her and Caleb. Katherine confronts Thomasin about taking Caleb into the woods and William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup.
That night, Caleb is found outside in the rain, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. Katherine suggests that her son's mysterious ailment is due to witchcraft and prays over him. The next day, Caleb suffers a violent seizure and expels a small apple from his mouth before dying. As Caleb nears death, his parents and Thomasin kneel reciting the Lord's Prayer which causes great distress to the twins who insist they cannot remember the words and implore the others to stop. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, she reveals their conversations with Black Phillip. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. After dark, the twins and Thomasin awaken to find a hideous naked old woman drinking a white goat's blood. Meanwhile, Katherine is overjoyed by a vision of Caleb and Samuel's return. She begins breastfeeding the infant which is revealed to be a black raven pecking at her exposed and bloody breast.
The next day William finds the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. William, dying, picks up an axe and contemplates killing the goat, but resigns himself to death and quotes from the Book of Job before being knocked into a woodpile. The commotion awakens the unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and tries to strangle her. Thomasin grabs a nearby billhook and kills her in self-defense.
Night falls and Thomasin, in desperation, urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds in human tongue and suddenly transforms into a man. He convinces her to sign her name in his book, guiding her hand as she does so and offering her the sights of the world and the luxurious life she wants to live. Thomasin wanders naked into the forest with Black Phillip, again incarnated as a goat, where she discovers a coven of witches dancing around a bonfire. The witches begin to levitate and a laughing Thomasin joins them above the trees."
Race,"Jesse Owens, a promising black American runner, attends Ohio State University, despite facing racial discrimination and slurs from the white athletes. He attracts the attention of coach Larry Snyder, who believes Owens has enormous potential but needs work on his form and technique. When Snyder suggests he is good enough to compete at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, Owens is interested, but hesitant because of racial propaganda in Nazi Germany. The U.S. Olympic Committee is already considering boycotting the Olympics over Germany's discriminatory policies, only agreeing to participate when Nazi official Joseph Goebbels gives personal assurances they will allow foreign athletes of any race to compete, as well as promising to rein in their propaganda.
As Owens struggles to support his girlfriend Ruth and young daughter, he takes a job at a service station, upsetting Snyder when his job conflicts with his commitment to train. When Snyder learns Owens has a family to support, he gets him a no-show job, allowing him to focus on running. Owens goes on to break several records, including some of Snyder's, and begins a relationship with a woman whose attentions he attracts with his newfound fame. When Ruth threatens him with a lawsuit, Owens becomes distracted and loses a race to runner Eulace Peacock. Owens decides to return to Ruth to reconcile, convincing her to marry him. As the Olympics draw closer, the NAACP asks him not to go to Berlin for political reasons. Owens is conflicted, but Peacock urges him to compete to defy Nazi racial ideology.
In Berlin, Owens wins his first gold medal in the 100 m dash, but when he is brought by International Olympic Committee member Avery Brundage to receive congratulations from Adolf Hitler, he is told the Chancellor has left the stadium early to avoid traffic. Brundage warns Goebbels that Hitler must congratulate all winners or no winners, with Goebbels replying Hitler will not appear with ""that"". Owens next qualifies for the broad jump after German rival Luz Long unexpectedly gives him tips on his technique. Owens wins another medal, and Luz publicly shakes his hand and joins him for a victory lap, privately expressing concern about national politics. Owens wins his fourth and final medal in the 4 x 100 m relay, filling in for two Jewish American athletes cut by Brundage, who is convinced by Goebbels to do so to avoid a scandal over a business arrangement Brundage entered with the Nazis before the games. Director Leni Riefenstahl films the event against Goebbels' orders, then asks Owens to repeat his medal-winning broad jump to get a few more shots for her next film, Olympia."
Gods of Egypt,"In an alternate version of Egypt, the world is flat and the Egyptian gods live among humans, they differ from humans by their greater height, golden blood, and ability to transform into their divine forms.
A young thief named Bek and his love Zaya are attending the coronation of Horus. During the ceremony, Osiris is killed by his extremely jealous brother Set, who seizes the throne and declares a new regime where the dead will have to pay with riches to pass into the afterlife. Horus is stripped of his eyes, the source of his power, and almost killed. His love, Hathor pleads with Set in surrender to spare him and he is instead exiled.
A year later, Bek has been working as a slave building monuments while Zaya is now under the ownership of Set's chief architect Urshu. Believing that Horus is the only one who can defeat Set, she gives Bek the floor plans to his treasure vault and also manages to get a glimpse of the plans for his pyramid. Bek is able to steal back one of Horus' eyes from the treasure vault. However, Urshu finds out and kills Zaya as the couple flee. Bek takes her body to the blind Horus and makes a bargain: Horus agrees to bring Zaya back from the dead for his eye and Bek's knowledge about Set's pyramid.
The two fly to the divine vessel of Horus' grandfather Ra. Horus is unable to convince his grandfather to regrant him his power so he can defeat Set himself, as Ra is both neutral about their conflict and daily at war with the enormous shadow beast Apophis that threatens to devour the world. Ra does however allow Horus to obtain a vial of the divine waters that surround his vessel, which can extinguish the desert thirst and weaken Set gravely. Ra tells Horus that his weakness is the result of him not fulfilling his destiny, which Horus believes means avenging his parents' deaths.
Elsewhere, Set asks Hathor to take him to the underworld, but she refuses and manages to escape. After surviving an attack by Set's Egyptian Minotaurs led by Mnevis and an attack by some of Set's minions and their giant cobras, Hathor finds and saves Bek and Horus. Horus at first doesn't trust her as she is a mistress of Set, while she tries to convince him that Set is her enemy as well. When they tell her of their plan regarding Set's pyramid, she warns them of a guardian sphinx who will kill anyone not wise enough to solve a riddle. The group then heads to the library of Thoth, so they can recruit him to solve the riddle.
Arriving at Set's pyramid, they overcome its traps including the sphinx, to reach the source of Set's power. But before they can pour the divine water, Set traps them and reveals to Bek that Horus cannot bring Zaya back from the dead. Set destroys their flask and kills Thoth by taking his brain. Horus is able to save Hathor and Bek. Horus admits to caring more about his revenge than the mortals. Hathor sacrifices her own safety for Zaya's payment into the afterlife by giving Bek her bracelet and calls Anubis to take him to Zaya, letting herself be dragged to the underworld.
Having combined Thoth's brain, Osiris's heart, Horus's eye, and wings from Nephthys with himself, Set travels to Ra, questioning his favoritism for Osiris and denying him the throne and children. Ra claims that all of Set's prior mistreatments were tests preparing Set for his true role: the honor and burden of taking Ra's place as the defender of the world aboard his solar barge, fighting against the demon Apophis. Set is dismayed to hear his destiny and wants to destroy the afterlife so that he can be immortal. Ra tries to fight Set by blasting him with his spear, though Set survives. He stabs Ra to his surprise, takes his spear of power, and casts him off the boat freeing Apophis to consume both the mortal and underworld realms.
Bek finds Zaya, who refuses Hathor's gift as she doesn't want an afterlife without Bek, but then Apophis attacks and the gate to the afterlife is closed. Bek returns to the mortal world, where Horus is amazed that Bek still wants to help take down Set. Bek tells him it was Zaya who told him to, as she still has faith in Horus.
Horus climbs up the outer wall of an obelisk Set is standing on and attempts to battle him, but is heavily outmatched. Whilst Bek fights Urshu who is thrown off to his death, Bek ascends on the inside and joins the battle, removing Horus's stolen eye from Set's armor, being wounded in the process. As Bek slides toward the edge of the obelisk, he throws the eye toward Horus, who must choose to catch it or save Bek instead. Horus reaches for Bek and apologizes for all he has put him through. As they plummet toward the ground, Horus finds that he now has the power to transform into his divine form and he catches Bek and flies him to safety. Horus realizes that it wasn't the recovery of his eye nor revenge that was his destiny, it was the protection of his people that he needed to fight for. Now, Horus has the strength for battling Set, and he gains the obelisk and kills him. After the battle and Set's death, he then finds Ra wounded and floating in space, and returns his spear to him, allowing Ra to once again repel Apophis and for Anubis to reopen the gates.
As Horus returns to Bek, a child holds out his other eye which she has found, while people cheer him. But Horus's joy turns to sadness as he arrives to find Bek dying from the wounds he sustained whilst fighting Set. Horus carries him to Osiris's tomb and lays him beside Zaya. Ra arrives and offers to bestow any power on him to repay Horus for his life and Egypt's survival. All Horus wants is bringing Bek and Zaya back to life. The other gods are also revived and have their attributes restored (except for Osiris and Isis, who died a full year before and have already passed into the Afterlife). Horus is crowned king by Thoth and declares the afterlife will be for those who do good in the world. Bek is made chief advisor, and he gives Horus back Hathor's bracelet letting him leave to rescue her from the underworld."
Triple 9,"In Atlanta, Georgia, criminals Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Russell Welch (Norman Reedus), and his brother Gabe (Aaron Paul), along with two corrupt cops, Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.), rob a bank to retrieve a safe deposit box. The box contains information that could overturn the recent conviction of a Jewish-Russian Mafia boss. When Michael brings the safe deposit box to the boss' wife, Irina (Kate Winslet), she withholds their reward money and gives Michael and his crew another mission, which involves breaking into a government office and stealing more data on her husband. To convince them to take the job, the mafia tortures and then dumps a mortally wounded Russell off in front of the crew, forcing Michael to mercy-kill Russell in front of them, traumatizing Gabe.
The group decides to go forward with the job. As they think of ways they can pull it off, Marcus and Franco suggest a Triple 9 scenario, which involves an officer down call that sends all of the police to the location of the incident, with Marcus nominating his new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). Marcus tries to befriend Chris as they go out on calls together. During one call, Chris attempts to question a local gang member, Luis Pinto (Luis Da Silva), about a gang-related homicide, only for Luis to attack Chris before being detained for his actions. Chris's uncle, Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson), is a Sgt. Detective in the police force working on the bank robbery case. Jeffrey gets a lead and discovers that Gabe is one of the people involved in the bank robbery. Gabe, still grieving over his brother, tries to stop the heist from happening by following Chris and Marcus around and telling Chris, but is stopped both by Michael and Jeffrey.
On the day of the heist, Marcus takes Chris to an abandoned housing project to meet an informant with information on their homicide case. As they walk around the building, Marcus slips away, and Luis comes in and tries to find Chris. Chris bumps into Gabe who tries to warn him that he is going to die. Luis then charges in and tries to shoot Chris but hits Gabe. As Luis runs away, Chris confronts a critically wounded Gabe. Before Gabe can say anything, Marcus comes in, triggering a shootout between the two. Gabe is killed, and Marcus is shot in the head. Fearing Marcus is dead, Chris makes the Triple 9 call. Thinking his nephew is the officer down, Jeffrey rushes to the scene. Meanwhile, Michael and Franco break into the government office and steal the information with little police disruption. Luis flees the projects and is later shot dead by SWAT after barricading himself in a nearby home.
In the aftermath, Marcus survives but is in critical condition. Michael meets with Irina and her henchmen for the exchange. He has a gift for his son to give to him upon their reunion. Irina gives him the money but does not bring Michael's son as she had promised to earlier. Michael and Irina were earlier revealed to have a family relationship: the mother of Michael's son is Irina's sister; nonetheless, Irina refers to Michael as a ""monkey."" After being beaten by her henchmen, Michael walks back to his car and triggers a bomb that was wired into his gift, killing Irina and her thugs. As he drives away, Michael is pulled over by Franco, who kills him and steals the money. After investigating Luis's belongings at the morgue, Chris finds a note in Luis's wallet, which contained the location where Marcus took him the day of the shooting. Chris later finds out that Marcus met Luis the day of the shooting, letting him know where to kill Chris. Angered, Chris visits an unconscious Marcus to try to get answers but is interrupted by Franco, who invites Chris back to the station to get his account of the shooting. As the two head to the car, Chris receives a call from Jeffrey, who tells him that Franco has been cleaning house and that he might be next. Chris, clutching his holstered weapon, stops and tells Franco that he’ll meet him at the station. Franco, realizing Chris has been tipped of his involvement, agrees to meet Chris there. As the two head out to their respective cars, Jeffrey is seen inside Franco's car, and they both shoot each other when Franco takes a seat in his car. Franco is killed, and Jeffrey is shot in the abdomen. As Chris makes a Triple 9 call, Jeffrey calmly pulls a joint and smokes it. Jeffrey's fate is left unknown."
Zootopia,"In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps from rural Bunnyburrow fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a police officer in urban Zootopia. Despite being the academy valedictorian, Judy is delegated to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. On her first day, she is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.
The next day, Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of crocus bulbs known as Midnicampum holicithias. Bogo reprimands her, but Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen predators who are missing. When Judy volunteers and Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment, Bogo gives her 48 hours to find Otterton on the condition that she resign if she fails.
Judy blackmails Nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to tax evasion. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went ""savage""—reverted to a feral state—and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about ""night howlers"" before the attack. Moments later, Manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but when they arrive, Manchas has vanished. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick reminds Bogo that Judy still has ten hours to solve the case.
At City Hall, Bellwether offers Judy and Nick access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the ""night howlers"". They locate the missing predators—all gone savage—imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Mayor Leodore Lionheart hides them from the public while trying to determine the cause of their behavior. Lionheart and those involved are arrested for false imprisonment and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.
Judy, praised for solving the case, has become friends with Nick and asks him to join the ZPD as her partner. However, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a predatory biological cause for the recent savage behavior, and her comments cause tension between predators and prey throughout the city. Feeling guilty for the results of her words, Judy quits her job.
Back in Bunnyburrow, Judy learns that the night howlers are actually toxic flowers that have severe psychotropic effects on mammals. After returning to Zootopia and reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who tells them the bulbs he stole were for a ram named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway, developing a drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a dart gun.
Judy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and takes the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Judy and Nick are trapped after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. Bellwether shoots a serum pellet at Nick to make him kill Judy, and summons the ZPD for help, but Judy and Nick have replaced the serum pellets in Bellwether's gun with blueberries. Enraged, Bellwether threatens to frame the pair for the attacks, but Judy has recorded Bellwether's confession. Bogo and the ZPD arrive and Bellwether is arrested.
Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of Bellwether's plot and states that his imprisonment of the savage predators was a ""wrong thing for the right reason"". With the cause of the epidemic identified, the savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner."
London Has Fallen,"Western intelligence services of the G8 track down Pakistani arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) as the mastermind behind several terrorist attacks, and authorize an American drone strike on Barkawi's compound, apparently killing Barkawi and his family.
Two years later, UK Prime Minister James Wilson suddenly dies, and arrangements are made for the Western world leaders to attend his funeral in London. Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) assigns agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), a close friend of U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), to lead Asher's security detail while overseas, even though Banning's wife Leah (Radha Mitchell) is due to give birth to their child in a few weeks. The entourage arrives via Air Force One at Stansted Airport, and Banning pushes their arrival at the Somerset House in London via Marine One earlier. As Asher's Presidential State Car arrives at St Paul's Cathedral, a series of coordinated attacks by terrorists disguised as Metropolitan Police, the Queen's Guardsmen, and other first responders erupts, killing the other Western leaders, damaging or destroying major landmarks and generating mass panic. Asher's early arrival has thrown the attack on him at St. Paul's off-guard, and Banning is able to rescue Asher and Jacobs and rushes them back to Marine One. As the helicopter and its escorts takes off, terrorists fire Stinger missiles at them, destroying the escorts and forcing the damaged helicopter to crash-land in Hyde Park. Banning and Asher suffer only minor wounds, but Jacobs is fatally injured, and she makes Banning promise to stay alive for his unborn child and get back at whomever did this. Banning quickly escorts Asher into the London Underground as the city's power is lost and people take shelter in their homes.
In Washington, D.C., U.S. Vice President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) works with the British authorities to investigate the incident while trying to track down the President. Trumbull receives a call from Barkawi, still alive after all and operating out of Yemen. The man takes responsibility for the attacks, coordinated by his son Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter). Barkawi purposely had Wilson poisoned to lure the Western leaders to London to attack them. Barkawi knows Asher is still alive, and promises that if Kamran captures him, he will broadcast the execution of the President on the Internet. Trumbull orders his intelligence staff to locate Barkawi's known operatives to find any connection to the attack, while British authorities have all first responders stand down, so that any left in the open can be identified as terrorists.
After leaving a sign to be picked up by satellite tracking, Banning leads Asher to an MI6 safe-house, where Jacqueline ""Jax"" Marshall (Charlotte Riley) briefs them on what their intelligence has learned. Marshall receives a voice message from Trumbull that confirms they saw Banning's sign and that an extraction team is en route. Security monitors show the approach of a Delta Force team, but Banning suspects they have arrived far too soon and may be more terrorists. He covers and fights off the terrorists before Asher and Banning drive away, but their car is struck by a truck driven by terrorists, allowing them to kidnap Asher. Banning is rescued by the extraction team, a combined Delta Force/S.A.S. squad. They also suspect that there is a mole in the British government.
Trumbull's staff have identified a building in London owned by one of Barkawi's companies, which still appears to be drawing massive amounts of power despite supposedly being under construction and unoccupied, and suspect it is Kamran's headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building and stop Kamran before he can kill Asher. Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists. Marshall has worked with British authorities to restore London's security system and, discovering that MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster (Patrick Kennedy) aided in Barkawi's attack, she kills him. Meanwhile, Trumbull contacts Barkawi to tell him that his plan failed, and then to look outside, moments before the building is destroyed by another drone strike, killing him.
Two weeks after the attack on London, Banning is home spending time with Leah and their newborn child, named Lynne after his deceased boss. He sits in front of his laptop and contemplates sending his letter of resignation. On TV, Trumbull speaks regarding the recent events, leaving an inspiring message that the U.S. will prevail. This convinces Banning to delete the letter."
Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,"In 2003 New York City, dissatisfied with the state of her career covering low-profile stories, television journalist Kim Baker (Tina Fey) agrees to take a short assignment as a war correspondent in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom, to the disappointment of her boyfriend Chris (Josh Charles), who also spends a lot of time traveling. Assigned low-budget living quarters with other international journalists, she begins friendships with noted BBC correspondent Tanya Vanderpoel (Margot Robbie) and lecherous Scottish freelance photographer Iain MacKelpie (Martin Freeman). After a period of adjustment aided by her Afghan ""fixer"" Fahim Ahmadzai (Christopher Abbott), she begins taking well to the assignment, eliciting frank remarks on camera from soldiers questioning the value of their assignment there, and putting herself in harm's way to capture combat incidents on video. American Marine commander General (previously Colonel) Hollanek (Billy Bob Thornton) takes a dim view of her as an inexperienced nuisance.
Despite the danger, Kim stays in Afghanistan for months, then years beyond her original assignment. She catches Chris unprepared with a middle-of-the-night video call, and finds him with another woman, ending their relationship. Against her better judgment, she begins a sexual relationship with Iain, which over time also develops into a more personal one. Although her status as a woman presents challenges in an Afghan Islamic society which places restrictive roles on women, she also uses it to her advantage, gaining access to women in a village who explain that they've been sabotaging the US-built well because they welcome the daily walk to the river away from the men, and recklessly, carrying a camera under a burqa to record a religious demonstration. She also walks a tightrope, taking advantage of the thinly-veiled sexual interest of Afghan Attorney General Ali Massoud Sadiq (Alfred Molina) to use him as a source. Fahim – who treated opium addicts before the war – cautions her, pointing out that danger can be like a drug.
Despite their mutual friendliness, Kim remains in competition with other journalists for stories and for resources from their employers back home. After three years in Afghanistan, Kim flies to New York to argue for more support from her network's new boss, only to discover that Tanya is slated to take over from her. Meanwhile, Iain is kidnapped for ransom while traveling cross-country to cover a developing story that Iain had earlier offered to bring Kim in on. Kim returns ""home"" to Afghanistan, where she blackmails her ""special friend"", Ali, for information about Iain's whereabouts, and impresses upon Hollanek the political value to him of rescuing Iain. The mission – accompanied by Kim's cameraman – is a success, both militarily and journalistically. However, shortly after Iain's rescue Kim becomes disillusioned with both her tentative relationship and her station. She then bids farewell to her colleagues and to Fahim, and returns to the U.S. to stay.
After returning, she looks up a Marine (Evan Jonigkeit) who was transferred, apparently because of his on-camera comments to her, and subsequently lost both of his legs to an IED. She tries to apologize for the consequences of her actions, but he refuses to let her take the blame. She moves on to an on-camera desk job, where she later finds herself interviewing Iain, who is going to be in New York soon as part of a tour for his new book, and who invites her to meet him for coffee."
The Other Side of the Door,"Sets in the 19th century, the plot centered on a man (Harold Lockwood) who is falsely accused of murder. The Other Side of the Door was shot in Monterrey, Mexico.[1]"
10 Cloverfield Lane,"After breaking up with her boyfriend Ben, Michelle drives away from New Orleans. While in rural Louisiana, she hears news reports of blackouts in several major cities before she is sideswiped by a truck and knocked off the road, falling unconscious.
Michelle wakes in a locked room within an underground bunker, her wounds tended to. Howard, the bunker's owner, tells her he brought her there for her protection, claiming that the air outside has been poisoned by nuclear or chemical fallout from an unknown force. Michelle is initially hostile towards Howard, but once she has calmed down, Howard takes her on a tour of the well-stocked bunker, and meets Emmett, another survivor who found his way to it. Howard takes her to the viewport of the bunker's exit hatch, showing her two dead pigs outside as evidence of the fallout; Michelle also sees Howard's truck, and recognizes it from the accident. Michelle privately relays her concerns about Howard's motivations to Emmett.
During their first dinner together, Michelle secretly takes Howard's keys and makes her way to the hatch, but as she is about to open it, a woman, Leslie, covered in skin lesions, slams against the window demanding she be let in, then collapses. Michelle openly returns the keys and agrees that Howard was right. Howard admits to accidentally hitting her car in his panic to get to the shelter.
While the trio's relationship becomes more relaxed, Howard still shows intolerance towards Emmett and treats Michelle as a little girl; however, Howard opens up about his daughter who he states is ""not with us anymore"". Howard enlists Michelle to fix the air filtration unit when it fails since she is small enough to fit through the vents; while repairing it, she finds a locked skylight, with the word ""HELP"" scratched into its glass and visible to anyone outside. Further suspicious of Howard, Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard's purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier, and they suspect he abducted her to the bunker. They make plans to escape the bunker, creating a makeshift Hazmat suit behind Howard's back. When Howard discovers tools and parts missing, he accuses the two of stealing them, threatening to immerse them in a barrel of perchloric acid. When Emmett takes sole responsibility, Howard coldly kills Emmett with a gun. In shock, Michelle is desperately making final preparations to leave, when she is surprised by Howard. She manages to escape from him with the suit. En route, she knocks over the acid barrel, burning Howard and starting an electrical fire in the bunker.
Michelle dons the suit and escapes the burning bunker onto Howard's homestead. Seeing signs of living wildlife, she takes off the suit's helmet, but then she suddenly sees a giant biomechanical alien spacecraft, drawn by the bunker fire; the craft emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit. Her delay allows mechanical appendages from the ship to capture her, but she is able to craft a Molotov cocktail from items in Howard's truck to throw into the ship. The fireball causes the appendage to drop her, and she is able to take the dead woman's car and escape.
As she nears the Texas border she hears radio chatter instructing any survivors to head to Baton Rouge to evacuate, but requests the help of any able-bodied person in Houston. At a crossroads, she pauses a moment before driving off towards Houston. In the distance, larger alien craft can be seen in the sky."
The Young Messiah,"At the age of 7, when Jesus returns from Egypt to his home in Nazareth with his family, he discovers the truth about his life.[7][8] He realizes he is the Son of God, sent by God, to be the savior of humanity.
The movie begins with Jesus playing in Alexandria with his cousins when one of the local boys ""Eliezer"" beats Jesus and then turns to his female cousin. Satan throws an apple before the bully Eliezer and he falls to his death. Then Satan turns the crowd against the young boy Jesus and they gather around accusing him of cursing Eliezer. His mother saves him from the mob but as he and his cousins hide in the house they ask the young Jesus to do to Eliezer what he did to the young bird. The camera cuts to a flashback of a young Jesus bringing a dead bird to life.
Jesus sneaks out of the house and into Eliezer's home where preparations are being made for his disemboweling and burial. When he raises Eliezer from the dead the boy promptly resumes beating Jesus. Eliezer's parents ask Joseph , Jesus and Mary to leave Alexandria saying ""7 years is more than enough"".
Joseph tells Mary, uncle Cleopas and his extended family that he had a dream and it is time to return to Israel because Herod is dead. Mary insists on returning to Nazareth instead of Bethlehem. The family departs for Israel.
On the road to Israel Jesus and his family encounter an increasingly unwell Cleopas coughing and though Mrs. Cleopas asks Jesus to heal him , Jesus says he cannot because he has been asked not to. As the family rests Jesus runs off to play and walks straight into an ambush with rebellious Jews waiting for a passing Roman cavalry. One of the rebels tries to shoo away the boy Jesus and when the Romans become suspicious and the attack commences the rebel pushes away the young Jesus from harm's way and sacrifices his own life. One of the Centurions save the boy Jesus from one of the Roman soldiers.
Jesus runs back to his family to find Cleopas increasingly delirious and raving by the river Jordan. Jesus cannot resist and moves to heal his uncle Cleopas. As he heals his uncle the news spreads and reaches the new Jewish King who orders his Roman Centurion to find the boy healer and execute him.
Jesus and the family run into a man raping a lady by the roadside . The lady knifes the attacker and kills him. Joseph and Uncle Cleopas bury the dead attacker and the victim joins the family on their road to Nazareth. On the way to Nazareth Jesus and the holy family encounter crucifixions of Jewish rebels.
Upon arrival at their family home in Nazareth the Roman soldiers arrive and accuse them of banditry and rebellion. Grandmother Sarah arrives in the nick of time and share sweet cakes and good wine to give to the soldiers. The soldiers are won over by the hospitality and spare Joseph and the extended clan.
The centurion returns to Herod in the middle of a belly dancing entertainment. He informs the Centurion that he just crucified a man who told him about the return of Jesus. The crucified informant tells the Centurion of the general direction and informs him of a camel he gave to the boy as a gift.
The child Jesus is taken to the rabbi for schooling. He amazes them with his wisdom and knowledge and they accept him but Jesus faints on the way back. Satan torments Jesus as he lies unwell and tells him that his little miracles will mean nothing.
Jesus is restored to health and he asks to visit Jerusalem for Passover. The centurions track Jesus to Sarah's house in Nazareth but they have already departed for Jerusalem. The soldiers extract information about the boy's name. The soldiers intercept the travelers on the road but the family departs from the road and hides in the caves.
Jesus departs from the cave in the middle of the night for Jerusalem all by himself asking God for guidance and safety. Jesus enters Jerusalem, his parents follow looking for him. Jesus is given some coins by well meaning pilgrims and he uses the coins to save a sacrificial dove and sets it free. Jesus finds a blind rabbi and asks about what happened 7 years ago in Bethlehem. Satan guides the Centurions to the boy by the rabbi. The rabbi is healed by the young Jesus.
The centurion corners Jesus and the people in the temple gather around Jesus claiming him to be the boy who healed the Rabbi. The Centurion Severus recognizing that all eyes are on him desists from killing the boy and asks them to leave the temple.
Severus the Centurion falsely reports to Herod that the young Jesus was murdered by him. Mary tells Jesus the answers to all the questions he was looking for. The movie ends with Jesus running to his family and just wanting to be a child."

Miracles from Heaven,"Set in Burleson, Texas, between 2008 and 2012, the film centers on a 10-year-old girl named Annabel Beam, daughter of Christy Beam. One day, Anna starts to vomit, and when examined by her doctor, he does not find anything abnormal. On March 20, 2008, Anna wakes up her family at midnight because of an intense stomach pain severe enough that her parents decide to take her to the hospital. Doctors find no signs of illness, except to say it could be either acid reflux, or lactose intolerance, but Christy is not convinced by this. The following morning, Christy finally finds a pediatrician in the hospital that is able to diagnose Anna with an abdominal obstruction, and he tells them he must operate immediately or she will die. After the emergency surgery is performed, the doctor explains that Anna has been left with pseudo-obstruction motility disorder and she is unable to eat, so feeding tubes are needed for her nutrition. The doctor then tells the Beams' about America's foremost pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Nurko, who practices in Boston, but explains it could take months for them to be seen. In January 2009, Christy and Anna travel to Boston despite not having an appointment with the doctor.
Dr. Nurko has a last minute opening, and when Anna is subsequently examined at Boston Children's Hospital, the extent of her chronic illness is found. She then goes through extensive treatment. During this ordeal, Anna and her mother befriend a local Massachusetts resident named Angela, as well as Ben and his sick daughter, Haley.
On December 29, 2011, Anna, along with her bigger sister Abbie, climb up to a very high branch of an old cotton tree. While they are on that branch, it begins to break. Anna goes to the trunk for safety, whereupon stepping on it, she falls in a hole to the base of the tree. When Christy finds out what has happened, she desperately calls her husband, as well as the fire department. Anna is then rescued by the firefighters, who warn Christy to expect the worst by saying that nobody could fall 30 feet without sustaining a serious injury; broken bones or paralysis. Once out, Anna is airlifted to a hospital, where a battery of tests are run on her, and all of the tests come back negative. Other than a minor concussion, Anna is uninjured.
Sometime after the fall, Anna seems to no longer be affected by her illness. When Christy and Anna go to an appointment with Dr. Nurko, he tells Christy that Anna is miraculously cured. Anna then recounts with her parents the experience she had during the fall. She describes how her soul left her body during the fall, and God promised that she would be cured of her illness upon her return to Earth. At church, Christy shares the story of how God miraculously healed her daughter with His love. As Christy finishes her speech, one of the congregation protests, stating that she does not believe Christy. Ben, who has traveled from Boston upon hearing the story about Anna, believes her and tells her that his daughter Haley died peacefully because Anna gave her faith when in the hospital."
The Divergent Series: Allegiant,"After Evelyn forbids anyone from leaving Chicago, she announces that all Erudite members involved in the previous coup attempt are to be put on trial and executed if found guilty. Tris and Four rescue Caleb from execution and try to escape over the wall, along with Tori, Peter and Christina. The group is ambushed by Edgar, who kills Tori, but the group escapes, and pass the wall and are intercepted by soldiers with advanced weaponry who take the group to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, a city of advanced technology hidden behind a cloaking shield. They learn that years ago the U.N believed that society's problems were caused by ""damaged genes"". In an attempt to create a better society they began to tamper with people's genes; this eventually led to the Purity Wars and the destruction of most of the planet. To try to reverse the destruction a series of ""experiments"" were set up in an attempt to repair this mistake, establishing isolated cities across the remains of the world.
Tris and Four are tested by Matthew and Nita to verify and study their Divergence. Tris is shown to be truly Divergent, and the first Chicago Divergent to be 100% genetically pure, but Four's genetic structure indicates that his genes still carry damage. Caleb and Peter are assigned to surveillance teams that remotely monitor Chicago, while Christine and Four are assigned to the military. Matthew then brings Tris to the leader of the Bureau, David (Jeff Daniels). David gives Tris a device that allows her to view her foster mother's memories, and she sees that her mother was rescued from the wastelands as a child before volunteering to join the Chicago experiment out of dedication to the project. In return for his help in restoring peace to Chicago, which David claims only the council has the power to intervene in, Tris agrees to help David continue the experiment.
Meanwhile, Four and Christina train with Nita. They join the military on a rescue mission to a nearby wasteland village, though Four becomes mistrustful of the Bureau's intentions after realizing that they are simply kidnapping children and wiping their memories with amnesia gas. Four also attempts to warn Tris of the Bureau's intentions, but they are interrupted by a video call from David.
Caleb warns Four of a rapidly escalating conflict back in Chicago between Johanna's group of Allegiants and Evelyn's factionless. Four appeals to Tris for her to return to Chicago with him to end the bloodshed, but she decides to go with David. David agrees to reinsert Four back into Chicago, escorted by Matthew and some Bureau soldiers. Once in the air, Matthew quietly reveals to Four that the flight is a trap and he is meant to be killed. A skirmish breaks out and Four defeats all of the soldiers, though the transport crashes as a result. Matthew gives Four a device to allow passage through the cloaking shield, and Four proceeds to Chicago while Matthew remains behind to be rescued by the Bureau and warn Tris.
Meanwhile, Tris and David meet with the council. Tris disagrees with the council's objectives and criticizes how they have done nothing to stop the violence in Chicago. The council responds that David has full power to intervene whenever he desires, revealing that he has lied to her from the beginning. During the return flight to the Bureau, Tris ends their partnership. Upon her return, she gathers Caleb and Christina in David's hovercar to return to Chicago. Nita helps them escape, revealing the Davids rule is not popular with everyone in the Bureau.
Four is captured by the factionless and confronts Evelyn to end the violence. Tris, Caleb, and Christina arrive to find the city tearing itself apart at the opening stage of a full assault by the Allegiant. Back at the Bureau David makes a deal with Peter in exchange for Peter's promotion and inserts him into Chicago to convince Evelyn to deploy a hidden Bureau stockpile of amnesia gas to wipe the memories of the attackers and force a peace in her favor, to which she agrees. Peter takes her to a hidden vault.
Tris and Christina fight through the factionless and arrive at the vault, having rescued Four along the way. At the vault door, Four convinces Evelyn to stop the gas attack, as he would not remember that she was his mother if she carried it out. She capitulates and stops the release, but is shot in the leg by a frustrated Peter. Peter gloats until the same gas starts flooding the vault as well. Realizing David has betrayed him, Peter opens the vault so Tris and Four can stop the gas release, and flees back towards the cloaking shield, as Four says he will find and kill Peter.
Caleb arrives and aids Tris in destroying the gas dispersion hub, stopping the release. The group gathers atop the Erudite building as they watch David's shuttle autopilot back towards the Bureau, heavily laden with explosives. Tris transmits a message to the whole world, revealing to them the existence of the Bureau and that Chicago was an experiment in genetic purity. Her message to the Bureau is that Chicago is no longer their experiment, but the home of its citizens. Caleb detonates the explosives at the end of the message, tearing a massive hole through the cloak wall and revealing the Bureau. As the group watches, David's image is revealed standing behind Tris via a Bureau remote viewing device."
The Bronze,"Former gymnastics Bronze Medalist Hope Ann Greggory (Melissa Rauch) has been living off her celebrity status in her hometown of Amherst, Ohio, though she is reduced to going through the mail her mailman father delivers for spending money. When her former coach Pavleck (Christine Abrahamsen) suddenly commits suicide, a letter arrives addressed to Hope stating that if she can guide Pavleck's best student, a young gymnastics star named Maggie Townsend (Haley Lu Richardson) to the Olympics in Toronto, she will receive a $500,000 inheritance.
Unwilling to be overshadowed by Maggie's success, Hope instead plans to take the money by sabotaging Maggie's training so she can stay on top, initially feeding her junk food and a shake laced with marijuana. Maggie performs so poorly that arrogant Olympic Gold Medalist Lance Tucker (Sebastian Stan), who resents Hope's celebrity on account of her inferior bronze medal (which she won despite a career-ending injury) threatens to take over as Maggie's coach. When Hope learns she will forfeit the inheritance money if she does not continue training Maggie, Hope grudgingly devotes herself to Maggie's training in earnest. Along the way, she enters a romance with her assistant coach Ben Lawfort (Thomas Middleditch), nicknamed ""Twitchy"" due to his involuntary facial spasms.
Hope's efforts eventually pay off when Maggie qualifies for the Olympic Games. However, she is shocked to discover that Coach Pavleck's gym is in danger of closing because Pavleck had no money to her name when she died. Upon hearing the news, Hope's father confesses that he was the one who had written the letter, to motivate Hope to do something meaningful with her life. After a heated exchange, Hope gets drunk and ends up having sex with Lance Tucker, leading a heartbroken Ben, who witnessed the act, to break off their relationship.
Maggie succeeds in winning the gold medal and is celebrated as a local hero in Amherst, but announces her intention to begin training with Lance in Los Angeles instead of staying with Hope. When Maggie fails to show up for an autograph signing at a mall, Hope addresses the disappointed crowd and declares that she will always be Amherst's hero. She comes up with a plan to finance Pavleck's gym on her own by selling uniforms and gymnastics lessons to local girls. She then apologizes to Ben and retains him as her assistant coach.
In the epilogue, a caption reveals that Maggie was forced to abandon her gymnastics career after becoming pregnant with Lance's child."
Midnight Special,"In a motel, Roy Tomlin and his friend Lucas watch an AMBER Alert for 8-year-old Alton Meyer and his reported abductor, Roy, while the boy reads on the floor.
At the Ranch, a religious cult in rural Texas, Pastor Calvin Meyer dispatches two of his parishioners to retrieve Alton. He then faces his congregation as the FBI storms their church. NSA communications analyst Paul Sevier asks Calvin how numbers sent via encoded satellite transmissions made their way into his sermons. Calvin explains that Alton speaks in tongues and gave the numbers to Calvin. As Alton's powers grew, his mother abandoned him, and members of the Ranch have been raising him, with Pastor Meyer as his adoptive father. It is also noted in this sequence that Roy is Alton's biological father.
After a violent confrontation with a state trooper, Roy and Lucas seek cover at the home of Elden, a former Ranch member. During the night, an earthquake seems to wake Roy and Lucas. When they break down the door to Alton's room, they find him linked to Elden by blinding beams of light directly from his eyes into Elden's. Roy knocks out Elden and covers up Alton, who is extremely photosensitive. They take Elden's van and continue on toward a location that Alton specified. Members of the Ranch seem to know this location, but the FBI is desperately trying to figure out where the trio are headed.
When they stop at a gas station, Alton seems to destroy a satellite, creating a debris crashing down on them. They drive to Sarah Tomlin's house, and she is overjoyed to be reunited with her son. After they watch the news together, Alton explains that he caused the satellite to crash because the police were using it to track him.
As the fugitives, now including Sarah, continue their trek, Alton appears to be growing sick and weak. He convinces Roy to let him see the daylight, while Lucas and Sarah go ahead to a motel. After witnessing his first sunrise, Alton's eyes begin to glow, and an enormous dome of light surrounds the duo. They reunite with Lucas and Sarah, and Alton is healthy. He explains that seeing the sun helped him realize his true identity. He explains that there is a world ""built on top of"" this one, and that he belongs to it. Roy confirms that he briefly saw this hidden world inside the dome of light.
When they leave the hotel room, they are ambushed by Calvin's trackers from the ranch, who abduct Alton but are soon captured by the police. The boy is taken to a government facility where he insists that he will only talk to Sevier. After Sevier experiences Alton's powers, he helps reunite him with his parents. Having deduced their destination from Calvin's sermons, Sevier warns the fugitives that there is a 5-mile security perimeter around the location, on the Florida panhandle.
Roy barrels through a roadblock, driving inside the perimeter as the Army scrambles to chase them. Alton and Sarah exit the car and run into the woods. Roy and Lucas lead the Army on a wild goose chase while Alton and Sarah reach the edge of a swamp. There, Alton creates a dome of light that engulfs much of Florida and surrounding states; everyone inside it can see the futuristic structures of a parallel world. Eventually, other beings of this world gather around Alton, and the entire dome disappears, taking Alton with it.
Roy and Lucas are arrested. Lucas is interviewed by the FBI. He tells them the story, but they are unsatisfied. Sevier then enters to interview him, with Lucas the only one aware of Sevier's previous involvement. Sarah cuts off her cult traditionalist hair braid in a local gas station. Roy, incarcerated and wearing an electroencephalography device, watches the sunrise as his eyes glow faintly, indicating that he is from the same world as Alton."
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"Eighteen months after the battle between Superman and General Zod in Metropolis,[N 1] Superman has become a controversial figure. Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated in Gotham City as the vigilante Batman for two decades, sees Superman as an existential threat to humanity. After learning of Batman's form of justice, Clark Kent (Superman's civilian identity) seeks to expose him via Daily Planet articles. Wayne learns that Russian weapon trafficker Anatoli Knyazev has been contacting LexCorp mogul Lex Luthor. Meanwhile, Luthor unsuccessfully tries to persuade Senator June Finch to allow him to import kryptonite retrieved from the Indian Ocean following Zod's terraforming attempt, claiming he wants to maintain it as a ""deterrent"" against future Kryptonian threats. He instead makes alternative plans with Finch's subordinate and gains access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian scout ship.
Bruce attends a gala at LexCorp to steal encrypted data from the company's mainframe, where he also encounters with Clark, but has it taken from him by an antiquities dealer named Diana Prince; she eventually returns it to Bruce. While decrypting the drive, Bruce dreams of a post-apocalyptic world, where he leads a group of rebels against a fascist Superman. He is awoken from his vision by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who warns him of Lois Lane's crucial role in the future, and urges him to find ""the others"" before vanishing.[N 2] Wayne later discovers that Luthor is also investigating metahumans. One of them is Prince herself, who is shown in a photo taken during World War I. Wayne admits to Alfred Pennyworth that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.
At a congressional hearing, as Finch questions Superman on the validity of his actions, a bomb goes off and kills everyone present but Superman. Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save them, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite, planning to use it to battle Superman by building a powered exoskeleton, creating a kryptonite grenade launcher, and a kryptonite-tipped spear. Meanwhile, Luthor enters the Kryptonian ship and accesses a vast technology database accumulated from over 100,000 worlds.
Later, Luthor kidnaps Lois and Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother, to bring Superman out of exile. He reveals to him that he manipulated Superman and Batman by fueling their distrust for each other. Luthor demands that Superman kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman fights Superman and eventually subdues him. Before Batman can kill him with the spear, Superman urges Batman to ""save Martha"", whose name is also shared with Bruce's late mother, confusing him long enough for Lois to arrive and explain what Superman meant. Realizing how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the scout ship.
Luthor executes his backup plan, unleashing a genetically engineered monster with DNA from both Zod's body and his own blood.[N 3] Diana Prince arrives unexpectedly; revealing her metahuman nature, she joins forces with Batman and Superman to eliminate the creature. When they are all outmatched, Superman realizes its vulnerability to kryptonite, and retrieves the spear to kill it. In the creature's last moments, it fatally wounds Superman.
Luthor is arrested and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, with various friends and family members including Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince attending for him in Smallville. Martha gives an envelope to Lois, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Bruce expresses his regrets to Diana about how he failed Superman. He reveals to her that he plans to form a team of metahumans, starting with those from Luthor's files, to help protect the world in Superman's absence. After they leave, the dirt atop Clark's coffin levitates."

At the prom, Paris and Bennett share their first kiss while slow-dancing.
At the wedding reception, Gus reads a letter from the ancestry site verifying that he is a descendant of Alexander the Great. Ian, however, realizes that Toula forged the letter to make her father happy. The movie ends with the entire family dropping Paris off at her college dorm in New York."
Everybody Wants Some!!,"In Texas in the fall of 1980, college freshman Jake – a hotshot pitcher in high school – moves into the house he will be sharing with other members of the fictional Southeast Texas Cherokees college baseball team and meets several of his new teammates, including his roommate Billy who has been nicknamed ""Beuter"" because of his Southern accent. He joins Finnegan, Roper, Dale, and Plummer cruising the campus by car, looking to meet female students. Stopping to chat with two women moving into their apartment, upperclassmen Roper – an unapologetic hound-dog – and Finnegan – adopting a false feminist tone – both ""strike out"" with them, but one of them – Beverly – comments that she likes Jake (""the quiet guy in the back seat""); he makes a note of her apartment number.
At a team meeting in the house, the baseball coach introduces the new players, which include Jake, Plummer, Beuter, Brumley – all freshmen – and two transfer students: Jay, recruited for his professional-level pitching, and Willoughby, a bearded philosopher-stoner. The coach cites two rules: no alcohol in the house, and no women upstairs, but the team disregards them, later hosting a drunken party, with several team members taking women up to their bedrooms. Jake tries to take a woman he's met to the downstairs room they'd set aside for sex, but it's occupied, and Beuter refuses to leave their room so Jake can't use it. The next morning, Beuter leaves temporarily for home, concerned that his girlfriend is pregnant.
Later, the team go out drinking and ""cruising chicks"" together, first to the local disco. Finnegan's patter about his ""average penis"", intended to impress women with his lack of ego, is interrupted when Jay's arrogant and racist remarks provoke a fist fight with one of the bartenders, and they are all ejected. Sending Jay home, they change their clothes and instead go to a western-themed bar to end their night on a high note. The next day, at the house, Willoughby shares his marijuana, music, and philosophy with the freshmen, professing his love for Pink Floyd while stating his extreme distaste for Van Halen. That afternoon while walking around with several of his teammates, Jake happens upon Justin, a former teammate from high school who has embraced punk subculture. He invites them to a punk concert, and with Jake's encouragement they go, briefly putting on yet another identity. Jake leaves flowers and a note on Beverly's apartment door that night before he and the rest of the team have a massive frat party at their house.
The next morning, Beverly calls him and they quickly agree to meet. She explains that she's a performing-arts major; Jake answers only that he's a baseball player, based on advice given to him by Finnegan. At the team's first unofficial practice session, Jay upsets the rest of the team by pitching to them aggressively. McReynolds, the team's captain and best player, puts Jay in his place when he hits a home run off of him, which causes Jay to throw a tantrum. The coach unexpectedly shows up and calls Willoughby off the pitcher's mound. It is later revealed that Willoughby is 30 years old, and has been fraudulently transferring to new colleges so he can continue playing ball and enjoying the student lifestyle.
Beverly invites him to come to ""Oz"", a costume party thrown by performing-arts students every Fall. Jake mentions the party to his teammates and tries to tell them they wouldn't enjoy it, but they cajole him into taking them. Although they initially don't fit in well with the ""artsy"" atmosphere and activities, they do their best to hit on the women there and eventually warm up to their surroundings. Finnegan is ridiculed by his friends for adapting his patter to pretend to be into astrology, and Jake takes part in an improvised Alice in Wonderland-themed take on The Dating Game. Jake continues to get close to Beverly and they end up spending the rest of the night together.
The next morning, the semester begins and Jake and Beverly walk together from her apartment, parting to go to their separate classes. Two of the team – who know that Jake didn't return home the night before – razz him for it. He runs into Plummer in his classroom, and they settle in for their first lecture. Their history professor enters and writes the phrase ""Frontiers are where you find them"" on the chalkboard. As their first ever college class officially begins, Plummer and Jake fall asleep."
God's Not Dead 2,"AP History teacher Grace Wesley (Melissa Joan Hart), a devout evangelical Christian, notices that one of her students, Brooke Thawley (Hayley Orrantia), is withdrawn following the recent accidental death of her brother. Involved in little more than her studies, Brooke notices Grace's hope-filled attitude, and asks where Grace finds her optimism. Grace replies ""Jesus"", and Brooke begins to read the Bible for herself. As Grace lectures on Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., Brooke asks whether their peaceful teachings relate to the biblical account of the Sermon on the Mount. Grace responds in the affirmative, and relates parts of scripture to his teachings. One student immediately texts his parents about the class, and the ensuing backlash draws the ire of Principal Kinney (Robin Givens). She reprimands Grace, saying that the teacher's faith clouded her judgment. Grace is subsequently brought before the School Board, who inform her that legal action will be taken against her as she has violated the separation of church and state. Grace's case draws the attention of Tom Endler (Jesse Metcalfe), a young defense attorney who is willing to aid her despite being an unbeliever himself.
After speaking to his friend Josh, Martin Yip, a college student, visits Pastor David Hill (David A. R. White) to ask him several questions about God. Former left-wing blogger Amy Ryan goes to the hospital to check in on her cancer, only to find that it has miraculously vanished. She talks to Michael Tait of the Newsboys, who encourages her, stating that with faith, prayers can be answered. Amy ponders this, and later makes her blog a diary about her adventures with God.
The School Board brings Grace's case before a judge in Little Rock, Arkansas, hoping to secure her termination and strip her of her teaching license unless she issues an apology, which Grace refuses to do. To Brooke's horror, prosecutor Pete Kane (Ray Wise) declares that the lawsuit will ""prove once and for all that God is dead"". His opening argument suggests that the society of the United States will crumble should Grace fail to be found guilty. Endler responds by stating that Grace was simply doing her job, and that the law separating church and state was written by Thomas Jefferson in an effort to protect the church, not persecute it. Kane builds a strong case against Grace by bringing forward witnesses such as Kinney and Brooke's parents, prompting Endler to rethink their defense. Meanwhile Brooke stands in solidarity with her friends against Kinney. The defense is dealt another blow when their key juror, David, becomes ill. Christian apologist J. Warner Wallace is called as an expert witness, arguing that it is illogical to think that the gospel was a conspiracy because despite facing persecution and death, none of the Apostles ever retracted the accounts of seeing the risen Jesus. Kane is floored to learn that Wallace was formerly an atheist who was converted to Christianity.
Amy encourages Brooke to follow her heart, despite what others are making her do. Martin is surprised to find his father in his college dorm. Mr. Yip angrily rebukes Martin for following God despite the family's sacrifices. Martin refuses to deny God, and Mr. Yip disowns him, then leaves. A heartbroken Martin goes to the church, where he finds Brooke. They talk about God, and Martin eventually brings Brooke to God. Later, Brooke sets up a protest to support Grace.
Brooke is allowed as a witness. Kane is able to trick her into admitting that it was Grace and not Brooke who initiated their first conversation about Jesus. As Grace becomes more and more discouraged, Brooke and her friends sing her a song in an attempt to build up her spirits. Martin visits David in the hospital with his friend Paul, and announces that he feels his call is as a pastor in China. Using a tactic to position Grace as a hostile witness, Endler gets the judge to inform the jury not to let their bias or prejudices interfere with their verdict. The jury ultimately finds in favor of Grace, who rejoices along with Brooke and Endler as Kane stands humiliated.
In a post-credits scene, a fully recovered David, hungry after having ice chips for 2 days, returns to church with Paul who offers, ""I'm hungry as well, David. How 'bout I take you for a nice, tuna melt?"" Suddenly, David is then arrested for refusing to turn in his sermons to the government, (shown earlier in the film). Paul and Martin watch as David is taken away. Then, Martin wonders what to do next, and Paul replies ""Same as always, Martin. We pray in faith."" as David is driven off to jail, setting up the events for the sequel: God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness."
Meet the Blacks,"Carl Black and his family are getting out of Chicago. After having stolen a lot of money from a famed criminal drug king, Key Flo (Charlie Murphy), and believing that he will be imprisoned for the next five to six years, Carl Black (Mike Epps) leaves the hustling lifestyle behind for something better. Carl, his new wife Lorena (Zulay Henao), son Carl Jr. (Alex Henderson), daughter Allie Black (Bresha Webb) and cousin Cronut (Lil Duval) pack up and move to Beverly Hills.

Miles Ahead,"Adapted from Sony Classics[5]
In the midst of a prolific career, Miles Davis (Don Cheadle) disappears from public view for a period of five years in the late 1970s. He lives in isolation while dealing with chronic pain from a deteriorating hip, a musical voice inhibited and numbed by drugs and painkillers, and traumatic memories of his past. A music reporter, Dave Braden (Ewan McGregor), forces his way into Davis' house and, over the next couple of days, the two men unwittingly embark on an adventure to recover a stolen tape recording of the musician's most recent compositions.
Davis' mercurial behavior is fueled by memories of his failed 9-year marriage (1958-1967)[6] to the talented and beautiful dancer Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi). During their romance and subsequent marriage, Frances served as Davis' muse. It was during this period that he released several of his signature recordings, including Sketches of Spain (1960) and Someday My Prince Will Come (1961). The marriage was marked by infidelity and abuse, however, and Frances was forced to flee for her own safety as Miles' mental and physical health deteriorated. By the late 1970s, plagued by years of regret and loss, Davis flirts with self-destruction until he once again finds redemption in his music."
The Boss,"The story follows Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy), a titan of industry who is sent to prison for insider trading, denounced by her former lover, Renault (Peter Dinklage), who still holds a heavy grudge towards her for their breakup, after getting a promotion a few years ago. After doing her time, Michelle emerges, ready to rebrand herself as America's latest sweetheart, but not everyone she steamrolled is so quick to forgive and forget. With nowhere to go and no one to scam, Michelle is forced to move in with former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and her young daughter, Rachel (Ella Anderson). Now at her lowest point, Michelle wastes no time in devising a winner-take-all plan to rebuild her empire."
Hardcore Henry,"Waking inside a laboratory on an airship, a man recalls bullies from his childhood. A scientist, Estelle (Haley Bennett), greets him and says his name is Henry, she is his wife, and that he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. After she replaces a missing arm and leg with cybernetic prostheses, mercenaries led by the psychokinetic Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) raid the ship, claiming all of Estelle's research is Akan's corporate property. He kills Estelle's scientists before attempting to murder Henry, but Henry and Estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in Moscow. Estelle is abducted by the mercenaries, who try to kill Henry.
Henry is rescued by a mysterious man, Jimmy (Sharlto Copley), who informs him that his cybernetic implants are running out of power, which will kill him if he can't recharge. Jimmy is killed by corrupt cops bought out by Akan, and Henry is forced to fight his way through both cops and mercenaries, sneaking onto a bus. He is joined by Jimmy — not dead, now an alcoholic, odorous bum — who informs him that one of Akan's associates, Slick Dimitry, has a cybernetic charging pump implanted, which Henry needs to recharge. The two are attacked by a flamethrower-wielding goon. Jimmy is incinerated, but Henry escapes, locating and chasing Dimitry throughout Moscow before capturing him; just as Dimitry promises him information, he is killed by a sniper. Henry removes the pump and receives a call from Jimmy, who directs Henry to a brothel.
Henry meets two more versions of Jimmy — a cocaine-addicted lothario and a shy, awkward geek — who replace his pump. The brothel is attacked by Akan's forces. Henry fights his way through, but encounters Akan, who taunts him with Estelle's kidnapping, revealing she is being transported by an armored convoy. Akan hurls Henry out of the brothel.
Outside, Henry encounters another Jimmy — now a marijuana-obsessed hippie-biker — who transports him to Akan's convoy. Henry finds Estelle - and Akan, who (seemingly) kills him and buries him in the woods.
Jimmy finds and resuscitates Henry, only to be shelled by a tank. After killing the tank crew, fending off a helicopter, and failing to ride a runaway horse, Henry finds another Jimmy — a gruff sniper in a ghillie suit — who leads him to an abandoned hotel, where Jimmy is headquartered in a hidden laboratory. Jimmy and Henry encounter a number of policemen surrounding a girl. They are in the process of forcing her to perform oral sex on one of the cops. Henry kills them all. Here, the real Jimmy — a quadriplegic scientist — reveals his motive for helping Henry: revenge against Akan, who crippled him after his own cyborg super-soldiers failed. He reveals the other Jimmys are dormant clones that he can control, through which he lives a vice-filled life. The clones attack Henry after Jimmy realizes that Henry has been unknowingly broadcasting his location to Akan, with a strike force closing in. Fending off Jimmy, Henry convinces him to help. Henry and the clones of Jimmy — ranging from a punk rocker to a posh WWII Colonel — fight their way out, killing the force by collapsing the laboratory on them.
Jimmy and Henry drive to Akan's headquarters. They fight their way into an elevator, but Jimmy is mortally wounded. Before dying, Jimmy thanks Henry for being the closest thing to a friend he had, and removes a memory blocker, gradually restoring Henry's memories. Henry fights his way to the highest floor, where he is greeted by Akan, revealing an army of cyborg super-soldiers being fed Henry's memories. One such soldier fights Henry, followed by the rest of the army, chasing Henry to the roof.
Henry wipes out the entire army. Akan arrives and severely wounds Henry. Shortly after, Estelle arrives as well. In reality, Estelle was Akan's wife, forming an elaborate ruse to field-test Henry and use his memories to manipulate cyborg soldiers into doing anything to ""rescue"" their ""wife"" — specifically, terrorist attacks and world domination as Akan's loyal slaves. The two leave Henry for dead, leaving in a helicopter. Henry blacks out, but is energized by an emerging memory of his father (Tim Roth) encouraging him to fight back against the childhood bullies seen in the intro. Henry manages to reach Akan, decapitating him with his cybernetic eyestalk. He jumps onto Estelle's helicopter, presenting her Akan's head. Estelle shoots him, but the bullet ricochets off his cybernetic hand and wounds her, leaving her hanging from the helicopter. Estelle pleads with Henry to save her, but Henry slams the door, sending her falling to her death.
Mid-credits, an answering machine message from Jimmy is heard, telling Henry there is ""one more thing"" to do."
Demolition,"Davis is a successful investment banker at a firm founded and run by his father-in-law Phil. His wife, Julia, is driving them when they are struck by another vehicle, killing Julia. Recovering in the hospital, he attempts to purchase some candy from a vending machine which malfunctions. Davis drafts a complaint to the vending machine manufacturer that includes some venting of his personal experiences. This leads to a series of anonymous conversations with a customer service representative, Karen Moreno, in which they end up sharing details of each other's life burdens. Karen appears to be the only one he talks to, though tells his stories in an understated and unemotional style. He brings this same unemotional process to work, which he has returned to much earlier than anyone expected. Davis does tell one other person, a fellow commuter train rider that he realizes that he didn't love Julia because he doesn't feel ""...sad, or pain, or hurt..."".
Davis' changing emotional state causes him to behave erratically. He notices that he is being followed by a green station wagon. The only thing Davis seems to connect with is trying to understand what's inside things, using a small toolkit to dismantle his household appliances, his work computer, a bathroom stall—eventually telling Phil that he has an urge to dismantle a 120-year-old grandfather clock in Phil's office.
Karen follows Davis, talking with him on his commuter train without revealing her identity. She mistakenly leaves some identification, and Davis is sufficiently moved to track her down at home, where she lives with her boyfriend and boss, Carl, and her 15-year old troublemaker son, Chris. When Carl goes on a long business trip, Davis bunks at her house, where they develop a deep platonic friendship. Chris initially dislikes Davis, but later grows not only to like him but to help Davis cope, while Davis becomes his mentor in return.
Davis joins his in-laws in funding a foundation in Julia's name that will award an annual scholarship; during interviews, Davis behaves disrespectfully towards one of the award candidates, and Phil asks him to sign a transfer of his beneficiary rights in Julia's $2.6 million life insurance policy, to the scholarship fund in her name. Davis purchases demolition tools from a hardware store (and, later, a bulldozer) and, with Chris' assistance, destroys his house. When Davis finds an ultrasound of Julia's from the previous year, he is devastated that she failed to inform him.
A climactic night impacts everyone. Davis brings Karen to the party for the scholarship winner, greatly troubling Julia's parents. A young man makes an inappropriate advance on Karen, and she later laughs out loud when he is introduced as the scholarship winner. Davis announces to everyone that Julia had been pregnant and kept it secret. Julia's mother tells him his wife was seeing someone else, and the child was not his and she took her to get an abortion. Returning to Karen's house, Davis finds Carl has returned and is reading the letters Davis wrote to Karen. Carl beats on Davis, which pales compared to the homophobic swarm beating that Chris receives after coming out as gay.
Davis visits his wife's grave and the green station wagon arrives and a man carrying flowers gets out of the car. He is Michael, the driver of the car that killed Julia. Davis forgives Michael and he experiences flashbacks of his wife and him together and he finally cries, bringing closure. He realizes he loved his wife.
Davis has turned a corner. He reconciles with Julia's parents, asking Phil to contribute to refurbishing a carousel – destined for demolition – as a memorial for Julia.
Davis receives a letter from Chris saying that he is recovering from his beating, his mother has left Carl, and Davis must be at Pier 54 at a particular time, which results in Davis witnessing the demolition of some waterfront buildings across the Hudson River. Chris watches Davis through binoculars from a nearby vantage point."
The Invitation,"Will drives with his new girlfriend Kira to the Hollywood Hills home of his ex-wife Eden, who is hosting a dinner party with her new husband David. Will and Eden divorced while trying to cope with their young son Ty's accidental death. Eden met David at a grief support group, and their party will be the first time any of their friends have seen the couple in over two years. On the way, Will strikes and mercy-kills a coyote.
Will and Kira arrive. David and Eden's other dinner guests are Tommy, Tommy's boyfriend Miguel, and friends Ben, Claire, and Gina. Gina mentions that their other friend Choi is running late. Eden introduces Sadie, a girl she and David met while in Mexico who now stays with them.
Throughout the evening, Will wanders in his former home alone and relives memories related to Ty's death, including Eden's attempted suicide. In the kitchen, Will witnesses Eden slap Ben when he makes a joke about her New Age ideas on expelling pain. Eden and David's mysterious friend Pruitt arrives. Will notices that David locked the front door. Will later goes for firewood and spies Eden hide a pill bottle through her bedroom window.
David and Eden tell their guests about a group they joined along with Pruitt and Sadie called ""The Invitation"" to work through grief using spiritual philosophy. David shows everyone a video in which group leader Dr. Joseph comforts a terminally ill woman as she takes her last breaths. David turns away unseen visitors and explains they were strangers looking for a party nearby. The group play a game of ""I Want"" where Sadie kisses Gina, Pruitt confesses to accidentally killing his wife, and Eden kisses Ben. David stops an unsettled Claire from leaving, making Will think David is keeping the guests inside. David changes his mind, and Claire leaves, accompanied by Pruitt, whose car is blocking Claire's. Will watches Pruitt take Claire out of sight to talk to her, and David confronts Will about his suspicion.
During dinner, Will internally reflects on Ty's death. While walking through a hallway, Will sees Sadie make odd faces into a mirror, and they have a strange poolside conversation, during which she sexually propositions him. After rejecting her, Will has a separate discussion with Tommy about the odd atmosphere in the house. Will finally gets a cell phone signal and finds a voice mail from Choi indicating that he was at Eden and David's doorstep before the other guests. Presuming that David and Eden must have done something to Choi, Will publicly confronts the couple about their apparent cult brainwashing. Choi enters unexpectedly, explaining that he was called away by work. Will is embarrassed, but the others assume his residual grief over Ty’s death is causing Will to behave irrationally.
Finding his son's room has been renovated and turned into an office, Will finds a laptop with an ominous video from the founder of The Invitation. David pours drinks for the guests. Will smashes the glasses, fearing they are poisoned. However, Gina drinks hers before Will smashes it. Sadie attacks Will who inadvertently knocks her unconscious in the scuffle. Gina suddenly collapses and dies, revealing that Will was right about the drinks. David, Eden, and Pruitt attack the guests, killing Miguel, Choi, and Ben. Will, Kira, and Tommy flee and hide in the house. Feeling regret over the violence of the killings, Eden is comforted by David, who assures her that what they are doing is the only way they can leave the earth and be freed from their pain. Will retrieves a fireplace poker from Sadie while she lies dying.
Pruitt finds and attacks Will and Kira. Kira retaliates and beats him to death. Eden shoots Will in the shoulder, and herself in the stomach, severely wounding herself. David attacks Tommy, but Tommy stabs David to death. As she dies, Eden asks Will to come to her in her final moments and to take her to the backyard. Kira, Will, and Tommy reunite and head outside with the dying Eden. Tommy goes back inside for Miguel's body. Kira and Will see helicopters flying above. As they watch, Will sees various homes with the same red lantern that David lit earlier in the evening. Will realizes that Los Angeles is erupting in chaos as other cult members throughout the city carry out plans similar to David and Eden's. The two hold hands as the sound of sirens continues."
The Jungle Book,"Mowgli is a ""man cub"" raised by the wolf Raksha and her pack, led by Akela, in an Indian jungle ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera. Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings while Akela disapproves of him using human tricks like building tools instead of learning the ways of the pack.
One day, during the dry season, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. The truce is disrupted when a scarred tiger named Shere Khan arrives detecting Mowgli's scent in the large crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.
En route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous python named Kaa who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being mauled while protecting him from Shere Khan. The vision also warns of the destructive power of the ""red flower"" (fire). Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a large brown sloth bear named Baloo, rescuing an unconscious Mowgli. Baloo and Mowgli bond while retrieving some difficult-to-access honey for Baloo and Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan kills Akela and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.
Bagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is angered that Mowgli has not joined the humans as agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of Indian elephants gathered around a ditch and uses his vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are both impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.
Mowgli is kidnapped by the ""Bandar-log"" (monkeys) who present him to their leader, a gigantopithecus named King Louie. Assuming that all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak him out, but their plan is discovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. King Louie's rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him. Furious that Baloo and Bagheera never told him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan alone.
Mowgli steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire.
In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo, and Bagheera."

Criminal,"When Spanish industrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl arranges for his associate Jan Strook—a hacker known as ""the Dutchman""—to create a wormhole program that would allow the owner to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes, the Dutchman panics and attempts to hand his secret over to the CIA. He makes contact with London-based agent Bill Pope, but although Pope is able to get the Dutchman to a safe house and recover the money to pay him for his services, he is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman.
Desperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's CIA supervisor Quaker Wells contacts Dr. Micah Franks, who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memory patterns of a dead man onto a living one. Keeping Pope's brain stimulated to preserve its knowledge, Franks requests that convict Jerico Stewart be the subject of the procedure, as Stewart's criminal behavior is the result of childhood brain trauma leaving him with an underdeveloped frontal lobe, hindering his emotional development and impulse control, that they can use to ""graft"" Pope's knowledge into Stewart's mind.
While the process initially appears unsuccessful, Jerico is able to escape custody while being transferred after the operation, faking his death and heading to Pope's house, where he ties Pope's wife, Jillian, to her bed and gags her mouth with duct tape, is able to disable the house alarms and delay an investigation of the silent alarm which Jillian manages to activate. As time goes on, he experiences memory flashes of Pope's past, but all he can determine is that the bag of money was hidden behind a shelf of books relating to George Orwell, without identifying where it or the Dutchman are kept.
The CIA becomes increasingly anxious to find the Dutchman when they learn that he is now planning to sell the program to the Russians, believing that the CIA has betrayed him. Fortunately, they are able to find Jerico after he contacts Dr. Franks for medication using Pope's CIA codes, Franks's questioning confirming that Jerico is developing emotions as well as drawing on Pope's experience. As Jerico attempts to retrace the route Pope took to hide the Dutchman, Heimdahl creates a distraction at the airport that draws Quaker's attention, allowing Heimdahl's henchwoman Elsa to try and capture Jerico, killing his CIA guards before Jerico escapes by driving off a bridge.
His leg injured in his escape, Jerico retreats to the Pope house, where he encounters Jillian and explains the situation to her. Although initially concerned, Jillian comes to accept Jerico's story as she sees him interacting with her daughter, Emma, allowing Jerico to stay the night. Jerico forms a bond with the two. The next morning, Jerico realizes through a conversation with Jillian that the bag is hidden in the rare books collection at the University of London where she works. He attempts to retrieve the bag, but he is captured by Heimdahl and Elsa once he has found it. Heimdahl forces him to take them to the Dutchman or he will kill Jillian and Emma.
With the CIA and a Russian strike team now seeking the Dutchman, Jerico—who has recalled that Pope hid the Dutchman in Jillian's office at the university—is able to escape Elsa using an improvised nitro-glycerine bomb, returning to the office to provide a hurried explanation to the Dutchman. The two are caught by Elsa before they can escape, Jerico is shot in the shoulder and after she kills the Dutchman, Jerico knocks her out with a potted cactus before killing her by bashing her head in with a lamp.
Taking the flash drive containing the wormhole program to the airfield where Heimdahl is attempting an escape, Jerico is able to save Jillian and Emma despite Quaker's protests about the danger Heimdahl could pose with the program. As Heimdahl's plane takes off, Jerico reveals to Quaker that he had the Dutchman reprogram the wormhole so that it would target the source of the next transmission, resulting in Heimdahl unwittingly destroying his own plane when he tries to fire a missile at the airfield.
A few months later, Jerico is shown on the beach where Pope and Jillian had their honeymoon, initially unresponsive to anything but automatic reflexes and responses. With all other options exhausted, Quaker and Franks take Jillian and Emma to see him, the sight of Pope's family confirming that some part of Pope exists in Jerico when he responds with a nose-tap that was Pope and Jillian's way of saying ""I love you"" in private. Witnessing this, Quaker reflects that he will offer Jerico a job."
Green Room,"Pat, Sam, Reece and Tiger are members of a punk band, the Ain't Rights, travelling through the Pacific Northwest. After their gig is cancelled, local radio host Tad arranges a show through his cousin, Daniel, at a neo-Nazi skinhead bar in the woods outside Portland.
After the show, Pat returns to the green room to retrieve Sam's phone and sees the body of a girl, Emily, who has been stabbed to death by a neo-Nazi . Pat saw a woman named Amber witnessing the death of her best friend Emily at the hands of the neo-Nazi. He calls the police, but bar employees Gabe and Big Justin confiscate the band's phones and hold them hostage in the green room. Gabe pays a skinhead to stab another to create a cover story for the police who respond to the call. He consults with bar owner and skinhead leader Darcy, who decides to kill the band to eliminate witnesses.
The band overpowers Big Justin and hold him hostage, taking a boxcutter from his pocket and his gun. They negotitate through the door with Darcy, who asks them to surrender the gun. Pat agrees, but as he opens the door, Amber realizes it's a trap and shouts. Darcy and his men slash at Pat's arm with machetes until he drops the gun, but he manages to close the door. Big Justin attacks the band, but Reece chokes him into unconsciousness. When Big Justin surprises Reece by awaking again, Reece strangles Big Justin and Amber kills him with a box cutter.
Searching for a way out, the band discover an underground drug lab, but the only exit is locked from the outside. Arming themselves with improvised weapons, they exit the green room into the empty club, but are attacked by a dog, which kills Tiger. Amber and Pat drive the dog away with microphone feedback. Reece tries to flee through a window, but a skinhead hacks him to death. Pat, Amber, and Sam retreat to the green room.
Darcy sends Daniel into the club to kill the band, who Darcy claims murdered Emily. Amber reveals to Daniel that it was really Werm who murdered her after discovering he and his girlfriend Emily planned to leave the skinheads. Daniel joins forces with Pat, Amber, and Sam and agrees to help them escape and leads the band into the club. Suddenly, a bartender breaks into the club and shoots Daniel to death. The group executes the bartender and takes his shotgun, unfortunately, Sam is killed by a dog, and Darcy's men wound Amber, who scrambles back to the green room with Pat.
Darcy sends skinheads Jonathan and Kyle after Pat and Amber, and leaves with the bodies, planning to stage their deaths to appear as if they were killed trespassing. Pat lures Jonathan into the drug lab while Kyle remains in the green room and is attacked and killed by Amber with her own boxcutter. As Pat fights Jonathan, Amber sneaks up and shoots him. Gabe enters the green room to find his companions dead and surrenders to Pat and Amber. Holding Gabe at gunpoint, they trek through the woods.
When Pat hears Darcy and his men staging the crime scene, he and Amber go after them. Before that, Pat orders Gabe to go to a farm and call the police. Gabe has no choice but to call the police in a nearby farm. Pat and Amber manages to kill skinheads Clark and Alan. Darcy attempts to pull a revolver from his jacket but is executed by Pat and Amber.
Their ammunition and energy spent; Pat and Amber sit on the side of the road and wait for the police at the end of the film."
The Huntsman: Winter's War,"Evil sorceress Queen Ravenna's powers allow her to know that her younger sister Freya, whose powers have not emerged, is not only engaged in an illicit affair with nobleman Andrew, but is also pregnant with his child. Sometime after Freya gives birth to a baby girl, Freya discovers that Andrew murdered their child and, in a grief-fueled rage, Freya kills him with her sudden emergence of ice powers.
Freya abandons the kingdom and builds herself a new kingdom. Ruling as the Ice Queen, Freya orders children to be abducted so they can be trained to avoid the pain of love (as she suffered), and to be an army of fearsome huntsmen to conquer for her. Despite the training, two of her best huntsmen, Eric and Sara, grow up and fall in love, secretly marry, and plan to escape together. Freya discovers their secret and confronts them, creates a massive ice wall to separate them, then casts Eric out of her kingdom after first forcing him to watch as Sara is killed by their fellow huntsmen.
Seven years later, and after Ravenna's death, Queen Snow White falls ill after hearing Ravenna's Magic Mirror calling her. Because of its dark magic, she ordered it to be taken to Sanctuary, the magical place that sheltered Snow White during the events leading to Ravenna's death, so the mirror's magic could forever be contained. Snow White's husband, William, informs Eric that the soldiers tasked with carrying the Mirror went missing while en route to the Sanctuary. Eric realizes that he is being watched by Freya through magic. Knowing the magic of the mirror can make Freya even stronger, Eric agrees to investigate, but reluctantly allows Snow White's dwarf ally Nion and his half-brother Gryff to come along.
While travelling to the last known location of the soldiers, the trio are attacked by a group of Freya's huntsmen, but are rescued by Sara. Sara reveals that she was imprisoned by Freya the entire time, only to escape recently. While Eric was made to see Sara die she was made to see him running away rather than fighting to help her. Eric convinces her that Freya conjured these visions, and eventually has Sara to join with him and the dwarves to thwart Freya. The quartet is ensnared in a trap set by she-dwarves Bromwyn and Doreena. They convince the she-dwarves to help them find the Mirror, and the two lead them to the goblins that stole the mirror from Snow White's soldiers. The party fight off the goblins and retrieve the Mirror.
As the group nears the Sanctuary with the Mirror, they are ambushed by Freya and her huntsmen. Freya reveals Sara has been loyal to her all along, and that Sara was using her companions to find the Mirror. In the ensuing chaos, Nion and Doreena are turned into ice statues, and Sara shoots an arrow into Eric's chest on Freya's order, killing him. Freya departs with the Magic Mirror, but she is unaware that Sara intentionally missed so that Eric could live. Back in her palace, Freya recites the iconic verse associated with the Mirror, resurrecting Ravenna, who became one with the Mirror when Snow White vanquished her. Boasting a new suite of powers thanks to the Mirror, Ravenna usurps Freya's rule by coordinating Freya's huntsmen and army to reclaim the kingdoms Snow White liberated.
Eric infiltrates the ice palace with help of Gryff and Bromwyn. He attempts to assassinate Freya, but is stopped by Ravenna. When Freya realizes that Sara didn't actually kill Eric, she reluctantly sentences them both to death because of Ravenna's manipulation. However, Eric is able to convince a few huntsmen to rebel, claiming the love of brethren. Ravenna begins to kill the huntsmen. Freya, realizing that she regards the huntsmen as her ""children"", protects them with an ice wall, separating the huntsmen from the sisters. As Eric, Sara and the rebelling huntsmen climb over the wall to fight Ravenna and Freya, the two sisters argue over the icy kingdom. Freya forces Ravenna (who as the mirror spirit must answer her summoner's questions truthfully) to reveal that she ultimately caused the death of Freya's child so she could remain the fairest of them all, so Freya finally turns against her sister. Freya is impaled by Ravenna, but with her remaining strength Freya freezes the Magic Mirror. Eric shatters the Mirror, thus destroying Ravenna. As Freya dies from her wounds, she smiles at the sight of a vision of her old loving self, and gladly witnesses Eric and Sara together.
With Freya's death, those who had been imprisoned by Freya's magic are set free, including Nion and Doreena, while a mysterious golden bird flies overhead. Eric, Sara and the huntsmen look forward to a new future while the dwarves pair off romantically and Eric and Sara share a kiss finally happy to have a life together for the first time in years.
In a post-credits scene, Snow White in a red dress with a crown on her head is seen from behind. The aforementioned bird flies and lands on the balcony next to her."
Elvis & Nixon,"On the morning of December 21, 1970, actor-singer Elvis Presley shows up to the White House and requests an urgent meeting with President Richard Nixon. Presley opposes the drug culture, the hippie movement, SDS, and Black Panthers; he wants Nixon to swear him in as an undercover agent in the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.[5][6] Two of Nixon's senior aides, Dwight Chapin and Egil Krogh, set up a meeting between the two men. At first, Nixon is annoyed by what he sees as a PR stunt, but over the course of the meeting finds that they have much in common: they are both self-made men who came from humble beginnings and worked hard for their success, and they both feel unappreciated by an American culture they no longer understand. They part on good terms, and pose together for an iconic photograph."
Keanu,"Smoke and Oil Dresden (Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key), a pair of assassins known as the ""Allentown Brothers"", enter a drug-processing facility run by a Mexican drug cartel and kill everyone inside, including the boss King Diaz. The pair take Diaz's cat Iglesias, but when they are momentarily distracted by policemen arriving, the cat escapes. Meanwhile, Rell (also played by Peele) has just been dumped by his girlfriend; he finds the cat on his doorstep, takes an immediate liking to it, and names it Keanu. Rell's cousin Clarence (also played by Key) comes over to cheer him up and meets Keanu as well.
Two weeks later, Clarence's wife, Hannah (Nia Long), and daughter go out of town with the husband and daughter of a family friend, leaving Clarence alone. Rell, who is much happier after taking care of Keanu, takes Clarence out to see a Liam Neeson movie, telling him he needs to loosen up and just be himself. When the two return to Rell's house, they find the place has been ransacked and Keanu is missing. A distraught Rell drags Clarence along to the next-door residence of his weed dealer Hulka (Will Forte), who reluctantly reveals that the 17th St. Blips, a local gang, may have raided Rell's house instead of his. Hulka directs them to a downtown strip club; Rell and Clarence go there, where Rell convinces Clarence to adopt a ""gangsta"" persona in order to infiltrate the gang, calling themselves ""Tectonic"" and ""Shark Tank"". The two meet Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish), who initially is skeptical of them, but nonetheless takes them to meet the gang's leader Cheddar (Method Man), who mistakes them for the Allentown Boys. Cheddar has Keanu (having renamed him New Jack and fitted him with a do-rag), and they ask for the cat. He will only return the cat to them if they come along as expert advisors for the Blips on a run to sell a new drug called ""Holy Shit""; both reluctantly agree.
After taking their team through a team-building exercise, Rell, Clarence, Hi-C, and three other gang members drive to their delivery spot. While Clarence stays behind and introduces the young men to the music of George Michael (whom he describes as if he were black, to overcome their skepticism), Rell and Hi-C go to make the sale. The buyer turns out to be Anna Faris, who is partying with two friends. Faris invites them to play Truth or Dare, and dares Hi-C to shoot Rell. When Hi-C refuses, a fight ensues in which Faris and her two guests are both shot and killed by Hi-C, frightening Rell. At the strip club after the run, Clarence accidentally smokes some Holy Shit, and experiences a drug trip in which he appears in the music video for Faith by George Michael, and Keanu speaks to him in the voice of Keanu Reeves. Rell begins to worry about his cousin and convinces him to just take Keanu and leave. The two do so, but are abducted on their way to their car by the actual Allentown Boys.
Rell and Clarence are tied to chairs and as the Allentown Boys prepare to torture them, Keanu claws through Rell's ropes, allowing him to free himself and Clarence, and they grab the Allentown Boys' guns. The Allentown boys continue to approach them, but Clarence and Rell completely unload the guns into them, seemingly killing them. On their way out of the building searching for Keanu, Rell and Clarence run into the Blips; Cheddar has discovered their real identities from a kidnapped Hulka, and forces them to come along to a meeting with the Mexican drug cartel at its mansion in the morning. At the meeting, the Blips meet with King Diaz's cousin Bacon (Luis Guzmán), offering Clarence and Rell as the supposed Allentown Boys, but when Bacon also demands ""Iglesias"", Cheddar refuses and starts a gunfight between the two gangs. Clarence and Rell realize that the team-building exercise the two took the gang through has improved their communication; they pick up guns and shoot their way out of the mansion in pursuit of Bacon, who has taken Keanu, only for Rell to be shot in the leg and Clarence shot in the hand.
Rell – who never learned to drive – hijacks Bacon's escape car with Bacon and Keanu in the back; Clarence gives chase in a car that belongs to Bacon's son. The chase ends at Clarence's house, where Rell crashes into the front yard, sending Bacon flying through where the windshield of the car would have been, had it not been removed in the chase. Bacon gets up and attempts to shoot Rell, but Clarence runs him over. Bacon gets up again, but is shot and killed by Cheddar and the Blips. The Blips threaten Rell and Clarence, but Hi-C – secretly a police officer – breaks her cover and forces the Blips to drop their guns. When Cheddar attempts to shoot her, she kills him. The police arrive, and Hi-C reveals that Faris and her party guests were in on the whole operation and are all still alive, but Rell and Clarence will still have to go to jail for the activities they've taken part in, including the killing of the Allentown Boys. She promises to testify for leniency and agrees to go on a date with Rell after they get out of jail.
Six months later, Rell and Clarence have only three weeks left on their jail sentences, but have commanded respect among the inmates – including the remaining Blips – for killing the Allentown Boys. Hi-C, who has been taking care of Keanu, speaks with Rell through a visitation phone, where she reveals that she's just been to the veterinarian and discovered that Keanu has a rare disease: he will remain a kitten permanently.
In a post-credits scene, the Allentown Boys are revealed to have survived the shooting and get back into their car."
Mother's Day,"As Mother's Day draws close, a group of seemingly unconnected people in Atlanta come to terms with the relationships they have with their mothers. Sandy (Jennifer Aniston) is a divorced mother of two boys whose ex-husband has recently remarried a younger woman named Tina (Shay Mitchell). Miranda (Julia Roberts) is an accomplished writer who gave up her only child, Kristin (Britt Robertson), for adoption at birth. But as a grown-up Kristin prepares herself for marriage, she begins to contemplate the missing part in her life and is encouraged by her friend, Jesse (Kate Hudson), to go out and find her mother. Meanwhile, Jesse and her sister Gabi, who never see their mother, are surprised by their parents when they come to visit and must come to terms with their failing relationship."
Ratchet & Clank,"Above planet Tenemule in the Solana Galaxy, Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti) stands poised with his fellow Blarg aboard the Deplanetizer, a space station with the power to destroy entire planets. The Blarg fire the Deplanetizer at Tenemule, completely destroying it.
On planet Veldin, a young spaceship mechanic named Ratchet (James Arnold Taylor) learns of the destruction of Tenemule along with three other planets, and the peacekeeping Galactic Rangers are being dispatched to address the situation. He also learns that their leader, the egocentric Captain Qwark (Jim Ward), plans to visit Veldin in search of a new recruit to the team. To the reluctance of his mentor Grimroth ""Grim"" Razz (John Goodman), Ratchet attempts to join, only to be rejected by Qwark moments later.
In a warbot factory on the Blarg homeworld, Quartu, a diminutive yet intelligent defective robot is created. Having acquired Drek's plans, he escapes Drek's lieutenant Victor Von Ion (Sylvester Stallone) and attempts to travel to the Rangers' headquarters on planet Kerwan to warn them. The defect crash-lands on Veldin, where Ratchet takes him in and names him Clank (David Kaye). Learning of Drek's plot, Ratchet flies Clank to Kerwan, where the two are forced to help save the Galactic Rangers, who are under attack by the Blarg. Victor barely escapes. Under pressure from reporters, Qwark makes Ratchet and Clank honorary Rangers. Meanwhile, Drek's devious chief scientist Dr. Nefarious (Armin Shimerman) gives him the idea of destroying the Rangers from within by turning Qwark against them. Ratchet joins fellow Galactic Rangers, Brax Lectrus (Vincent Tong) and Cora Veralux (Bella Thorne) in the field while Clank is assigned to the Rangers' support team with Elaris (Rosario Dawson), who is routinely ignored by Qwark. Studying the destroyed planets, Elaris and Clank discover that the Blarg have been extracting portions containing famous landmarks from each.
After briefing, the Rangers infiltrate the warbot factory on Quartu. Ratchet, Clank and Cora discover that the Blarg are planning to build a replacement homeworld from the other worlds' fragments, as the surface of Quartu was rendered uninhabitable by years of pollution, forcing the Blarg to live underground. Meanwhile Qwark encounters Drek, who offers to help boost his image in spite of Ratchet's popularity. Qwark accepts so long as Drek agrees never to hurt his Rangers. The rangers capture Zed (Andrew Cownden), one of Drek's main assistants, who tells them the next target is Cora's homeworld of Novalis.
As the Rangers assault the Deplanetizer, Drek forces Qwark to deactivate the Rangers' weapons. Victor raids the Rangers' starship, the Phoenix, and goes after Clank, who smartly uses water to rust him up. Ratchet manages to successfully board the station, but Drek captures him and the Rangers can only watch as Novalis is destroyed. Upon being captured, Ratchet learns Qwark is a traitor before being jettisoned from Drek's ship.
Appalled, Qwark goes to confront Drek. However, he is also met by Dr. Nefarious whom Qwark thought was killed during a prison escape. After he chides Qwark for selling out the Rangers, Dr. Nefarious betrays Drek by using a ""Sheepinator"" to turn him into a sheep and ejects him to New Quartu in an escape pod and takes control of the Deplanetizer for his own intentions.
Ratchet exiles himself back to Veldin, guilt-ridden and believing himself responsible for the Rangers' failure, but Clank and the Rangers find him and convince him to return. With Novalis gone, the Deplanetizer's next and last target is planet Umbris, which has an unstable core that would annihilate the other planets in the entire galaxy if it were destroyed. Zed tells the group that Nefarious is the one behind all this.
They assault the Deplanetizer and Ratchet is forced to battle Qwark. After a long battle Ratchet pleads for Qwark to stop, asking him if the galaxy's destruction is really what he he wants to be remembered for since everything including them would be destroyed if Umbris was. Qwark, now realizing what he has done, finally does so and apologizes to Ratchet. They confront Dr. Nefarious, who reveals that he was once a Ranger himself before he left due to Qwark's mistreatment. Dr. Nefarious successfully activates the Deplanetizer and escapes, but not before the other Rangers are able to move it off target from Umbris. The Deplanetizer instead fires on New Quartu, destroying the composite planet and killing Drek, still being a sheep who crash landed on it moments prior. Ratchet, Clank and Qwark barely escape as the now-vulnerable station falls toward Umbris, while Dr. Nefarious is seemingly disintegrated as the result of a failed attempt to use one of his own weapons (the RYNO) on Qwark.
Having thwarted Dr. Nefarious, the other Rangers narrowly escape the Deplanetizer and return to a hero's welcome on Kerwan, with the now-demoted Private Qwark shamelessly attempting to promote his apologetic autobiography about the crisis. Ratchet and Clank reunite on Veldin, with Ratchet promising that he will rejoin the Rangers when he is needed.
In a mid-credits scene, Dr. Nefarious is found amongst the Deplanetizer's wreckage on Umbris, and forcibly converted by one of his drones into his iconic robot form.
In the post-credits, the Plumber appears and scolds the audience that they have still not left the movie yet."
Captain America: Civil War,"In 1991, the brainwashed super-soldier James ""Bucky"" Barnes is dispatched from a Hydra base in Siberia to intercept an automobile carrying a case of super-soldier serum. In the present day, approximately one year after Ultron's defeat in the nation of Sokovia at the hands of the Avengers,[N 1] Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Sam Wilson, and Wanda Maximoff stop Brock Rumlow from stealing a biological weapon from a lab in Lagos. Rumlow blows himself up, hoping to kill Rogers. When Maximoff throws the explosion into the sky with telekinesis, it damages a nearby building, killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers.
U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King T'Chaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom T'Chaka's son, T'Challa, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes' whereabouts and the authorities' intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended.
Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to make Barnes obey him. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed ""Winter Soldiers"" are kept in cryogenic stasis. Unwilling to wait for authorization to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, and recruit Maximoff, Clint Barton, and Scott Lang to their cause. With Ross's permission, Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, T'Challa, James Rhodes, Vision, and Peter Parker to capture the renegades. Stark's team intercepts Rogers' group at Leipzig/Halle Airport, where they fight until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape. The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, while Rhodes is partially paralyzed after being inadvertently shot down by Vision, and Romanoff goes into exile.
Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable Stark's armor and departs with Barnes, leaving his shield behind. Satisfied that he has avenged his family's deaths in Sokovia from the Avengers' actions by successfully fracturing them, Zemo attempts suicide, but he is stopped by T'Challa and taken to the authorities.
In the aftermath, Stark provides Rhodes with exoskeletal leg braces that allow him to walk again, while Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft. In a mid-credits scene, Barnes, granted asylum in Wakanda, chooses to return to cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing is found. In a post-credits scene, Parker tests a new gadget built by Stark."
Money Monster,"Flamboyant television financial expert Lee Gates is in the midst of the latest edition of his show, Money Monster. Less than 24 hours earlier, IBIS Clear Capital's stock inexplicably cratered, apparently due to a glitch in a trading algorithm, costing investors $800 million. Lee planned to have IBIS CEO Walt Camby appear for an interview about the crash, but Camby unexpectedly left for a business trip to Geneva.
Midway through the show, a deliveryman wanders onto the set, pulls a gun and takes Lee hostage, forcing him to put on a vest laden with explosives. He is Kyle Budwell, who invested $60,000—his entire life savings—in IBIS after Lee endorsed the company on the show. Kyle was wiped out along with the other investors. Unless he gets some answers, he will blow up Lee before killing himself. Once police are notified, they discover that the receiver to the bomb's vest is located over Lee's kidney. The only way to destroy the receiver—and with it, Kyle's leverage—is to shoot Lee and hope he survives.
With the help of longtime director Patty Fenn, Lee tries to calm Kyle and find Camby for him, though Kyle is not satisfied when both Lee and IBIS chief communications officer Diane Lester offer to compensate him for his financial loss. He also is not satisfied by Diane's insistence that the algorithm is to blame. Diane is not satisfied by her own explanation, either, and defies colleagues to contact a programmer who created the algorithm, Won Joon. Reached in Seoul, Joon insists that an algorithm could not take such a large, lopsided position unless someone meddled with it.
Lee appeals to his TV viewers for help, seeking to recoup the lost investment, but is dejected by their response. New York City police find Kyle's pregnant girlfriend Molly and allow her to talk to Kyle through a video feed. When she learns that he lost everything, she viciously berates him before the police cut the feed. Lee, seemingly taking pity on Kyle, agrees to help his captor discover what went wrong.
Once Camby finally returns, Diane flips through his passport, discovering that he did not go to Geneva but to Johannesburg. With this clue, along with messages from Camby's phone, Patty and the Money Monster team contact a group of Icelandic hackers to seek the truth. After a police sniper takes a shot at Lee and misses, he and Kyle resolve to corner Camby at Federal Hall National Memorial, where Camby is headed according to Diane. They head out with one of the network's cameramen, Lenny, plus the police and a mob of fans and jeerers alike. Kyle accidentally shoots and wounds producer Ron Sprecher when Ron throws Lee a new earpiece. Kyle and Lee finally confront Camby with video evidence obtained by the hackers.
It turns out that Camby bribed a South African miners' union, planning to have IBIS make an $800 million investment in a platinum mine while the union was on strike. The strike lowered the mine's owners stock, allowing Camby to buy it at a low price. If Camby's plan had succeeded, IBIS would have generated a multibillion-dollar profit when work resumed at the mine and the stock of the mine's owner rose again. The gambit backfired when the union stayed on the picket line. Camby attempted to bribe the union leader, Moshe Mambo, in order to stop the strike, but Mambo refused and continued the strike, causing IBIS' stock to sink under the weight of its position in the flailing company.
Despite the evidence, Camby refuses to admit his swindle until Kyle takes the explosive vest off Lee and puts it on him. Camby admits to his wrongdoing to Kyle on live camera. Satisfied with the outcome, Kyle throws the detonator away, then much to Lee's dismay gets fatally shot by the police. In the aftermath, the SEC announces that IBIS will be put under investigation, while Camby is charged with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act."
The Darkness,"Peter and Bronny Taylor go on a vacation to the Grand Canyon in Arizona with Stephanie, their teenage daughter, and Mikey, their adolescent autistic son. Mikey discovers a small Kiva cavern, where he finds black rocks with symbols on them. He takes the rocks, keeping a secret untold.
When the Taylors return home, strange things begin to happen. Bronny finds that the kitchen taps keep turning on, and Stephanie sees handprints on a steamy mirror, both of which Mikey blames on “Jenny”. After Stephanie gets home from school, she vomits into a container and puts it under her bed. Bronny catches her, and she and Peter learn that Stephanie has been throwing up for a while; there are many such containers under her bed. They take Stephanie to a hospital for help, leaving Mikey at Bronny's mother's house. Bronny's mother finds Mikey trying to kill her cat, much to Peter’s disbelief.
At home, Bronny searches online for answers to the strange activity and learns about the Anasazi Indians, who have believed that demons were bound to rocks hidden in underground caves. If the rocks are taken, the demons take the shape of a crow, snake, coyote, wolf, and buffalo. The family has already had encounters with a crow and a snake. The demons connect to young children who are dragged into their world, triggering an event known as 'The Darkness'. The only way they can be banished is if the rocks are returned to where they were found by someone who is not afraid.
Bronny finds a wall on fire in Mikey's room, but Peter rules out the possibility of ghosts. They later find Mikey covered in black marks from the fire, with blood pouring from his mouth. Later that night, Bronny has a nightmare of a wolf. Depressed, she starts drinking. In Mikey's room, the fire-damaged part of the wall is revealed to be a portal. Stephanie begins being choked by handprints appearing all over her wall and body. In the tree house, Peter sees a coyote, and then sees the shadow of a demon in Stephanie's window. The force stops choking Stephanie as Peter rushes in. Peter then breaks down Mikey's bathroom door, and finds him with marks all over the walls and ceiling.
Peter calls a number given to him by his boss. It is a woman named Teresa, who is said to perform spiritual healings. Teresa comes over with her granddaughter named Gloria, who acts as a translator. As they cleanse the house, Teresa and Gloria go into Mikey's room, and note that this is where the real evil lives. They recite a chant as Mikey tries to enter the portal.
When they realize Mikey's gone, the family races upstairs. Peter sees Mikey walking into the portal with the demons. He finds the stones and follows Mikey into the portal, but can't set the stones down due to his fear. He offers to swap places with Mikey but Mikey ends the event of 'The Darkness' by picking the stones up and putting them back down, saying that he is not afraid. The demons have been completely banished, and Peter and Mikey jump out of the portal together. It disappears, and Gloria declares that the house is clean of evil energy as Peter and his family reunite together."
Love & Friendship,"In the 1790s, the recently widowed and relatively young Lady Susan Vernon seeks a suitably wealthy match for her only daughter, Frederica, and a similarly wealthy husband for herself, in order to renew the state of her fortunes. After being unceremoniously turned out of the Manwaring estate due to her dalliance with the married Lord Manwaring (pronounced ""Mannering""), she and her companion Mrs. Cross head to Churchill, the country home of her brother-in-law, Charles Vernon and his wife, Catherine Vernon (née DeCourcy). Lady Susan frankly discusses her plans during visits to her trusted friend, Mrs. Johnson.
Catherine and her brother, Reginald DeCourcy, are aware of Lady Susan's long-standing reputation as a determined and accomplished flirt. But under the influence of the amiable but dull Charles, Reginald agrees to keep an open mind, and soon finds himself enchanted with Lady Susan. When Reginald's father, Sir Reginald DeCourcy, catches wind of this, he travels to Churchill to warn Reginald against marrying Lady Susan lest the family name be sullied. But Reginald says their relationship is not romantic. However, it is not long before he and Lady Susan have reached an understanding.
Meanwhile, Lady Susan's daughter, Frederica, who has been attending a boarding school which her mother cannot afford, runs away and is then expelled. Frederica arrives at Churchill and, shortly thereafter, is followed by Sir James Martin, a man who is both very wealthy and very foolish. For example, upon arrival at Churchill, he explains that he struggled to find the estate as he had been looking for ""church hill"", a church and/or a hill. Later, he mentions the ""Twelve Commandments"" and when told there are only ten, he wonders which two should be disregarded.
While in London, Lady Susan's relationship with Lord Manwaring suddenly explodes into scandal. Lady Manwaring discovers that the illicit lovers are meeting in private and appeals to her guardian, Mr Johnson, to confront them. He refuses, and Reginald arrives with a letter from Lady Susan to Mrs Johnson, which Lady Manwaring snatches and reads. The contents reveal Lady Susan asking her friend Mrs Johnson to keep Reginald busy while she (Lady Susan) is with Lord Manwaring. Narrowly missing a departing Lord Manwaring, Reginald confronts an unruffled Lady Susan, who tells him that they cannot be married after all.
After returning to his sister's home, Reginald DeCourcy falls in love with Frederica, and the two are married. It then transpires that Lady Susan has married Sir James, who confides to Mrs. Johnson his joy at the prospect of becoming a father, having been informed on the day after his marriage that his new wife was with child. Sir James goes on to speak fondly of his newfound friend and long-term house-guest, Lord Manwaring, who was invited to stay by Lady Susan, and with whom he shares a love of hunting. Lord Manwaring, says Sir James, is someone who always enjoys hunting game of whatever merit, both ""large and small""."
The Angry Birds Movie,"On Bird Island, an island inhabited by happy flightless birds, the reclusive Red is sentenced to an anger management class after his temper causes a ""premature hatching"" of a customer's egg. Resentful, Red avoids getting to know his classmates Chuck, Bomb, and Terence, as well as the class's instructor Matilda. One day, a boat docks at the island's shore containing green-colored pigs, and their captain Leonard, who claim to be peaceful explorers bringing offerings of friendship. The pigs are accepted on the island and introduce the birds to innovative technologies such as slingshots and helium balloons.
More pigs arrive and seemingly adjust to the birds' society, but Red soon becomes suspicious of their motives, as they slowly overwhelm the island. He recruits Chuck and Bomb to help him find Mighty Eagle, a giant bald eagle said to be the protector of the island, and the only bird that can fly, but who has not been seen for many years. They find Mighty Eagle on top of Bird Mountain, but he is now overweight, self-absorbed, and largely in retirement. Looking through the Mighty Eagle's binoculars, Red's group sees the pigs planting explosives around the island while the birds, probably unaware the other three are gone, are at a rave party. They realize the party was actually a cover for their plan to steal the birds' eggs. Red, Bomb, and Chuck attempt to warn the other birds and stop the pigs, but they arrive too late as the pigs escape with the eggs and their explosives destroy the village. When the birds realize what happened, they apologize to Red for not believing him, and the forgiving Red rallies them to let their anger loose and retrieve their eggs.
The birds construct a boat and sail to Piggy Island, where they find the pigs living in a walled city and Leonard, who is actually revealed to be King Mudbeard, the king of Piggy Island. Deducing the eggs are most likely in the castle at the center of the city, the birds attack and defeat the pigs by firing themselves over the walls using their gifted giant slingshot. However, when Terence attempts to launch himself into the city, he accidentally snaps the slingshot in half after pulling himself too far back. Meanwhile, Red, Chuck, and Bomb make it to the castle and find the eggs in a boiler room, where the pigs plan to cook and eat them. Mighty Eagle arrives, having watched these events through his binoculars and had a change of heart, and carries the eggs out of the castle. While the birds escape, one egg falls out and rolls back into the castle. While battling Leonard, Red learns to control his anger and distracts him long enough to retrieve the egg; the pot the pigs planned on boiling the eggs in collapses and shields Red as the pigs' reserve of explosives blows up and destroy Piggy Island. Red reunites with the other birds as the rescued egg hatches, revealing three little blue birds, and is declared a hero. He, Chuck, and Bomb are approached by Mighty Eagle, who claims that his laziness was only a ruse so the birds could find faith in themselves. Returning to Bird Island, the birds rebuild Red's house, which was destroyed by the pigs, and moved it to the middle of their village. All of the birds that have hatched sing a song to Red to thank him and enshrine him as a legendary hero, and Red lets Chuck and Bomb move in with him.
During the end credits, the pigs are revealed to survive Piggy Island's destruction, as King Mudbeard begins to make a new plan to steal the eggs, but soon does the break dance. In a mid-credits scene, the three blue birds use the rebuilt slingshot to launch themselves out to sea."
Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,"Two years after the events of the first film, Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) are trying to sell their home with the arrival of another baby. A couple, Eric (Sam Richardson) and Jessica Baiers (Abbi Jacobson) are looking to buy; the realtor (Liz Cackowski) tells Mac and Kelly that their house is in escrow for 30 days, so the buyers will check in every now and then to make sure everything is okay. Meanwhile, Mac's friend, Jimmy (Ike Barinholtz), and his once-again wife Paula (Carla Gallo) are also expecting a baby. At the Phi Lambda sorority, Shelby (Chloë Grace Moretz), a freshman, learns that sororities are not allowed to host parties, and can only attend frat parties. Shelby goes to a frat party and meets two other freshmen, Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein). They are disgusted by the sexist and perverse nature of the party and leave. Bonding over their dissatisfaction, the trio decides to set up a new sorority, Kappa Nu, to host their own parties.
Meanwhile, Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) is at a dinner with his old frat brothers Pete (Dave Franco), Scoonie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and Garf (Jerrod Carmichael). Since graduating, they had been successful in their own jobs: Pete is working as an architect and has come out of the closet, Scoonie has launched his own app, and Garf is now a cop. Due to the events from the first film, Teddy now has a criminal record and cannot get a worthwhile job to support himself (having been fired from his job as a shirt model). Since that time, he had continued blaming the Radners' for both the record and the loss of career opportunities. Pete's boyfriend Darren (John Early) then proposes to him, and Pete accepts, leading Pete to ask Teddy to move out, which later escalates into an argument between the two. The following day, the girls try to rent the adjacent house to the Radners', but do not have enough money to pay for it. Teddy, finding an opportunity where he can be valued, offers to help them and suggests a successful way to afford the rent. That night, they throw their first party. Horrified to learn they are a sorority, Mac and Kelly ask Shelby to keep the noise down. Mac and Kelly report them to Dean Gladstone (Lisa Kudrow), but she is unable to intervene since they are an independent sorority and she fears that shutting it down may lead to a public relations nightmare regarding sexism.
The couple contact Shelby's father (Kelsey Grammer), but he fails to control the situation. Feeling outraged, the girls constantly haze the Radners. Mac, Kelly, Jimmy, and Paula retaliate by causing a bed bug infestation in the house, resulting in a fumigation just in time for the Baier's visit. The girls plan to raise money by selling weed at the school's tailgate and eliminating all the other competition by getting all the other weed dealers on campus arrested. Teddy strongly objects and the girls vote to kick him out of the house. Spurned, Teddy decides to join forces with the Radners to take down the sorority. They all go to the tailgate event to steal the weed. Teddy distracts the girls while Mac steals their weed supply. Shelby catches Mac, but he manages to escape. As gratitude for Teddy's help, Mac and Kelly allow him to stay at their place until he decides what he wants to do with his life, where he grows closer to them.
In retaliation for the tailgate, the girls switch Mac's and Kelly's phone numbers with their own, leading Kelly to become paranoid, and Mac to end up in Sydney, Australia. When he returns, Mac and Kelly find that they have been robbed and the sorority is selling their stuff and has spray-painted ""Kappa Nu Steals From You"" in the house. This causes the Baiers to threaten to pull out from the deal, while Mac and Kelly also reflect if they have been good parents. When the realtor of the sorority house reveals the girls are late on their payments, the Baiers give Mac and Kelly a day to get them out of the house. The girls find an eviction notice on their door. With barely any money to support themselves, Shelby says the only way they can win is to abandon their morals and resort to having a basic frat party with more sex appeal. They advertise the party to everyone on campus, leading to more people showing up at the house.
Jimmy and Paula sneak into the party while Teddy tries to shut off the power. Teddy gets into the electrical box, but the girls have a backup power source. While Jimmy ends up getting roofied, Shelby enters the Radners' house to cut off their phones. Mac and Teddy chase her to the garage, but get locked inside. They break out by using airbags from an old car.
Disgusted by how much they have degraded themselves, Beth and Nora decide to quit the sorority and blame Shelby for the disaster, leading the other girls to leave as well. Mac and Kelly feel sorry for the girls after hearing that Shelby only formed the sorority so she could make friends since back in high school she had none and was constantly bullied and rejected. They also realize that they too are setting a terrible example for their daughter with their behavior in ruining Kappa Nu by trying to evict the girls so they could allow the Baiers to move in to their old home. Relating to her own experience in being rejected through high school, Kelly helps the girls mend their friendship and to go back to what they believe in. The girls then kick the frat boys out and have a more empowering girl party. The success of being the first sorority to throw a party brings girls from Phi Lambda and other sororities who want to pledge for Kappa Nu. By the end of the night, the girls make enough money not only to keep their house, but to give the surplus to Mac and Kelly so they can rent out their house due to overflowing pledges. Mac and Kelly happily agree, as long as they get five money-buckets per month. Paula goes into labor, meanwhile Teddy apologizes to Pete and Darren for his behavior and gets reassurance that he will never lose his best friend. Mac and Kelly's anxiety about their parenthood is also alleviated as they realize they have been good parents all along.
Three months later, Teddy is helping Pete get ready to walk down the aisle. Teddy has become a wedding planner for gay couples and enabling him a worthwhile career. Mac and Kelly have now moved into their new home. They bring home their new baby, Mildred, to join Jimmy and Paula with their new son, Jimmy Jr."
The Nice Guys,"In 1977 Los Angeles, a boy named Bobby witnesses the death of fading porn star Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio) in a car crash. Later that week, down-on-his-luck alcoholic private eye Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is approached by Mrs. Glenn (Lois Smith), Misty's aunt, who claims to have seen her niece alive after her supposed death. March is skeptical of her claim, but realizes that a missing girl named Amelia Kuttner (Margaret Qualley) is somehow involved and accepts the job. However, Amelia does not wish to be found and hires unethical enforcer Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) to intimidate March into staying away from her.
Later that night, Healy is attacked at his home by two unnamed thugs credited as Blueface (Beau Knapp)—so named after a dye pack in Healy's briefcase hits his face—and Older Guy (Keith David), who attempt to interrogate him about Amelia's whereabouts. After stunning the duo, Healy manages to ward them off with a hidden shotgun. He then teams up with a reluctant March to find Amelia before the thugs do. The two are assisted by Holly (Angourie Rice), March's young daughter, despite March's attempts to keep her out of the case for her own safety.
March and Healey find out that Amelia was working with Misty Mountains and an amateur filmmaker named Dean on an ""experimental film""—equal parts pornography and investigative journalism—called How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy? about the smog in Los Angeles. Dean, however, mysteriously died in a fire that burned the film. The two end up at a party to search for the film's financier, Sid Shattuck, a notorious pornography producer. After fumbling through the party, a drunken March ends up finding Shattuck dead, while unknowingly coming across Amelia.
Holly, after attempting to investigate on her own, is tricked into a car by Blue Face and Older Guy. Healy fights with Older Guy, while Blue Face tries to kill Amelia from inside his car, only to be stopped by Holly, who warns Amelia and then escapes with her. While chasing them down, Blue Face is seriously injured in a hit-and-run. As he lies dying in the middle of the road, he reveals to Healy that their boss has dispatched a hit man named John Boy to kill Amelia, March and his family to prevent further witnesses. Healy discreetly strangles Blue Face to death to protect March and Holly, and lies to Holly that he died of his injuries. After a brief investigation, the two are greeted by Amelia's mother, Judith Kuttner (Kim Basinger), a high-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice, who claims her daughter is delusional and paranoid and points them towards the Las Vegas mob trying to expand into the Los Angeles pornography scene.
Healy reveals the notepaper with March's address given to him by Amelia is the same type of notepaper he found at the party on which are written leads to an airport hotel where Amelia was going to distribute the film. Upon arriving at the hotel, however, they witness men there being slaughtered by John Boy (Matt Bomer) and hastily retreat, only to have Amelia jump from the building and land on their car. They take Amelia back to March's house, where she reveals that the people after her are working for a cabal of Detroit automakers. After uncovering evidence that they colluded to suppress the catalytic converter (which regulates exhaust emissions), Amelia created the film to expose their collusion.
Judith has her assistant, Tally (Yaya DaCosta), arrange for March and Healy to deliver a briefcase that supposedly contains $100,000. When March dozes while driving and accidentally crashes their car, the case flies open to reveal shredded magazines; the double-cross was a diversion to leave Amelia unprotected. Sent by Tally under the guise of being a family doctor, John Boy attacks Holly before engaging in a shootout with March and Healy as soon as they return to the house. Hearing the sirens of approaching police cars, John Boy drives off while an impatient Amelia has fled the house, only to be killed by John Boy on the street when he inadvertently comes across her attempting to catch a ride.
March and Healy try to bring the matter to court, but are rejected, as they have no evidence, leading them again to search for the film. The two have Mrs. Glenn show them where she saw Misty Mountains alive. Inside they find a hidden projector—the nearsighted Mrs. Glenn having mistaken footage of Misty for her niece—and deduce that there was a reprint of the film. They realize that the projectionist, Chet (Jack Kilmer), another protester they had questioned about Dean, is the projectionist for the film and had worked with Amelia to make the film public by splicing it into the presentation film for the Los Angeles Auto Show, which is being held at a hotel. At the auto show, the two find that John Boy and Older Guy, along with a few other thugs are already there and have interrogated a drunken Chet, learning that the film will be projected automatically from a window of the building. Healy and March attempt to reach it first, only to be intercepted at gunpoint by Tally. Before she can kill them, Holly arrives while pretending to be room service and knocks Tally unconscious. In a subsequent fight, Older Guy falls to his death, while Healy subdues John Boy. He spares his life at Holly's behest.
The detectives take the film to the police, and although Judith is arrested, the Detroit car companies escape punishment. When she talks with March and Healy before her trial, Judith claims she did not want her daughter killed and justifies her involvement by insisting that ""what is good for Detroit is good for America."" Healy and March decide to continue working together as private eyes, naming their agency ""The Nice Guys""."
X-Men: Apocalypse,"En Sabah Nur, a powerful mutant believed to be the first of his kind, rules ancient Egypt until he is betrayed by his worshippers, who entomb him alive. His four lieutenants die preserving him. Awakening in 1983, he believes humanity has lost its way without his presence. Aiming to destroy and remake the world, he recruits a Cairo pickpocket Ororo Munroe, who can control the weather, and upgrades her power.
In East Berlin, shape-shifting mutant Raven investigates an underground fight club and discovers Kurt Wagner, a blue skinned mutant who can teleport. Raven rescues Kurt and requests black marketeer Caliban to transport him to America. En Sabah Nur recruits Caliban's enforcer, Psylocke, who leads him to mutant-fighting champion Angel. En Sabah Nur enhances both of their powers, transforming Angel's wings into metal.
Alex Summers discovers that his younger brother Scott is manifesting a mutation for shooting optic beams. Alex takes Scott to Professor Charles Xavier's educational institute in Westchester County, New York, hoping that Xavier and Hank McCoy will teach him to control his abilities. Scott meets the telepathic and telekinetic Jean Grey, and the two develop an attraction, while Raven brings Kurt to the institute. En Sabah Nur's powers cause disturbances around the world, leading Xavier and Alex to consult with CIA operative Moira MacTaggert, who has been researching the legend of Nur.
In Communist Poland, the metal-controlling mutant Erik Lehnsherr lives with his wife and their young daughter, Nina. When En Sabah Nur's resurrection causes a worldwide earthquake, he uses his powers to save a coworker, prompting the militia to capture him. When they accidentally kill Erik's family, he retaliates by executing them. En Sabah Nur later approaches the devastated Erik and takes him to Auschwitz, where Erik's power first manifested. Persuaded by En Sabah Nur, Erik has his powers enhanced, destroys the camp, and joins En Sabah Nur. En Sabah Nur remotely accesses Cerebro, a brainwave-amplifying device Xavier uses to locate mutants and forces the telepathic Xavier to make the global superpowers launch their entire nuclear arsenals into space to prevent interference with En Sabah Nur's plan. He and his new Four Horsemen arrive at the mansion and kidnap Xavier. Attempting to stop them, Alex accidentally causes an explosion that destroys the mansion. Peter Maximoff, having realized that he is Erik's biological son and hoping that Xavier can help to find him, arrives just in time; he uses his super-speed to evacuate the students and teachers before the explosion destroys the building, but fails to save Alex, who dies in the process. Colonel William Stryker's forces subsequently capture Hank, Raven, Peter, and Moira, and take them to a military facility for interrogation. Scott, Jean, and Kurt follow covertly, and liberate their comrades using Stryker's brainwashed experiment Weapon X, whose memories Jean partially restores.
At En Sabah Nur's behest, Erik uses his powers to control the Earth's magnetic poles, causing destruction across the planet. Sabah Nur plans to transfer his consciousness into Xavier's body, and use Xavier's power to enslave every person on Earth. Xavier secretly sends a telepathic distress call to Jean, and the others travel to Cairo to battle Sabah Nur and his horsemen. They rescue Xavier, but he loses his hair as the process nears completion. Angel is knocked unconscious from the plane crash. Erik and Ororo are persuaded to turn on En Sabah Nur and, with the help of Scott, they keep him occupied physically, while Xavier fights him telepathically in the astral plane. Finally, Xavier encourages Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers, incinerating En Sabah Nur, killing him for good, while Psylocke escapes. Xavier and Moira rekindle their relationship. Erik and Jean help reconstruct the school, but Erik refuses Xavier's offer to stay and help teach. Peter decides not to tell Erik yet that he is Erik's son. Using confiscated Sentinels,[4] Hank and Raven train the new X-Men recruits: Scott, Jean, Ororo, Kurt, and Peter.
In a post-credits scene, men in black suits visit the Weapon X facility to retrieve data on Stryker's mutant research, including an X-ray and a blood sample marked ""Weapon X"", on behalf of the Essex Corporation."
Alice Through the Looking Glass,"Chapter One – Looking-Glass House: Alice is playing with a white kitten (whom she calls ""Snowdrop"") and a black kitten (whom she calls ""Kitty"")—the offspring of Dinah, Alice's cat in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland—when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Climbing up onto the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she is able to step through it to an alternative world. In this reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass poetry, ""Jabberwocky"", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up.
Chapter Two – The Garden of Live Flowers: Upon leaving the house (where it had been a cold, snowy night), she enters a sunny spring garden where the flowers can speak; they perceive Alice as being a ""flower that can move about"". Elsewhere in the garden, Alice meets the Red Queen, who is now human-sized, and who impresses Alice with her ability to run at breathtaking speeds. This is a reference to the chess rule that queens are able to move any number of vacant squares at once, in any direction, which makes them the most ""agile"" of pieces.
Chapter Three – Looking-Glass Insects: The Red Queen reveals to Alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares, like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank/row in a chess match. This is a reference to the chess rule of Promotion. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen's pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that literally jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, thus acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move.
Chapter Four – Tweedledum and Tweedledee: She then meets the fat twin brothers Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who she knows from the famous nursery rhyme. After reciting the long poem ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"", the Tweedles draw Alice's attention to the Red King—loudly snoring away under a nearby tree—and maliciously provoke her with idle philosophical banter that she exists only as an imaginary figure in the Red King's dreams (thereby implying that she will cease to exist the instant he wakes up). Finally, the brothers begin acting out their nursery-rhyme by suiting up for battle, only to be frightened away by an enormous crow, as the nursery rhyme about them predicts.
Chapter Five – Wool and Water: Alice next meets the White Queen, who is very absent-minded but boasts of (and demonstrates) her ability to remember future events before they have happened. Alice and the White Queen advance into the chessboard's fifth rank by crossing over a brook together, but at the very moment of the crossing, the Queen transforms into a talking Sheep in a small shop. Alice soon finds herself struggling to handle the oars of a small rowboat, where the Sheep annoys her with (seemingly) nonsensical shouting about ""crabs"" and ""feathers"". Unknown to Alice, these are standard terms in the jargon of rowing. Thus (for a change) the Queen/Sheep was speaking in a perfectly logical and meaningful way.
Chapter Six – Humpty Dumpty: After crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank, Alice immediately encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in ""Jabberwocky"". In the process, he introduces Alice (and the reader) to the concept of portmanteau words, before his inevitable fall.
Chapter Seven – The Lion and the Unicorn: ""All the king's horses and all the king's men"" come to Humpty Dumpty's assistance, and are accompanied by the White King, along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting with each other. In this chapter, the March Hare and Hatter of the first book make a brief re-appearance in the guise of ""Anglo-Saxon messengers"" called ""Haigha"" and ""Hatta"" (i.e. ""Hare"" and ""Hatter""—these names are the only hint given as to their identities other than John Tenniel's illustrations).
Chapter Eight – “It’s my own Invention”: Upon leaving the Lion and Unicorn to their fight, Alice reaches the seventh rank by crossing another brook into the forested territory of the Red Knight, who is intent on capturing the ""white pawn""—who is Alice—until the White Knight comes to her rescue. Escorting her through the forest towards the final brook-crossing, the Knight recites a long poem of his own composition called Haddocks' Eyes, and repeatedly falls off his horse. His clumsiness is a reference to the ""eccentric"" L-shaped movements of chess knights, and may also be interpreted as a self-deprecating joke about Lewis Carroll's own physical awkwardness and stammering in real life.
Chapter Nine – Queen Alice: Bidding farewell to the White Knight, Alice steps across the last brook, and is automatically crowned a queen, with the crown materialising abruptly on her head. She soon finds herself in the company of both the White and Red Queens, who relentlessly confound Alice by using word play to thwart her attempts at logical discussion. They then invite one another to a party that will be hosted by the newly crowned Alice—of which Alice herself had no prior knowledge.
Chapter Ten – Shaking: Alice arrives and seats herself at her own party, which quickly turns to a chaotic uproar—much like the ending of the first book. Alice finally grabs the Red Queen, believing her to be responsible for all the day's nonsense, and begins shaking her violently with all her might. By thus ""capturing"" the Red Queen, Alice unknowingly puts the Red King (who has remained stationary throughout the book) into checkmate, and thus is allowed to wake up.
Chapter Eleven – Waking: Alice suddenly awakes in her armchair to find herself holding the black kitten, who she deduces to have been the Red Queen all along, with the white kitten having been the White Queen.
Chapter Twelve – Which dreamed it?: The story ends with Alice recalling the speculation of the Tweedle brothers, that everything may have, in fact, been a dream of the Red King, and that Alice might herself be no more than a figment of his imagination. One final poem is inserted by the author as a sort of epilogue which suggests that life itself is but a dream."
TMNT 2: Out of the Shadows,"Two years after their battle with Shredder and Eric Sacks, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo, still live beneath the sewers of New York City, having allowed Vern Fenwick to take the credit for Shredder's defeat. At Grand Central Station, April O'Neil discovers and informs the turtles that scientist Baxter Stockman is working for Shredder and plans to bust him out of prison. As Shredder is transferred between prisons alongside criminals Bebop and Rocksteady by corrections officer Casey Jones, the Foot Clan attack the convoy transporting them. Despite the turtles' interference, Shredder escapes when Stockman uses a teleportation device. Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport, winds up in another dimension, and meets the alien warlord Krang, who reveals his plans to invade Earth. He gives Shredder a purple mutagenic compound in exchange for his promise to find three components of a machine that Krang sent to Earth long ago which will open a portal to his dimension when united, knowing that Shredder and Stockman have the first piece. Casey tells NYPD chief Rebecca Vincent what happened to Shredder but is met with disbelief, and decides to go out on his own.
Shredder returns to NY, recruits Bebop and Rocksteady, who also escaped, and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them into powerful animal mutants—a humanoid warthog and rhinoceros. April witnesses their transformation and is able to steal the remaining mutagen vial. Pursued by the Foot, she is rescued by Casey, who uses hockey gear, but the vial is taken into police custody. April then introduces Casey to the turtles, and Raphael and Michelangelo make fun of and pull pranks on him. In the lair, Donatello deduces that the mutagen could be used to turn the turtles into humans, enabling them to live normal lives above ground, but Leonardo refuses and insists on keeping it a secret from the others. However, Michelangelo overhears their conversation and tells Raphael, which enrages Raphael and leads to a fierce argument between the brothers. Leonardo benches Raphael and takes Michelangelo off the mission. In the Natural History Museum, Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady find the second piece and steal it before Leonardo and Donatello arrive. Still furious, Raphael recruits Michelangelo, April, Casey, and Vern to break into the NYPD headquarters and retrieve the mutagen. Vern distracts the police while April and Casey retrieve the mutagen, but the Foot arrive ahead of them. In the ensuing battle, the turtles' existence is revealed to the police, who react with fear and hatred, and April and Casey are arrested while helping the brothers escape with the mutagen. Vincent also sees on TCRI's cameras that April stole the mutagen, but Stockman had edited the tape so only April is seen.
The turtles track Bebop and Rocksteady as they recover the final piece of the device in the rainforests of Manaus, Brazil, and board Rocksteady and Bebop's jet in midair. In the resulting battle, the jet is critically damaged after Rocksteady fires a tank-mounted machine gun in the cargo hold, and crashes into a river. As the Turtles fight Bebop in the river for control of the piece, Rocksteady emerges in the tank and helps Bebop escape with the piece. The turtles return to NY as Shredder and Stockman complete the device and open a portal to Krang's dimension through which his modular war machine, the Technodrome, begins to emerge. Shredder betrays Stockman and his men take him to their headquarters in Tokyo. When entering the Technodrome, Krang likewise betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him with his collection of other defeated foes.
Seeing no way to reach the Technodrome as the police pursue them, the turtles debate over taking the mutagen to become human and fight openly. While Leonardo agrees, Raphael shatters the vial, realizing they must accept who they are. Upon April's request, Vern recovers the security footage from a hidden TCRI camera disguised as a clock that proves Stockman and Shredder's collaboration and secures April and Casey's release. April arranges a meeting between the turtles and Vincent, and convinces her that they are not enemies and were the ones who defeated Shredder in the first place. With the help of the police, the turtles are able to jump from the Chrysler Building and confront Krang aboard the still-assembling Technodrome. Although Krang is able to overpower all four turtles easily, they defeat him when Donatello short circuits Krang's robotics body. April, Casey and Vern raid the Foot Clan facility, defeat Bebop, Rocksteady and Shredder's lieutenant Karai and take control of the device. The turtles are able to hurl the ship's beacon back through the portal, taking Krang and the rest of the Technodrome with it, as April, Casey, and Vern shut the portal down. As he disappears, Krang vows to return stronger for revenge.
A week later, Bebop and Rocksteady are back in custody, while Stockman remains at large. At night, the turtles are honored by Vincent and the NYPD along with April, Casey, and Vern, and given golden keys to the city. Vincent offers to introduce the turtles to the public, allowing them to lead normal lives, but the turtles opt to keep their existence a secret while still helping as they always have. On top of the Statue of Liberty, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles celebrate their victory over the vanquished Krang."
Me Before You,"26-year-old Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) is a happy, outgoing woman who lives with and supports her working-class family. After losing her job at a local cafe, she is hired as the caregiver of Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), a former successful banker and once active young man who became paralyzed after being involved in a motorcycle accident two years prior. Louisa has no experience but Will's mother believes her cheery personality will help lift his spirits. Will only spends time with Nathan, his nurse, who assists with his care, exercise and movement and knows that he will never regain use of his body due to the damage to his spinal cord.
Cynical and depressed because he can no longer live an active life, Will initially reacts coldly to Louisa's upbeat demeanor and treats her with contempt. After two weeks, Will has a visit from his former best friend Rupert and ex-girlfriend Alicia who reveal that they are engaged. Will manages to smash all the photographs on his dresser in anger and indignation, which Louisa tries to repair the next day, leading to a verbal altercation during which Louisa chastises him for ""being an arse"". The next day, Will asks Louisa to watch a film with subtitles with him, and she accepts. The two begin to bond and eventually become close friends. Louisa and Will continue to talk daily; she learns that he is cultured and worldly, having traveled extensively. In contrast, her life so far has been simple, without many interests or hobbies or travel away from home. Her long-term boyfriend, Patrick (Matthew Lewis), is training to take part in a Viking triathlon in Norway, a hobby that he often chooses over spending time with her. Will urges Louisa to broaden her horizons and tells her that it's her responsibility to live life as fully as possible.
While taking care of him during one of his occasional illnesses, Louisa notices Will's scarred wrists from a previous suicide attempt. While at work one day, Louisa overhears an argument of Will's parents and she learns that Will has given his parents six months before checking in to Dignitas in Switzerland for assisted suicide. Will refuses to accept life with a disability that entails dependency, pain and suffering without any hope for recovery of his old self. Louisa then takes it upon herself to change his mind. She organizes various trips and adventures to show Will that life is worth living, despite his disability. Will gradually becomes more communicative and open to her plans. The pair attends the horse-racing, with disastrous consequences and a few days afterwards, goes to a Mozart concert. Will then decides to attend Alicia's wedding and asks Louisa to accompany him. At the wedding, Louisa and Will enjoy offending the straight-laced guests. Louisa learns from the bride's godmother that she considers Will to be Alicia's 'one that got away'.
Will joins Louisa's family for dinner on her birthday, where they learn that Louisa's father had lost his job in a leveraged buyout that happened to have been organized by a younger associate of Will. Shortly thereafter Louisa's father is offered the head of maintenance job at Stortfold Castle which belongs to Will's family and Louisa realizes that Will is trying to help her secure her freedom from her family. Gradually they develop strong feelings for one another, which makes Patrick jealous and causes problems in Louisa's long-standing relationship, leading to their break-up.
During a luxurious trip to the island of Mauritius together, undertaken after another bout with pneumonia and with help from Will's nurse, Will informs Louisa that he still intends to follow through with the euthanasia. He wants her to live a full life instead of ""half a life"" with him. He says their time together has been special, but he cannot bear to live in a wheelchair. He asks her to accompany him to Switzerland to be with him through his last moments. Heartbroken, she informs Will's parents upon arrival in London that she is quitting immediately and travels back to her home by bus. She does not speak to Will for the days that follow. However, at home, Louisa's father convinces her to go to Will in Switzerland. She finds out that he has already left for Switzerland, and decides to go to Switzerland herself to be with Will in his final moments.
A few weeks after Will's death, sitting in his favorite cafe in Paris, she rereads the letter Will left for her. In it he encourages her to seek out a specific perfume shop and ends off the letter with 'just live', which she can afford to do because he has left her enough money to follow her dreams."
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,"Told in the form of a musical documentary, Conner Friel (Andy Samberg) is a musical prodigy at an early age, and he forms a rap group, The Style Boyz, with his childhood friends Lawrence (Akiva Schaffer) and Owen (Jorma Taccone). They almost instantly gain fame in the music industry, inspiring many of today's musicians. However, failing to receive credit for writing Conner's guest verse on the Poppy-winning single ""Turn Up the Beef"", Lawrence leaves.
After the Style Boyz disband, Conner becomes a solo act, taking on the name ""Conner4Real"", with Owen as his DJ. Lawrence begins farming in Colorado after a failed attempt at going solo. Conner's debut album, Thriller, Also, rockets to the top of the charts and Conner's fame increases. In 2015, Conner releases his sophomore album, Connquest, which receives terrible reviews due to Conner using hundreds of producers rather than Owen's beats. With sales surprisingly low, Conner's manager, Harry (Tim Meadows), suggests having Aquaspin, a manufacturer that makes home appliances, sponsor the tour. The company's appliances begin playing Conner's songs when in use, causing a nationwide power outage that generates a wave of backlash among Conner's fans.
Conner begins his album tour, but the shows do not sell as well as he had hoped. Harry suggests they hire hip-hop artist Hunter the Hungry (Chris Redd) as an opening act, and the ticket sales begin to rise. Conner starts to add new gimmicks to his act, including a robotic mask for Owen, publicizing his relationship with actress Ashley Wednesday (Imogen Poots), and a stage trick where he changes costumes in seconds behind a curtain. The trick is seemingly botched in Nashville, when Conner becomes naked (without a penis) mid-concert, thus becoming the subject of mockery.
Conner's publicist, Paula (Sarah Silverman), suggests he pull another publicity stunt to deflect attention from his humiliation. Conner decides to propose to Ashley on live TV, with a display including a number of trained wolves and a performance by Seal. The music agitates the wolves and they break loose, mauling Seal and the attendees. The backlash against Conner grows, and Ashley breaks up with him and starts dating Seal, who sues Conner for his injuries.
Owen, worried about the declining quality of his friend's music, sets up a meeting between himself, Conner, and Lawrence. The reunion ends poorly when Conner refuses to acknowledge that Lawrence wrote the track that launched his career. Despite Conner's poor reputation, The Tonight Show agrees to book him on an episode. Jimmy Fallon suddenly invites Conner to perform the Style Boyz' hit song ""Donkey Roll"" along with Owen, which is received well by the crowd despite Conner's reluctance.
As the tour progresses, Hunter begins to overshadow Conner, selling more records than him and dragging out his act before Conner's show. At a concert, Hunter announces that he will perform as long as possible, causing Conner to rush the stage. A brawl ensues when Hunter quietly admits that he orchestrated Conner's wardrobe malfunction. Conner demands that Harry let Hunter go and fires Harry after finding out that he has signed Hunter. Connquest is later knocked off the charts and Aquaspin decides to pull their sponsorship. The remainder of the tour is cancelled, and Owen decides to leave the team when Conner questions his loyalty. After his beloved pet turtle dies, Conner sinks into a depression and moves into his mother's house. He begins drinking heavily and starts selling crude horse drawings online.
Paula forces Conner to leave the house and takes him to a club featuring Owen. Owen's music and production are strong, though his singing is subpar. Conner and Owen reconcile and decide to finally make amends with Lawrence. Conner gives Lawrence his Poppy and apologizes, acknowledging Lawrence's contribution to his music. Conner and Owen discover that Lawrence owns a giant marijuana farm and a music studio in his farmhouse. As the three collaborate in Lawrence's studio, Conner receives news from Paula that a six-minute slot has opened for Conner to perform at the Poppy Music Awards, and with encouragement from his friends, he decides to reunite The Style Boyz.
At the Poppys, Hunter humiliates himself after arguing with Mariah Carey on stage and Harry quits as his manager after being insulted by him. Conner reconciles with Harry and later finds out that the six-minute slot has been shortened to three minutes, forcing him to perform either a Conner4Real song or a Style Boyz song. Conner decides to perform The Style Boyz's new song, ""Incredible Thoughts"" featuring Michael Bolton. The film ends with Conner reflecting on the lessons he has learned and the value of holding onto relationships after reaching stardom, and introduces a new baby turtle named Maximus II."
The Conjuring 2,"In 1976, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren document the Amityville murders at the Amityville house, to determine if a demonic presence was truly responsible for Ronald DeFeo Jr. murdering his family on November 13, 1974, and the subsequent haunting incident involving the Lutz family. During a seance, Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders. A demonic nun figure appears and lures her to the basement, where she witnesses Ed being impaled before breaking out of the vision.
In 1977, the Hodgson family begins to experience strange occurrences in their home in the London suburb of Enfield. Janet, the second oldest of four children, is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity in the form of an angry elderly man, who insists that the house is his. Eventually, all the Hodgson siblings and their mother Peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes, forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors. When the media attempts to interview the Hodgsons, Janet is possessed by the spirit of the elderly man, Bill Wilkins, who is revealed to have previously lived and died in the house. During the possession, Wilkins states that he enjoys tormenting the family and wants to reclaim his home. As Janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession, the story eventually reaches the Warrens, and their assistance is requested to assist the local church in an investigation to prove whether or not Janet's possession is a hoax. Lorraine, fearful that her vision of Ed's death may become reality, warns him not to get too involved in the case, but she reluctantly agrees to travel to London with him. She has yet another vision of the demonic nun in Ed's study wherein the demon says its name, which Lorraine scribbles in her Bible.
While staying at the Hodgson residence, Ed and Lorraine consult with other paranormal investigators, including Maurice Grosse and Anita Gregory, on the legitimacy of the case. They also attempt to communicate with Wilkins' spirit, hoping to convince him to stop haunting the family. One night, after the Hodgsons witness Janet being possessed, Gregory presents video evidence of Janet purposely wrecking the kitchen as if for a practical joke, thereby discrediting the haunting. Based on this discovery, Ed and Lorraine feel they have no choice but to leave the family on their own but soon discover that the spirit of Wilkins is only a pawn being manipulated by the demonic nun, to haunt Janet and break her will. Lorraine then realizes that her abilities have been blocked by the demonic nun, preventing her from grasping the truth of Janet's possession.
Ed and Lorraine quickly return to the Hodgson residence, only to find Janet being possessed once more and the rest of the Hodgsons locked outside the house. Ed ventures inside the house alone. A lightning strike hits a tree near the house, leaving a jagged stump resembling the object that impaled Ed in Lorraine's vision. Ed finds Janet standing near the window, ready to leap onto the stump and commit suicide. He manages to grab Janet in time, but finds himself holding onto a curtain that is being torn from its rings by his and Janet's weight. Lorraine remembers that she wrote the demon's name – Valak – in her Bible. She enters the house and confronts Valak, addressing it by name and successfully condemns it back to Hell. Janet is freed of its possession, and Lorraine pulls her and Ed to safety.
After returning home to the United States, Ed adds an item to his and Lorraine's collection – ""The Crooked Man"" zoetrope toy owned by Peggy's youngest child Billy – placing it near April's music box and the Annabelle doll."
Warcraft,"Draenor, the homeworld of the orcs, is being torn apart by a mysterious force known as fel magic. Gul'dan, a powerful orc warlock, unites the orc clans and forms the Horde, and creates a portal to the world of Azeroth. The orcs begin to use fel magic to drain the life out of captive draenei in order to sustain the portal. Once it is operational, Gul'dan leads a small warband to capture prisoners on Azeroth and sacrifice them to bring the rest of the Horde through the portal. Durotan, the chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, his pregnant mate Draka, and his friend Orgrim Doomhammer join this initial warband. While crossing through the portal, Draka goes into labor. When the orcs arrive on Azeroth, Gul'dan assists Draka with giving birth, but while the baby is born alive, it is in neonatal distress, struggling to breathe, and is near death. Gul'dan then drains the life out of a nearby deer to revive and infuse fel magic into the baby, which Durotan later names Go'el.
The orcs raid several settlements throughout Azeroth. Anduin Lothar, the military commander of the human forces in the Stormwind Kingdom, looks over some of the men that were killed, and finds a trespassing mage named Khadgar, who explains that he was investigating the dead bodies because they contained traces of fel magic. Khadgar persuades Stormwind's king, Llane Wrynn, to consult Medivh, the renowned Guardian of Tirisfal, and Llane sends Anduin and Khadgar to Medivh's stronghold, Karazhan, to inform him of the fel magic's presence on Azeroth. In the Karazhan library, a ghostly shadow leads Khadgar to a mysterious book, which he takes.
Anduin, Khadgar, and Medivh join a scouting team following traces of fel magic but are ambushed by orcs. Medivh uses a spell to kill the fel-corrupted orcs, leaving the Horde's warchief, Blackhand, to flee along with Durotan and Orgrim. Khadgar restrains a half-orc slave, Garona, and the soldiers take her prisoner. King Llane frees Garona in exchange for loyalty to Stormwind, and she leads the humans to spy on the orc camp, where they learn of Gul'dan's plan to bring the Horde to Azeroth. Meanwhile, Durotan realizes that the fel magic is responsible for the destruction of Draenor, and if Gul'dan is not thwarted, Azeroth will suffer the same fate. Despite Orgrim's objections, Durotan invites Llane to a secret meeting so that the Frostwolf Clan and the humans can unite to defeat Gul'dan. While studying the book that he took from Karazhan, Khadgar learns that Gul'dan could not have opened the portal on his own; he had help from someone on Azeroth. He is confronted by Medivh, who burns Khadgar's research when Khadgar offers to help him with his work.
The Frostwolf Clan meets with the humans to negotiate an alliance, but the group is ambushed by Blackhand. As the humans retreat, Medivh forms a magical barrier to protect them, but Lothar's son Callan is separated from the rest of the group and killed by Blackhand. Medivh is severely weakened, and Garona and Khadgar take him back to Karazhan to recover. After noticing Medivh's eyes shine green, showing that he is infected by fel magic, Khadgar returns to his former home, Dalaran, to seek help from the Kirin Tor, the authority of human and high elven mages. The Kirin Tor facilitate a meeting with Alodi, revealed to be the shadow who led Khadgar to the book; she confirms that Medivh has indeed been corrupted by fel magic and turned into a demon. At the orc camp, Blackhand purges the Frostwolf Clan. Orgrim helps Draka to escape, and she sends Go'el down a river in a basket, but is then found and killed by another orc. Durotan challenges Gul'dan to Mak'gora, a traditional orcish duel to the death for leadership of a clan – in this case, all of the orcs. During the fight, Gul'dan violates the honorable combat rules by draining the life out of Durotan with his magic, killing him and earning the disapproval of the orcs watching, and he empowers Blackhand with the same magic. Medivh, now in a half-demonic state, starts to open the portal to Draenor, and Gul'dan begins sacrificing the captured human villagers to allow the rest of the Horde to enter Azeroth.
Llane leads the human army in an assault on the orc camp, while Anduin and Khadgar fight Medivh and destroy the demon that had begun to manifest on the outside. Medivh is left mortally wounded, and uses the last of his strength to close the portal to Draenor and instead open a portal to Stormwind, allowing Llane to evacuate most of the freed prisoners. When Medivh eventually dies, the portal closes, leaving Llane, Garona and a small number of human soldiers to fight the orcs. Llane secretly orders Garona to kill him, bringing her honor among the orcs and putting her in a position of power to bring peace between the two races. Garona reluctantly does so and is welcomed into the Horde by Gul'dan. As the orcs celebrate, Lothar arrives to retrieve King Llane's body and discovers Garona's knife still in Llane's neck, realizing that it was she who had killed their king. Blackhand challenges Lothar to Mak'gora, and Lothar quickly disposes of him. Against Gul'dan's demands, the orcs, bound by tradition, allow Lothar to depart with Llane's body. At Llane's funeral in Stormwind, the leaders of the other human nations, along with the high elves and dwarves, proclaim an alliance against the orcs and rally behind Lothar as the leader of the Alliance forces. Elsewhere, Orgrim takes one of Durotan's tusks to one day give to Go'el, and the basket containing Go'el is found by a human."
Now You See Me 2,"Eighteen months after outwitting the FBI, the remaining members of the Four Horsemen—J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco)—are in hiding in New York City, awaiting further instructions from The Eye, the secret society of magicians they've been recruited into. Atlas, having grown tired of waiting for a mission, seeks out The Eye himself. His search leads him to an underground tunnel in which he hears a voice that tells him that his wait may be coming to an end. The Horsemen's handler, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), ultimately assigns them a new mission, exposing corrupt businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb), whose new software secretly steals data on its users for Case's benefit. Lula May (Lizzy Caplan) is added to the team to replace former member Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), who has left the Horsemen after breaking up with Atlas.
The Horsemen hijack the launch party for the new software, but the show is interrupted by a mysterious individual who reveals to the world that Wilder, believed to be dead, is actually alive, and that Rhodes is their mole, forcing him to escape. While escaping, the Horsemen enter their escape tube on a roof and emerge in Macau, where they are captured by mercenaries and Chase McKinney (also played by Woody Harrelson), Merritt's twin brother. The Horsemen are then brought before Chase's employer, technology prodigy Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe), Case's former business partner, who faked his own death after Case stole Walter's company. Mabry conscripts the Horsemen into stealing the data-mining device developed by Case to prevent him from using it. The chip allows the user to decrypt and access any electronic device around the world. The Horsemen agree to steal the device.
They get supplies at a famous magic shop in Macau, run by Li (Jay Chou) and Bu Bu (Tsai Chin), and secretly contact The Eye to arrange to hand over the device after they steal it. Meanwhile, Rhodes is branded a fugitive and forced to spring his rival Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), whom Rhodes blames for the death of his father, out of jail for help.
The Horsemen infiltrate the facility and steal the chip, despite being interrogated and searched by security guard Allen Scott-Frank (Henry Lloyd-Hughes). Atlas is then confronted by Mabry, revealing that Atlas had been fooled into thinking that Mabry was The Eye. Rhodes intervenes and pretends to retrieve the device, but is captured by Mabry's henchmen and taken to a nearby yacht. There, he learns Mabry is acting on behalf of his father, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), whom Rhodes exposed with the help of the Horsemen in the first film. Tressler places Rhodes in a replica of the same safe that his father died in and leaves him to drown, but Rhodes escapes and is rescued by the Horsemen. They find that the chip they had stolen appears to be a fake.
Rhodes and the Horsemen broadcast that they will be performing live in London at midnight on New Year's Eve. Mabry and Tressler, thinking that they have the computer chip, make haste to London, where the Horsemen are performing a series of tricks on the streets. At the Shard, Mabry, Tressler and Chase discover that Rhodes is still alive and capture the five, taking them on his private plane. Mabry takes the card from them, and Rhodes and the other Horsemen are thrown out of the plane supposedly in flight. However, Tressler finds that the plane has never taken off, and instead is on a barge in the middle of the River Thames, with their criminal activities being broadcast live to the world by the Horsemen in the process. Mabry, Tressler and Chase are arrested and Rhodes, now going by his real surname, ""Shrike"", entrusts the information they've gathered on the real criminals' activities to the FBI, who allows him a head start to escape.
Rhodes and the Horsemen are then taken to meet the leaders of the Eye in a secret library in Greenwich Observatory. They find that the members of the Eye include Li, Bu Bu, Allen Scott-Frank and Thaddeus Bradley. Bradley reveals that he was actually Lionel Shrike's partner, and he had been masquerading as his rival as part of their planned act: he had exposed Lionel's first act planning to be dumbfounded by his second act, only to abandon the Eye after Lionel's death. Before Bradley leaves, he asks Rhodes to be his successor in the Eye's leadership and requests that the Horsemen enter a curtain. The Horsemen, along with Rhodes, go behind the curtain, and find a door behind it. They enter the room and find a staircase; the camera zooms out to the stairs, forming an Eye."
Finding Dory,"Dory, a regal blue tang, gets separated from her parents as a child. As she grows up, Dory attempts to search for them, but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss. In the flashback of the previous film, Finding Nemo, she joins Marlin – a clownfish looking for his missing son Nemo – after accidentally swimming into him.
One year later, Dory is living with Marlin and Nemo on their reef. One day, Dory has a flashback and remembers that she has parents. She decides to look for them, but her memory problem is an obstacle. She eventually remembers that they lived at the Jewel of Morro Bay across the ocean in California, thanks to Nemo mentioning its name.
Marlin and Nemo accompany Dory. With the help of Crush, their sea turtle friend, they ride a water current to California. Upon arrival, they explore a shipwreck full of destroyed cargo, where Dory accidentally awakens a giant squid, who immediately pursues them and almost devours Nemo. Marlin berates Dory for endangering them. Her feelings hurt, Dory travels to the surface to seek help and is captured by staff members from the nearby Marine Life Institute after getting entangled in six pack rings.
Dory is placed in the quarantine section and tagged. There she meets a grouchy but well-meaning octopus named Hank. Dory's tag shows that she will be sent to an aquarium in Cleveland. Due to a traumatic ocean life, Hank wants to live in the aquarium instead of being released back into the ocean, so he agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted whale shark who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a beluga whale who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to echolocate. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an undertow current.
Marlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two sea lions named Fluke and Rudder and a disfigured common loon named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory's parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory believing that they have died. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty brain coral with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, she sees her parents Jenny and Charlie in the distance. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.
Marlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once on board the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the sea, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo.
In a post-credits scene, the Tank Gang from Finding Nemo, still trapped inside their (now algae-covered) plastic bags, reach California one year after floating across the Pacific Ocean. They are eventually picked up by staff members from the Marine Life Institute."
Central Intelligence,"In 1996, star athlete Calvin Joyner is being honored at his high school. Halfway through Calvin's speech, Trevor Olson and a group of bullies throw a naked Robbie Weirdicht, who was showering, into the hall where the assembly is taking place, embarrassing him. Only Calvin and his girlfriend, Maggie Johnson, are sympathetic towards Wierdicht.
Twenty years later, Calvin is married to Maggie and works as a forensic accountant but is dissatisfied with his career. Maggie suggests they see a therapist to salvage their deteriorating marriage. At work, Calvin receives a friend request on Facebook from a man named Bob Stone, who reveals that he is Wierdicht and requests that they meet. Calvin is shocked to see that Wierdicht has transformed into a muscular, confident man. Stone asks Calvin to review a few accounting records. Calvin deciphers the records as multimillion-dollar transactions from an auction, with the final payment set to be made the following day. Stone avoids Calvin's questions and spends the night on his couch.
The next morning, a group of CIA agents led by Pamela Harris arrive at Calvin's house in search of Stone, who escapes. Harris tells Joyner that Stone is a dangerous rogue agent who intends to sell satellite codes to the highest bidder. Soon after, Stone abducts Calvin and explains that he is trying to stop a criminal known as the Black Badger from selling the codes but needs Calvin's skills to find the coordinates of the deal's location. He tells Calvin that his partner Phil Stanton has been murdered by the Black Badger while Phil was stuck in an elevator. After an attack by a bounty hunter, Calvin flees and calls Maggie, telling her to meet him at the marriage counselor's office. Harris intercepts him and tells him that Stone murdered Phil in the elevator and is the Black Badger himself. She warns him to refrain from telling Maggie and gives him a device to alert them to Stone's location. Calvin then arrives for marriage counseling, where he finds Stone posing as the counselor.
Bob convinces Calvin to help him, and Calvin sets up a meeting with Trevor, who is able to track the offshore account for the auction, so they can get the deal's location. Trevor helps them and says that he's found God and apologizes to both of them, but later reveals he lied and laughs in their faces and bullies Bob once again. Harris calls Calvin and threatens to arrest Maggie if he fails to help them detain Stone. Calvin is forced to betray Stone, and the CIA arrests him. As Harris tortures Stone to get him to confess, Calvin decides to help Stone escape. Calvin deduces that the deal is happening in Boston and helps Stone steal a plane. At an underground parking garage, where the deal is assumed to be taking place, Stone enters alone, while Calvin sees Harris entering a short while later. He mistakenly assumes that she is the Black Badger and runs after her, but finds Stone meeting with the buyer and claiming to be the Black Badger. Bob shoots Calvin, grazing his neck, to keep him safe.
Phil arrives, revealing that he faked his death in the elevator and claims he is the real Black Badger. The buyer attempts to retrieve codes from both Stone and Stanton, but the CIA arrives and a shootout begins, while Calvin grabs both codes and runs outside. He encounters Stone and Stanton, who engage in combat. Unable to decide who is the criminal, Calvin randomly shoots Stone, but Phil confesses that he is the Black Badger and that Bob is innocent. Calvin causes a distraction that allows Bob to rip Phil's throat out, killing him. The two deliver the codes to Harris, who then drops them off at their high school reunion, where Calvin reconciles with Maggie. Bob is announced as the Homecoming King, with Calvin revealing to Maggie that he hacked the voting system to ensure Bob's win. Trevor attempts to bully Bob a third time, but Bob knocks him out. As Bob delivers his speech, he relives his most embarrassing high-school moment and takes off all his clothes confidently. He walks off stage to unite with his high school crush Darla McGuckian.
Before the ending credits, Maggie is pregnant and Calvin has joined the CIA. As a gift for his first day on the job, Stone gives Calvin his varsity jacket from high school back, which Calvin had given to him after the senior assembly prank."
Independence Day: Resurgence,"Twenty years after the devastating alien invasion, the United Nations has set up the Earth Space Defense (ESD), a global defense and research program that reverse-engineers alien technology and serves as Earth's early warning system against extraterrestrial threats.[4][5][6] Civilization has been restored and relative peace among nations exists following the human race's victory over the aliens' attacks.
As the twentieth anniversary of the invasion approaches, ESD Director David Levinson meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale d'Umbutu.[7] They travel to an intact alien city destroyer and discover that alien survivors sent a distress call to their home world before their defeat. It is revealed that former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore, Dr. Brackish Okun, and Umbutu are telepathically linked to the aliens, following personal encounters, and have visions of an unidentified spherical object.
An unidentified spherical ship emerges from a wormhole near Earth's Moon, and despite objections from Levinson, is destroyed on the orders of the United Nations Security Council. Defying orders, American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then pick up Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a space tug. They head for the wreckage in the Van de Graaff crater, where they recover a large container. An alien mothership suddenly appears,[7] responding to the distress call, and proceeds to destroy much of the Earth's planetary defenses before landing over the North Atlantic Ocean, where it starts to drill down toward the Earth's molten core. Narrowly escaping death, those on board the space tug are able to avoid capture and return to Area 51.
Whitmore, Levinson, and U.S. General Joshua Adams' groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51's prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in eusociality and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Levinson hypothesizes that, if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and retreat. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are caught in a trap within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.
In Area 51, Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of virtual intelligence. She reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refuge from worlds targeted by the aliens, whom she calls ""Harvesters"", and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters' planet. In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.
Knowing the Harvester Queen has become aware of the sphere's location, the ESD hide her in an isolation chamber and use a decoy in Jake's space tug to lure the Harvester Queen's ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a suicide mission, leading the Queen's ship into a trap before detonating a bomb, thus sacrificing himself but destroying the enemy ship. However, the Harvester Queen survives by using an energy shield and a fight breaks out. Initially, the ESD soldiers' weapons cannot penetrate the Queen's shield, but after the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon, a good shot by Whitmore's daughter Patricia disables her shield. This allows Dylan's party, which arrives just in time, to ultimately kill her before she can take the sphere. With the Queen dead, all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive, while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space. Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead her resistance and has offered them new technology in preparation for a counterattack on the Harvester's home world."
The Shallows,"Shortly after the death of her mother, medical student Nancy Adams travels to a secluded beach in Mexico, the same beach her mother visited while she was pregnant with Nancy. Carlos, a friendly local resident, gives Nancy a ride and drops her off at the beach. Nancy joins two other locals and the three surf for several hours. Taking a break from surfing, Nancy video-chats with her sister Chloe. When she talks to her father in an emotional and strained conversation, it is revealed that her mother's death caused Nancy to consider dropping out of medical school.
While surfing one last time for the day, Nancy notices the carcass of a large humpback whale nearby. As she rides the last wave back to the beach, a large great white shark knocks her off her surfboard and bites her leg. Nancy climbs onto the whale carcass, but the shark rams it from underneath, forcing her to swim to an isolated rock. She uses her surfboard strap to slow the bleeding on her leg. Later she uses her jewelry to put rudimentary stitches in place to hold her torn flesh together. Nancy is left alone when the unaware locals leave the beach, and she spends the night on the rock with a wounded seagull, who was also injured from the whale, she names him Steven Seagull. The next morning, a drunk local man on the beach steals Nancy's belongings. While wading out into the shallow water, to steal Nancy's surfboard, he is killed by the shark. Several hours later, the two locals Nancy had surfed with the day before return. They get into the water before Nancy can warn them away, and are also killed by the shark.
One of the local surfers was wearing a GoPro camera on his helmet. When he was attacked by the shark, his helmet had come off and floated to the surface. Nancy later sees the helmet floating in the water. After some struggle, she is able to retrieve it and notices in the footage of the attack, the shark has a large hook stuck in its mouth after a possible encounter with fishermen. Nancy uses the GoPro to leave messages for her sister and father as well as information about the shark attack and her location.
With high tide approaching, Nancy realizes the rock will be submerged soon. After sending Steven Seagull toward shore on a piece of the surfboard, and timing the shark's circles from the whale carcass to the rock, Nancy swims to a nearby buoy, narrowly avoiding the shark by swimming through a group of jellyfish, which sting both the shark and her. Nancy finds a flare gun on the buoy. She shoots one flare to draw the attention of a faraway cargo ship, but the ship is already turned away and it never sees her. She then fires another flare at the shark, setting the oil from the whale carcass alight and angering it, but otherwise has no effect. The shark then ferociously attacks the buoy and rips out the chains securing it to the ocean bed. Nancy straps herself to the last remaining chain and as it is ripped from the buoy, she is pulled down to the ocean floor, pursued by the shark. At the last moment, Nancy pulls out of the dive, and the shark impales itself on some rebar from the buoy's anchor.
Later, a boy named Miguel at the beach finds the action camera and informs his father, Carlos. Carlos finds Nancy floating close to shore and revives her. Nancy briefly sees a hallucination of her mother. As she looks around the beach, she sees that Steven Seagull has made it to the shore. One year later, Nancy (now a doctor) and healed after the shark attack, and her sister Chloe go surfing in Galveston, Texas, as their father tells Nancy that her mother would have been proud."
Free State of Jones,"After surviving the 1862 Battle of Corinth and being told of the Twenty Negro Law, Newton Knight, a poor farmer from Jones County serving as a battlefield medic in the Confederate Army, deserts and returns home to his farm and his wife, Serena, after seeing his nephew Daniel get shot and killed. While there, he befriends Rachel, an enslaved woman who has secretly learned to read.
Newton's disenchantment with the Confederacy grows after finding out that troops were taking crops and livestock for taxes. After helping one family resist such a raid, he is pursued by Confederate agents and bitten by an attack dog. With the help of abolitionist-oriented Aunt Sally and multiple slaves, he escapes to a swamp where some runaway slaves led by Moses Washington tend to his wounds.

They raid Confederate convoys and capture a piece of south-east Mississippi, organizing it as the ""Free State of Jones"". Despite getting little help from the Union, they manage to hold out until the end of the war.
Newton continues to fight racial inequality after the war. He helps free Moses' son from an ""apprenticeship"" to Rachel's former master. After Moses is lynched while registering freedmen to vote, Newton participates in a march of voters to the polls while everyone sings John Brown's Body.
Newton and Rachel have a son, Jason. Since they are unable to legally marry, Newton arranges to deed a parcel of land to her. The story is interspersed with the story of Newton's great-grandson, Davis Knight, who is arrested under Mississippi's miscegenation laws in 1948. Since he is possibly of one-eighth black descent, under Mississippi law at that time he is considered black, and therefore could not legally marry his long-time sweetheart. He is sentenced to five years in prison, but his conviction is thrown out by the Mississippi Supreme Court in 1949, rather than risk the law being declared unconstitutional."
The Neon Demon,"Sixteen-year-old aspiring model Jesse has just moved from small-town Georgia to Los Angeles. She meets photographer Dean, who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby, who introduces fellow older models Sarah and Gigi. The three women are intrigued by Jesse's natural beauty and curious about her sexual proclivities. Jesse feigns experience in the latter.
Jesse is signed by Roberta Hoffman, the owner of a modelling agency, who tells her to pretend she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther. Jesse goes on a date with Dean, but keeps his advances at bay. She returns to her motel room to find it ransacked and occupied by a mountain lion. Jesse goes to the photo shoot with Jack, who covers her naked body in gold paint. The shoot is successful, and Gigi and Sarah begin envying Jesse's youth, while Ruby is fascinated with her.
Jesse goes to a casting call for fashion designer Robert Sarno, where Sarah is also present. He pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse. A distraught Sarah asks her how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse admits, ""It's everything."" Sarah lunges toward her, and Jesse accidentally cuts her hand on glass. Sarah immediately sucks the blood from Jesse's hand. Jesse rushes back to her motel and faints, hallucinating strange images. Dean arrives and treats Jesse's wound.
At Sarno's fashion show, Gigi tells Jesse about all the cosmetic surgery she has had done, and expresses disbelief that Jesse has not used casting couches to achieve success. As Jesse is closing the show, she sees a vision of the glowing triangle she saw before in her hallucination. After the show, a visibly-changed Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar. There, Sarno denigrates women who have cosmetic surgery, using a humiliated Gigi as an example. In contrast, he praises Jesse's natural looks. Dean challenges this view and tries to convince Jesse to leave, but she rejects him, now displaying a narcissistic new persona.
Jesse has a nightmare of being forced to sexually swallow a knife. She wakes up in time to hear someone fidgeting with her door lock. She quickly turns the lock, but is left to listen as the intruder breaks into the next room and assaults the female occupant. Terrified, she calls Ruby, who tells her to come over. Ruby tries to initiate sex with her, but Jesse rejects her, revealing herself to be a virgin. Ruby draws a diagram on Jesse's mirror and leaves for her second job as a makeup artist at a morgue, where she pleasures herself with a female corpse.
Ruby returns home and finds Jesse now unabashed in her narcissism. Jesse is attacked by Gigi and Sarah. Ruby pushes Jesse into a huge empty swimming pool, breaking her leg. The three women approach her with knives. Ruby is then seen in a bath full of Jesse's blood; Sarah and Gigi are shown washing blood off in the shower. Later, Ruby is revealed to have occult tattoos. She lies in Jesse's unmarked grave as part of a ritual that culminates in her living room, where a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals.
The next day, Sarah drives Gigi to one of Jack's photoshoots with another model named Annie. Jack wanders to the living room and is suddenly enthralled with Sarah and fires Annie on the spot. In the midst of the shoot, Gigi feels ill and leaves. Sarah watches Gigi vomit up one of Jesse's eyeballs. She screams with regret, ""I need to get her out of me"", and stabs herself with a pair of scissors. Sarah watches Gigi die, eats the regurgitated eyeball, and returns to the photoshoot."
The Legend of Tarzan,"As a result of the Berlin Conference, the Congo Basin is claimed by King Leopold II of the Belgians, who rules the Congo Free State in personal union with the Kingdom of Belgium. The country is on the verge of bankruptcy, Leopold having borrowed huge amounts of money to finance the construction of railways and other infrastructure projects. He sends his envoy Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar. Rom's expedition is ambushed and massacred. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), offers Rom the diamonds in exchange for an old enemy: Tarzan.
The man once called ""Tarzan"", John Clayton III (Alexander Skarsgård), has left Africa behind and settled down in London with his American-born wife, Jane Porter (Margot Robbie), taking up his birth name and ancestral family residence as Lord Greystoke. In the eight years since returning from Africa, John's story as Tarzan has become legendary among the Victorian public, although John himself wishes to leave the past behind him. Through the British Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent), John is invited by King Leopold to visit Boma and report on the development of the Congo by Belgium, though Greystoke declines. An American envoy, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), privately reveals his suspicions that Leopold is enslaving the Congolese population to recoup his debts. Williams persuades John to accept the invitation in order to prove his suspicions. Jane is disappointed when John says that she should not come, as he thinks the trip would be too dangerous, remembering how both his parents died as a result of the jungle's brutality following their shipwreck there — his mother of disease and his father later killed by the Mangani apes — leaving the baby John to be raised as Tarzan by his Mangani ""mother"" Kala and ""brother"" Akut. However, Jane reminds him that she grew up in Africa as well, and misses her home and friends there. John relents, and allows Jane to accompany him.
John, Jane, and Williams take the trip to the Congo. There, the trio encounters a tribal village and villagers who knew John and Jane during their previous stay in the jungle. Jane explains to Williams that her husband was once considered an evil spirit by the African tribes, including that of Chief Mbonga. Jane recalls how, when she was younger, she and her father lived in the tribal village helping to care for local children. There she met Tarzan who was made feral and physically enhanced by his life with the apes. The naked ape man saved Jane's life by shielding her from a vicious mangani attack, suffering severe injuries in the process. Jane took the injured Tarzan home, nursed him back to health, and the two fell in love. That night, as the tribe sleeps, Rom and his mercenaries raid the village and kidnap John and Jane and kill the tribe's leader. They then escape to a nearby steamboat with Jane and several of the tribe's members, but Williams is able to rescue John before he can be taken to the boat.
With the aid of the tribe's warriors, John and Williams intercept a Belgian military train carrying captured slaves, providing Williams with the evidence he needs to expose King Leopold. They also discover that Rom intends to use the diamonds to pay for a massive army to subdue the Congo, and allow Belgium to mine its wealth for Leopold's benefit. As John and Williams continue onward, John encounters the adult Akut, who is now leader of the apes. Aware that Akut considers him a deserter, John prepares to fight Akut, though he soon loses. That night, as John recovers, Williams recalls the massacres of Native Americans during the Indian Wars, comparing to those of Rom and Leopold.
On Rom's steamboat, Jane dines with Rom, before escaping and swimming to shore. Jane stumbles into a group of mangani apes, where she is rescued by Rom, whose men then shoot and kill many of the apes. John saves the remaining group, reconciling with Akut, before pursuing Rom. He is cornered by Mbonga and his tribe, where it is revealed that John once killed Mbonga's only son for previously killing Kala. A defeated Mbonga tearfully accuses John of lacking honor, as his son was just a young boy when John killed him. John spares Mbonga, just as Akut and the manganis arrive to subdue the tribe. Rom takes Jane and the diamonds to Boma, where he plans to take control of the army. John, Williams and Akut trigger a massive stampede of wildebeest through Boma, destroying the town and distracting the soldiers, allowing John to rescue Jane. As Rom attempts to escape by boat, Williams sinks it with a machine gun as John swims aboard. Rom incapacitates John by strangling him and then tying him by the neck to the ship's railing, before trying to escape again. John then summons crocodiles with a mating call to devour Rom, before escaping the destroyed vessel himself.
Williams returns to England and presents the Prime Minister with evidence exposing the slave trade in the African Congo. One year later, John and Jane have remained in Africa and settled in Jane's father's old house. John returns to his rightful place among the great apes as Tarzan and finally actualizes his dream of having a child with Jane."
The BFG,"Sophie, a 10-year-old orphaned girl who lives in a London orphanage, stays awake reading through the nights due to her insomnia. At 3:00 am, or what she calls the ""witching hour"", she sees an elderly giant outside her window. The giant captures her and takes her into Giant Country. There, he explains that Sophie must stay with him for the rest of her life because she saw him and must not be allowed to reveal the existence of giants. He also explains that she will put herself at risk if she goes out in the open, as nine other giants inhabit Giant Country, all of whom are maneaters and favor the taste of children.
When Sophie awakes, the Fleshlumpeater, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants (and the same one from Sophie's nightmare), enters the older giant's home and smells Sophie. The Fleshlumpeater nearly devours Sophie before exiting. The giant gives Sophie some replacement clothes, as hers are ruined, and Sophie convinces him to take her to Dream Country to catch dreams together. As they leave, they accidentally wake up the Bloodbottler, the more intelligent and cunning second-in-command to the Fleshlumpeater, who awakens the other man-eating giants. They torment and bully the friendly giant by throwing him around like a football and rolling him down a hill in a garbage truck. As the pair escape during a thunderstorm which drives the man-eating giants into the cave, the Fleshlumpeater and the Bloodbottler find Sophie's blanket (which she had dropped before) and plan to find her. Climbing up the mountain, Sophie tells the giant that he shouldn't allow the other giants to bully him.
The pair arrives in Dream Country and catch a dream each. While there, the giant reveals that his only other alias (other than ""runt"" which the other giants call him) is ""the Big Friendly Giant"" and Sophie decides to call him ""BFG"". The two then head to London to spread good dreams to sleeping children. As they do so, Sophie realizes that she has lost her blanket. The BFG realizes that the other man-eating giants know about her, and she wakes up outside the orphanage. He explains that the last human child he took and raised was discovered and eaten by Fleshlumpeater's group. She throws herself out of her window in the hope he will appear again to catch her, and he does.
When they return to the BFG's home, the other giants barge in and upend the place looking for Sophie, destroying much of the BFG's hard work. Sophie evades detection and the enraged BFG finally stands up to them and drives them off with a hot fire iron. While hidden, Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG before becoming a victim of Fleshlumpeater's group. She leaves his jacket on his bed and finds a portrait of Queen Victoria amongst his belongings. From this she devises a plan to forge a nightmare and give it to Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom. The nightmare consists of giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing on her windowsill.
They head to Buckingham Palace where upon waking from her nightmare, the Queen and her maid Mary find Sophie on the windowsill as in the nightmare with the BFG outside in the palace grounds. Sophie and the BFG inform the Queen, Mary, and Mr. Tibbs that the child-eating beasts in her dream are indeed real and must be stopped at all costs before they cause any more harm to her subjects. After a large breakfast they all enjoy, the Queen soon dispatches soldiers to Giant Country.
The BFG plans to give the man-eating giants the nightmare Sophie caught the night before, so they will be more compliant once caught. They are almost all immediately consumed by guilt, but the Fleshlumpeater awakens and intercepts the nightmare before it can affect him. Despite this, the British army's helicopters effortlessly ensnare and capture him and the other giants. They are lifted away onto an isolated uncharted island somewhere in the world where numerous snozzcumbers and a large crate of snozzcumber seeds are left with them, much to their fury.
In the aftermath, Sophie begins living in the Queen's palace with Mary while the BFG returns to Giant Country to resume giving dreams to people and begins growing a wide variety of vegetables inspired by his time in England. The film ends with Sophie narrating that whenever she feels lonely, which is less often than before, she talks to him. He can still hear her. Leaning out of her window, she says ""Good Morning, BFG"". At his writing desk, the BFG hears her words and smiles."
The Purge: Election Year,"A young Charlie Roan and her family are tied up by a masked purger. He taunts them with his ""purge playlist"", and then tells them they will play a final purge game called ""Mommy's Choice."" He then proceeds to kill the rest of Charlie's family and leaves her as the only survivor. Eighteen years later, Roan is a U.S. Senator campaigning for the U.S. Presidency, promising to end the annual purge nights. Former police sergeant Leo Barnes is now head of security for Roan. The New Founding Fathers of America's (NFFA) leader, Caleb Warrens and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens, view Roan as a threat and decide to revoke immunity on government officials during the purge.
Watching the presidential debate are deli owner Joe Dixon, his assistant Marcos, and EMT Laney Rucker. A pair of teenage girls enters the store and shoplifts, only to be cornered by Joe. The girls mock Joe until Laney intervenes, at which point they surrender their stolen goods and leave. Joe later receives a phone call stating that his insurance premiums for purge coverage have been raised beyond his affordability. Joe decides to guard his store himself, despite Marcos and Laney's pleas not to.
On the night of the purge, Joe guards his store and is joined by Marcos, and together they manage to repel an attack by the teenage girls. Laney and her partner Dawn patrol the city in an ambulance, providing medical care to the wounded. Roan decides to wait out the purge from her home rather than a secure location to secure the vote, and is accompanied by Barnes, Chief Couper, Eric, and additional security forces. However, a betrayal by Chief Couper and Eric allows a paramilitary force led by Earl Danzinger to kill the security detail and invade the house. Barnes escorts the Senator to safety, but is wounded in the process. He detonates a bomb in the house, killing Eric and Chief Couper.
Barnes and the Senator attempt to seek shelter, but are ambushed by a gang of purgers and taken captive. Before they are executed, Joe and Marcos kill the gang, having seen the pair's plight from the store's rooftop. As they take shelter in the store, the teenage girls return with reinforcements. However, Laney runs over their leader and kills the remaining reinforcements. They form a team and leave for a safer hideout. The team is ambushed by Danzinger in a helicopter, and seeks refuge beneath an overpass wherein Barnes realizes they were tracked by the bullet lodged inside him, and manages to extract it. After a confrontation with a large number of Crips, the team helps their leader's injured comrade. In return, the Crips plant the bullet in another area to divert the paramilitary team, which they later eliminate.
The team arrives at an underground antipurge hideout run by Dante Bishop. Barnes discovers that Bishop's group intends to assassinate Owens, in an effort to end the purge. A large group of paramilitary forces arrives at the hideout looking for Bishop. Barnes and Roan escape back to the streets and meet Joe, Marcos, and Laney, who had left the hideout earlier to return to Joe's store.
While fleeing the city, the ambulance is hit by Danzinger's team. Roan is pulled from the van by the soldiers before Barnes can assist. He leads the group and Bishop's team to a fortified cathedral where the NFFA plans to sacrifice her. Before Roan can be killed by the NFFA, the group arrives and assassinates Warrens, causing a shootout that kills the entire congregation except Owens and another NFFA loyalist, Harmon James, who escape. Owens is caught by Bishop's group, who still intends to kill him, but Roan manages to persuade them to spare him. The remaining paramilitary forces arrive, killing Bishop and his team. Danzinger and Barnes engage in a melee which ends with the former's death. As Roan and the team free the imprisoned purge victims, James emerges and kills a released prisoner. Joe shoots him, but is fatally wounded. Before dying, Joe asks Marcos to take care of his store.
Two months later, Roan wins the election in a landslide, while Barnes is promoted to head of the Secret Service. Marcos and Laney renovate Joe's store and continue to run it in his memory. A news report then states that NFFA supporters have staged violent uprisings across the country in response to election results."
The Secret Life of Pets,"A Jack Russell Terrier named Max lives with his owner Katie in a Manhattan apartment. While she is at work during the day, he hangs out with other pets in the building: tabby cat Chloe, pug Mel, dachshund Buddy, and budgerigar Sweet Pea. One day, Katie adopts Duke, a large mongrel from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her divided focus on Duke. Enraged by Max's attitude towards him, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley, but they are both attacked by cats led by Sphynx cat Ozone who removes both dogs' collars and leaves them to be caught by Animal Control. Duke fears that he will be killed if he goes back to the pound. When Gidget, a white Pomeranian who is (not so) secretly in love with Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.
Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball, the leader of ""The Flushed Pets""—a gang of sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty by allowing a one-fanged viper to bite them, Snowball learns from the cats that Max and Duke are domesticated. The two dogs escape the sewers and board a ferry to Brooklyn, inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.
Meanwhile, Gidget recruits a red-tailed hawk named Tiberius to find Max, but he mistakenly locates Ozone, whom Gidget coerces into telling what he knows about the dogs. They then enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, guinea pig Norman and Sweet Pea. On the way, they meet Pops, an old Basset Hound who helps Gidget and the pets find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke raid a sausage factory for food. Then, Gidget and her team encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidget's team flees.
In the meantime, Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. Max convinces him to visit Fred's house in a nearby neighborhood, confident Fred will still love him and take him back. When they arrive at Fred's house, they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.
While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realizes that he and Max must work together to rescue them. They drive a city bus into the van on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max, unaware of his partnership with Snowball, but Gidget and her team save him. Gidget uses her kung-fu fighting skills, and Max starts to fall in love with her. The van gets stuck in scaffolding and the Flushed Pets escape. As soon as Max gets the keys to Duke's cage, the van plummets into the East River with him inside. Max is unable to free Duke, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve the keys, allowing them to escape the sinking van.
The entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven taxi. Max expresses his love for Gidget, who returns his affection. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a little girl named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball and the remaining Flushed Pets return to the sewers. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become a domesticated pet. The other pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, and Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship.
Buddy and Mel show up in costume at a party in poodle Leonard's apartment. Leonard's owner returns and Tattoo crashes to the floor on the chandelier."
Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,"Brothers Mike and Dave Stangle are liquor salesmen whose antics ruin their family's gatherings. With their younger sister Jeanie's wedding in Hawaii approaching, their parents tell them they must bring dates to the wedding to keep them out of trouble. Mike and Dave put out an ad for dates on Craigslist. The ad goes viral and the brothers go on The Wendy Williams Show to advertise themselves.
Meanwhile, Tatiana and Alice are slacker party girls who have just been fired for showing up to their waitressing jobs drunk. Tatiana sees the brothers' appearance on TV and decides that this free trip is just the vacation they need. They clean themselves up and Tatiana, to get their attention, throws herself in front of a moving car outside the bar where the brothers are meeting women. After letting the brothers think Mike saved Tatiana's life, they all go on a date. Tatiana, posing as a school teacher, flirts with Mike but has no intention of having sex with him. Alice, who is pretending to be a hedge fund manager, thinks sleeping with Dave is just what she needs to get over her ex-fiance, who left her at the altar. Thinking their family will like these girls, the brothers invite them to Hawaii.
In Hawaii, Tatiana and Alice charm the Stangle family but are almost exposed when Alice, suffering PTSD-like flashbacks of her own wedding, gets drunk and makes jealous, offhanded comments to Jeanie. At the same time Mike and his bisexual female cousin, Terry, begin competing for Tatiana's attention. The brothers book a swim-with-dolphins package for the family; however, the girls convince Jeanie and her fiance, Eric, to take an ATV tour through the mountains instead. Alice and Tatiana show off and perform tricks on their ATVs. Mike attempts the same trick but ends up crashing into Jeanie and severely bruising her face. Alice feels bad and bribes a masseur to give Jeanie a massage with a tantric style ""happy ending"".
Tatiana goes into a sauna and runs into Terry. She offers Tatiana backstage passes to Rihanna if Tatiana fingers her. Dave finds himself falling for Alice and opens up to her about his dream of drawing full-time. Later Mike walks in on Jeanie having an orgasm during the massage. Upon finding Tatiana and Terry together, Mike storms off and Tatiana admits she was only interested in the free vacation. At the rehearsal dinner, Jeanie opens up to Alice about her fears about getting married. To help calm her nerves, Alice gives her ecstasy, which causes a bad trip. Mike drags Dave backstage and demands he practice their speech instead of spending more time with Alice. They get into an argument, and Mike reveals what happened in the massage parlor - unaware that they are being broadcast over the speaker system. The argument gets physical in front of the entire wedding party.
Jeanie and Alice take off their clothes and release a stable of horses. After yelling at Alice, Dave gets them both back to the resort, where Jeanie and Eric (who gets mad about the massage) get into an argument and call off the wedding. The next day, the brothers make up and agree to work together to get the wedding back on track. At the same time, Tatiana and Alice feel guilty and also agree to fix the wedding. All four of them go to Jeanie and Eric's room to apologize, which ends in an argument. Eric silences and berates all of them, and gives Jeanie an early honeymoon present: tickets for a hot air balloon ride, even though Eric is afraid of heights. With the wedding back on, the four scramble to get a venue for the reception and food for dinner. Jeanie and Eric end up getting married outside the stables. After the wedding, Tatiana and Mike decide to get into business together. Alice deletes her wedding video before making out with Dave in front of everyone. The brothers perform a heartfelt duet to celebrate Jeanie's marriage. Alice and Tatiana then join them for a raunchy dance number. The fireworks display the brothers set off catches fire, scattering the wedding party. Tatiana and Mike later have sex in the stables."
Characterz,"The story begins in medias res with Tucker being arrested while in costume, and then the bulk of the rest of the story is told as a buildup to that event.
Tucker Ostrowski recently graduated from a college in central Florida with an Associate of Arts degree, and is accepted to California Institute of the Arts, as he wants to go into music creation, animation, or theme park design. However, his parents recently filed for personal bankruptcy, so he cannot count on their money to pay for tuition. So, he needs to get a job to pay his own way, but has a criminal record because of a charge of vandalism in his teenage years. He just has to do community service, and expect it to be expunged from his record in two months, but the big parks in the area all do background checks. He looks into other jobs without success before finding that the amusement park Old Time Fun Town is hiring.
He goes to the theme park and is accepted on the spot from Mr. Lloyd, the hiring manager, with literally no questions asked, and Tucker isn't even sure what job he has accepted at first. He finds he has accepted a job as a theme park mascot, Hoppy the Kangaroo, and immediately meets two-week-long veteran Jerry, a former high school mascot performer, who is working as Cap'n Jack's Parrot. Given the low budget nature of the park, Tucker is sent out to interact with the patrons immediately. With no training, he finds he has to learn the job as he goes, but finds that he is enjoying the work regardless. At lunchtime, Tucker meets Stu, who performs as Paws the Pink Polar Bear. Tucker, Stu, and Jerry discuss park operations. The park general manager, Benjamin Fletcher, is a vaguely shady but oddly affable manager who knows all the employees by name. It's also well-known that he plays poker with some ""notorious types"" but Tucker is grateful for the job and thinks nothing of it.
The second day on the job, before starting work, Jerry and Tucker watch news but ignore mention of a string of daring daylight robberies where the perpetrators are ""elaborately disguised."" Jerry has to go off to advertise for the park before it opens and relieve Sam, who comes to the break room dressed as Bowser the Bulldog. Tucker helps Sam get out of costume and is surprised to learn that Sam is short for Samantha, not Samuel as he assumed. Sam works part time at the park, and her other job is working at the Haven House.
Mr. Fletcher wants to address the entire staff. He informs the park staff that when he joined park management the previous summer, he promised to increase attendance and profits by offering quality games, rides, food, and merchandise. The end result was that the park had about the same attendance as the year before. He hopes to get attendance and profits up through entertainment. The park was successful when Hoppy was first introduced 15 years before, but the original performer died 12 years ago and the character was retired, and there were no costumed performers in the park since. Fletcher says that he plans to boost attendance by reintroducing Hoppy and several other costumed performers. He then reveals that in addition to the four characters based on off-the-shelf costumes purchased from MaskUS, Inc., he has had the in-house art director Don Cluff design a large custom-made ""Doby Mick"" blue whale costume to support their marketing push.
However, the costume proves too large and unwieldy for the current four performers, so Benjamin Fletcher pulls in a favor and gets Franklin Jefferson Washington to wear the costume. He was a professional basketball player that got injured, then became the team's mascot, then was poached by Disney to play one of their tall characters, and then retired from that to start his own delivery business, likely selling drugs. The new character is a big hit with crowds and a huge draw. A few days later at Old Time Fun Town, the park employees practice for a Fourth of July parade. When it comes to the actual parade, it is extremely lackluster and takes less than a minute to pass.
After a hard day at work, Sam suggests that Tucker visit her at her other job at the Haven House and get a new perspective on the job. He finds that the house is a haven for retired people with various health and mental problems who cannot live independently. One of the people at the home is Lyle, a reclusive old man. Tucker is left alone with him and in attempting to strike up a conversation, he explains that he costumes as a kangaroo. Lyle explains that he was ""attacked by a kangaroo two nights ago"" who came up to him while he was at an ATM and robbed him of $400.
A few days later at the Haven House, Tucker shows Sam several rough animations he has made. Sam tells Tucker she got accepted into an adult-gerontological nurse practitioner program in Los Angeles. Tucker still wants to go to California Institute of the Arts, but is still extremely far from that goal financially. He explains why he wants to go there, and excitedly explains his plans. Sam points out that the seniors at Haven House never feel the sort of joy most people feel at an amusement park anymore, as their health problems severely limit their mobility.
Soon after, back at work Tucker learns Sam is spending a week in California to tour the campus. Stu is going to a cosplay convention over the weekend, leaving just Tucker and Jerry to cover the park schedule. Tucker has to cover for Stu for an offsite event at a private party that specifically requested the bird and polar bear costumes. Tucker is wary of covering for him, as Stu is known to be the sweatiest of the group, and Paws the Pink Polar Bear reeks even after intense cleaning, and Tucker won't have time to even attempt to clean it. Tucker and Jerry arrive at the party and are told that all they have to do are greet the guests. They both learn that it's actually a furry party, and after they are done greeting guests, check around back to see what goes on at that sort of party. They are surprised to find it is a very tame and normal party. Back in the car, they see a police car speeding past, and checking the radio and find that the sixth in a string of robberies occurred, with this one being a bank heist.
In Tucker's free time, Tucker has started a personal project of creating entertainment for the seniors at the Haven House, despite his parents having pawned or sold almost all their tools. Tucker buys new power tools, but as his parents’ financial situation becomes even more dire, his parents lose electricity, leaving him to attempt work by himself with hand tools. Tucker lets Jerry in on his plan, and he suggests getting help from the landscaping crew. They agree to help, and suggest using a large variety of construction supplies and old props that Old Time Fun Town has had in storage for decades. Tucker and Jerry also find the original head of Hoppy, and backup costumes for the rest of the characters, including Paws the Polar Bear. When Sam returns from her trip and goes to the Haven House, Tucker reveals that he designed and helped build a Tunnel of Love for the seniors, designed to be ridden in wheel chairs.
The next day while working Tucker is arrested in costume, as well as Jerry, Sam, and Stu. They all assume that they are arrested for borrowing the items from the warehouse, as they did not inform Benjamin Fletcher of their plan. When they are questioned at the station, the detective shows them videos from the recent crime spree, which show people dressed in their same costumes committing robberies. However, all of their alibis check out and they are free to go, except for Stu, who is kept for further questioning and released later.
Jerry suspects that the people in the costumes worked for park operations. Tucker, Jerry, and Sam know that if they can get the backup costumes from the park's warehouse to the police, the police can test the sweat in the costumes. Since none of them have worn those sets of costumes, they can get the sweat in the costumes matched to the park employees to discover whoever was trying to use them as patsies to be blamed for the crimes. However, Tucker, Jerry, and Sam suspect that the warehouse will be watched closely, and enlist the help of the seniors from the Haven House to help distract park operations so they can remove the costumes from the warehouse. However, despite the distractions, half of park operations is already there, about to take the duplicate costumes to the incinerator. Jerry reveals that Stu told Benjamin Fletcher of his suspicions, but Mr. Fletcher arrives and reveals that he was the mastermind behind the whole plan, and park operations engaged with the crimes with his blessings so he could take a cut of the money, though bank robbing was too extreme for him. The park operations employees approach Tucker, Jerry, and Sam to restrain them, but George the Janitor arrives and beats them back. The police detective enters and stops the fight. The entire park operations team is taken in for questioning, as well as Benjamin Fletcher. The police also take the costumes as evidence, so the performers make do by buying other off the shelf costumes or borrowing them from friends, though Tucker is able to use the original Hoppy the Kangaroo costume, as that one wasn’t worn by anyone in 12 years.
After the summer is over, Stu starts a furry cosplay costume company and brings on Tucker's parents as sales agents. Jerry gets a promotion to director of entertainment at the park and the next summer creates a hit musical on Fletcher's old stage.

The Infiltrator,"During the 1980s, U.S. Customs Service special agent Robert Mazur uses his undercover alias ""Bob Musella"" to become a pivotal player for drug lords cleaning their dirty cash. Later, he infiltrates the world's largest cartel and helps expose the money-laundering organization of drug lord Pablo Escobar[4] and take down the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which had secretly taken illegal ownership of First American Bank shares in Washington, D.C. He survives the deception and has a long and productive career."
Ghostbusters,"Physicists Abby Yates and Erin Gilbert are authors of a research book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomena, such as ghosts. While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at Columbia University, disowned the work, fearing it will impact her tenure. When Abby republishes the book, Erin convinces her to agree to remove the book from publication in exchange by helping Abby and Jillian in a paranormal investigation. They witness a malevolent ghost, restoring Erin's belief in the paranormal, but video footage of the investigation is posted online, and Erin is fired by the university. She joins Abby and Jillian to set up new offices above a Chinese restaurant, calling themselves ""Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination"". They build equipment to study and capture ghosts, and hire the dimwitted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a receptionist.
MTA staffer Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group. They document the ghost and successfully test Jillian's proton containment laser, but their findings are again dismissed. They continue to develop their technology and advertise their services with the name pundits have labeled them, ""Ghostbusters"". Patty joins the team, providing historical knowledge of New York City and a repurposed hearse, ""Ecto-1"".
Unbeknownst to the Ghostbusters, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an occultist attempting to bring about the apocalypse. When Rowan plants another device at a live music venue, the Ghostbusters are called in and capture the ghost in front of the audience. When supernatural debunker Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the Ghostbusters, the incensed Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws Heiss out a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that the city and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are aware of New York's ghost problem. While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office and the DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters.
The Ghostbusters realize that Rowan is planting his devices along ley lines, which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in Times Square, a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement. To avoid capture, Rowan commits suicide by electrocuting himself, after which Jillian deactivates the portal. Erin discovers a copy of her and Abby's book among Rowan's possessions and realizes that he killed himself so he could become a ghost and command a spirit army. Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Abby and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.
Rowan takes the form of the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to enormous height, and attacks the city. The team devises a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him; Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her as Rowan is obliterated. The mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds. With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility, a disused fire house. New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters. Patty listens to a recording of a ghost encounter and asks the others if they have heard of Zuul."
Star Trek Beyond,"Three years into its mission, the USS Enterprise arrives at Yorktown, a massive space station, for resupply and shore leave for her crew. Struggling to find meaning in their endless exploration, Captain James T. Kirk has applied for a promotion to vice admiral; he recommends Spock as his replacement. Meanwhile, Hikaru Sulu reunites with his family, Montgomery Scott works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and Nyota Uhura amicably end their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock, his counterpart from the original timeline, has died.
The Enterprise is dispatched on a rescue mission after an escape pod drifts out of a nearby uncharted nebula. The occupant, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet within the nebula. As the Enterprise exits an asteroid field within the nebula, a massive swarm of small ships ambushes and quickly overwhelms the starship. The leader of the swarm, Krall, and his crew board the crippled Enterprise and unsuccessfully search for a relic, the Abronath, that Kirk had recently obtained. Krall captures and removes many crewmembers from the ship; he also has his swarm cut the Enterprise into pieces. Kirk orders the crew to abandon ship, leaving the remains of the Enterprise to crash on Altamid.
On the planet, Krall captures Sulu, Uhura, and other survivors. Kirk and Pavel Chekov, accompanied by Kalara, locate the Enterprise's saucer section; realising that Kalara knew they would be attacked, they trick her into revealing herself as Krall's spy. To escape Krall's soldiers, Kirk and Chekov use the ship's thrusters to flip the saucer over, crushing Kalara. Elsewhere on the planet, a wounded Spock and Dr. Leonard McCoy search for other survivors; Spock explains to McCoy that the tension he witnessed between him and Uhura at the Yorktown base was due to his intention to leave Starfleet to help the Vulcan survivors, and continue the late Ambassador Spock's work. Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment, rescues Scott and takes him to her makeshift home, the grounded USS Franklin, an early Starfleet vessel reported missing over a century earlier. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy and Spock. Threatening to kill the crew, Krall coerces Ensign Syl to hand over the Abronath that she had kept hidden for Kirk, then dissolves her completely using the Abronath, the missing half of an ancient bioweapon that can disintegrate any humanoid. With the device complete, Krall intends to attack Yorktown and kill its inhabitants before going on to attack the Federation. Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches into space with the bioweapon, leading his drones to Yorktown.
As the Enterprise survivors power up the Franklin and launch her back into space in pursuit of Krall, they deduce that such a massive swarm must coordinate its attacks via radio signals, specifically on the FM frequency. Scott transports Spock and McCoy into one of the swarm ships to seize control of one. Matching the swarm's frequency, they jam and disorient the swarm by broadcasting the 1994 song ""Sabotage"" by the Beastie Boys over the channels, destroying almost the entire fleet. Krall and his three surviving ships, one of whom contains Spock and McCoy, are chased by the Franklin through Yorktown, ending at the stations headquarters when the Franklin slams into the ships. As Krall flees into the starbase, Uhura and Kirk discover from the Franklin's logs that he is actually Balthazar Edison, former captain of the Franklin. A pre-Federation human soldier, Edison rejected the Federation's principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies like the Xindi. When he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the three survivors used the technology of the planet's extinct natives to prolong their lives at the cost of the others and re-purposed their dormant drone workers into the swarm. Thinking that the Federation had abandoned them, Edison now plans to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into Yorktown's ventilation system, where Edison activates the bioweapon. Before it can be unleashed, Kirk ejects Edison and the bioweapon out of Yorktown and into space where the weapon consumes Edison. Using the alien ship they had commandeered, Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into space.
In the aftermath, Commodore Paris closes the unsolved cases of Captain Edison and the USS Franklin crew. Kirk decides to remain as a captain while Spock chooses to remain in Starfleet and begins to renew his relationship with Uhura. Jaylah has been accepted into Starfleet Academy on Kirk's recommendation. As the crew celebrates Kirk's birthday, together they watch the progress of the completion of their new ship, the USS Enterprise-A, and on the ship's completion, they resume their mission."
Ice Age: Collision Course,"Scrat, trying to bury his acorn, accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several asteroids en route to a collision with Earth. Meanwhile, Manny is worried about the upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé, Julian. Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family, but their fierce appearance tends to scare kids. Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her, and he laments his solitude. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party (which Manny had forgotten prior to the event), some of the asteroids strike the place and The Herd barely escape with their lives. Meanwhile, at the underground cavern, Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen by a trio of flying dromaeosaurs[7] named Gavin, Gertie, and Roger. Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface, where he meets Manny and the others.
Buck explains to The Herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation, and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them, believing that they could be safe from the impact, as they can fly, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species. Roger is reluctant, but Gavin and Gertie strong-arm him into cooperating.
As The Herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties. Buck theorizes that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs, The Herd arrives at ""Geotopia"", a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity. Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with, immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone-like appearances.
Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and The Herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away. The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, but Buck convinces Roger that they will not be able to survive the asteroid, and he in turn convinces Gavin and Gertie to help. The plan works, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The Herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid's grandmother, who stayed behind with them, regain their youth. After The Herd returns, Manny reconciles with Julian, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.
In the film's epilogue, Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on Mars, destroying all life on the planet.
In a mid-credits scene, Scrat finds his acorn, but gets beaten by some doors."
Lights Out,"In a textile factory, an employee named Esther encounters a silhouette of a woman when the lights are off, but cannot see it when the lights are on. She warns her boss Paul. He also encounters the woman and notes that she will not come into the light. He is killed by the woman after she chases him through the factory.
A short time later, a young woman named Rebecca is called into the school nurse’s office of her brother, Martin. Rebecca and Martin are half-siblings, sharing the same mom: Sophie. The nurse was unable to get in touch with Sophie to inform her that Martin has been falling asleep in class lately. An official from Child Protective Services questions Rebecca about Martin’s living conditions. Rebecca tells the official Sophie has depression, and is taking antidepressants. Rebecca also tells the official Paul was her stepfather, and that her real father ran away when she was a child.
Rebecca and her boyfriend, Bret, take Martin to Sophie’s house. Martin tells Rebecca that Sophie has been talking to a woman named “Diana”. Rebecca assures Martin that Diana isn’t a real person, and that she had also heard Sophie talk to the imaginary Diana when she was a child. Rebecca gets in an argument with Sophie when she realizes her mom is not taking her medication, so she takes Martin to her apartment so he can rest.
That night, Rebecca is woken by the same woman that killed Paul after she notices her scratching at the floor. Rebecca narrowly escapes an attack from the woman when she turns the lights on and the woman disappears. The next morning, Rebecca notices the word “Diana” has been scratched into her floor, along with a stick figure drawing of a woman. Rebecca has a flashback to when she found the same name and drawing as a child, and realizes Diana is real.
While her mom is running errands, Rebecca sneaks into Sophie's house and finds a box of medical records and other research in Paul’s office. Paul's findings reveal that Sophie was admitted to a mental hospital as a child. While there, she befriended a young patient named Diana. Diana suffered a severe skin condition, and was accidentally killed by the hospital staff when they performed surgery on her under intense light. Rebecca also learns that Diana was admitted to the mental hospital after her dad committed suicide, and that it was believed that Diana was able to ""get into people's heads"".
Rebecca, Bret, and Martin stage an intervention at Sophie’s house about how Diana’s spirit is haunting them all. Sophie becomes irate, says she won’t abandon her friend, then locks herself in her bedroom. The team decides to stay the night at Sophie’s, intending to get her help in the morning. To avoid an attack from Diana during the night, they rig the house to be as brightly lit as possible. This proves to be useless when Diana cuts the power to the neighborhood. Diana traps Rebecca and Martin in the basement, and attempts to kill Bret. Bret escapes Diana, and drives to get help from the police. In the basement, Rebecca finds a black light while searching for light sources to brighten the basement. When Rebecca clearly sees Diana with the black light, she realizes it’s not powerful enough to harm her.
Bret returns with two police officers. The officers free Martin and Rebecca from the basement, only to be murdered by Diana. As they’re fleeing the house, Rebecca remembers Sophie is still in her bedroom. As she climbs the stairs to retrieve her mom, Diana tells Rebecca that she killed Rebecca’s father years ago. Diana throws Rebecca off the second floor landing. As Diana prepares to kill Rebecca, Sophie appears, with a gun from one of the dead officers. Sophie realizes she is the tether for Diana to exist in the real world, and commits suicide. As Sophie falls to the floor, Diana vanishes.
Later, Bret comforts Martin and Rebecca in an ambulance outside of Sophie’s house. The three of them appear to be slightly spooked when the ambulance lights flicker."
Jason Bourne,"A decade after he exposed Operation Blackbriar (as seen in The Bourne Ultimatum) and disappeared, Jason Bourne has finally recovered from his amnesia, isolating himself from the world and making a living by taking part in savage, bareknuckle fighting bouts. In Reykjavík, Nicky Parsons, who has been collaborating with a hacktivist group led by Christian Dassault, hacks into the CIA's mainframe computer server to expose its ""black"" (top-secret) operations programs. This alerts Heather Lee, the head of the agency's cybersecurity operations division, and CIA director Robert Dewey. In the process, Parsons finds documentation concerning Bourne's recruitment into Treadstone and his father's role in the program. She travels to Athens to find and inform him.
In Greece, Parsons and Bourne meet at Syntagma Square during a violent anti-government protest. They evade CIA teams sent after them, but Parsons is shot by the Asset, an ex-Blackbriar assassin who also holds a personal grudge against Bourne, having been captured and tortured as an unintentional consequence of Bourne's exposure of Blackbriar. Before she dies, Parsons passes Bourne the key to a locker which holds the CIA files.
Seeking answers about his past and family, Bourne locates Dassault in Berlin. Decrypting Parsons' files, Bourne discovers that his father, Richard Webb, was a CIA analyst involved in the creation of the Treadstone program. A ""malware"" program implanted in the files gives the CIA Bourne's location, and Dewey sends a team to capture him, while Lee remotely erases the files. Dassault attacks Bourne, but is killed. Lee alerts Bourne to the team closing in, as she believes that he can be persuaded to return to the agency. Using the few leads he gathered in Berlin, Bourne tracks Malcolm Smith, a former Treadstone surveillance operative, in London and arranges to meet him in Paddington Plaza.
Lee persuades Dewey's boss, Edwin Russell, the Director of National Intelligence, to allow her to contact Bourne in person to attempt to bring him back in. Dewey, who opposes her plan, secretly authorizes the Asset to eliminate her team and kill Bourne. Bourne evades Lee and the Asset long enough to confront Smith. Smith admits that Richard Webb created Treadstone, but tried to prevent them from recruiting his son. Under Dewey's orders, the Asset killed Richard Webb in Beirut, making it look like a terrorist attack, in order to persuade Bourne to join Treadstone. Smith is killed by the Asset, while Bourne escapes and finds Lee. She admits that she is not comfortable with Dewey's methods and directs Bourne to a technology convention in Las Vegas.
Dewey is scheduled to attend the convention for a public debate on privacy rights with Aaron Kalloor, CEO of social media giant Deep Dream. Kalloor is the public face of corporate social responsibility in the Internet age, but he was secretly funded by Dewey in the startup stage. Dewey intends to use Deep Dream for real-time mass surveillance alongside the latest incarnation of the CIA's targeted assassination 'Beta' program, known as ""Iron Hand"". When Kalloor has second thoughts about giving the CIA access to Deep Dream, Dewey authorizes the Asset to assassinate Kalloor and Lee. Bourne thwarts the assassinations and confronts Dewey in his suite. Dewey appeals to Bourne's sense of patriotism as he stalls for time. Bourne kills Jeffers, Dewey's right-hand man, and Lee kills Dewey before he can shoot Bourne. Bourne covers up Lee's involvement before chasing the Asset on the Las Vegas Strip and finally killing him during a brutal hand-to-hand fight.
In the aftermath, Lee convinces Russell that Dewey's methods were outdated and offers herself as Dewey's replacement as CIA director and Russell's eyes and ears within the CIA. She outlines her plan to use Bourne's trust to bring him back to the agency, but is prepared to kill him if he refuses. Lee meets with Bourne, promising him that the CIA will become the organization he thought it was when he joined. Bourne asks for time to consider her offer and walks away. Lee returns to her car and finds a recording, made by Bourne, of the conversation she had with Russell about bringing Bourne in."
Bad Moms,"Amy Mitchell (Mila Kunis) is a married woman in the Chicago suburbs with two children, Jane (Oona Laurence) and Dylan (Emjay Anthony), who feels overworked and overcommitted. She works as a sales rep for a ""hip"" coffee company, prepares healthful, hand-packed lunches for her children, does most of their homework, goes to all of their extracurricular activities, and is active in her school's PTA, run by the domineering Gwendolyn James (Christina Applegate) and her cronies, Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Vicky (Annie Mumolo). When she catches her husband Mike (David Walton) cheating on her with a camgirl, Amy kicks him out and attempts to keep everything together.
After a particularly stressful day, Amy publicly quits the PTA in response to Gwendolyn's overzealous bake sale plans. At a nearby bar, Amy meets Carla (Kathryn Hahn), a laid-back, sexually active single mom, and Kiki (Kristen Bell), a stay-at-home mom of four who adores Amy's dissent from Gwendolyn. Amy and Carla are irritated to discover that Kiki's husband is domineering and expects her to take care of all the kids and the house with no assistance whatsoever, while Amy and Kiki are disturbed at Carla's very hands-off approach to parenting. The trio embark on an all-night bender that inspires Amy to loosen up with her kids: she takes them for rides in Mike's classic car, gets them lunch from Arby's, forces Dylan to fend for himself to prevent him from being lazy and entitled, and takes the overachieving and constantly stressed Jane for a spa day. Amy herself decides to start dating but finds herself inexperienced due to her early marriage and motherhood. She ultimately ends up striking a connection with Jessie (Jay Hernandez), a handsome widower at the school who's had a crush on her.
After Amy brings store-bought donut holes to the bake sale, she draws the ire of Gwendolyn, who uses her PTA authority to get Jane benched from the soccer team. Amy is angered, and decides to run for PTA president in opposition to Gwendolyn. A meet-and-greet at Amy's home draws only one visitor, who informs them that Gwendolyn has launched a rival party at her own house, catered by Martha Stewart. In spite of this, the other moms, and Martha, swiftly abandon Gwendolyn's party when it becomes clear that she intends to lecture them all evening, leading to a successful party at Amy's house.
Gwendolyn responds by putting drugs in Jane's locker, which gets her kicked out of all extracurricular activities. Jane and Dylan both go to stay with Mike (who has agreed to an amicable divorce) in response to what they see as Amy's failure as a mom. Amy loses her job because her boss refuses to understand her reasons for taking time off.
A despondent Amy stays home during the PTA election but is roused into action by Carla and Kiki, who finally stands up to her husband and orders him to deal with everything alone until the meeting is over. At the event, Amy gives an inspiring speech about how all the moms are overworked and that they need to take time off, do fewer and less stressful events, and most importantly, allow themselves to make mistakes. Amy wins by a landslide and eventually winds up comforting a devastated Gwendolyn, who reveals that her life is not perfect like she claims it is and that being in charge of the PTA was her only way to take her anger out on the problems she is facing.
Some weeks later, Amy's approach has led to positive changes: Jane has been reinstated to the soccer team and is stressing out less, Dylan is actually applying himself, Kiki makes her husband help out with taking care of their kids, Carla is more responsible and hands-on, and all of the other moms, including Stacy and Vicky, are feeling more energized. Amy herself has gotten her job back with much better compensation after her boss sees how much he had taken her for granted, and she continues to see Jessie. Gwendolyn invites Amy, Carla, and Kiki for a day of fun on her husband's private jet.
The ending credits play over the cast interviewing their real-life moms."
Nerve,"High school senior Venus ""Vee"" Delmonico longs to leave her home in Staten Island for college, but is afraid to tell her mother about being admitted to the California Institute of the Arts, as she is still grieving from the death of her brother, who died before starting college. Her friend Sydney becomes popular in Nerve: an online reality game where people either enlist online as ""players"" or pay to watch as ""watchers"". Players accept dares from watchers, receiving monetary rewards. Sydney and her other friends chastise Vee's unadventurous nature. When Vee refuses to talk to her crush J.P., Sydney approaches J.P. herself and reveals that Vee is interested in him. J.P. rebuffs her, and Vee walks away embarrassed.
Furious, Venus signs up as a player on Nerve. The game collects her personal data and explains the three rules: all dares must be recorded on the player's phone, earned money will be revoked if a player fails or ""bails"" a dare, and a player must not report the game to law enforcement. In addition, the top two most-watched players will compete in a highly sought-after final round. Her first dare is to kiss a stranger at a diner for five seconds. Vee kisses Ian, who is reading Vee's favorite book To the Lighthouse by Virginia Woolf. He starts dancing around the diner and sings to her on a dare, revealing that he's another player. The watchers then dare Ian to take her into New York City, believing they make a good couple.
In the city, Vee is dared to try on an expensive dress. Ian is also dared to try on formal attire. Vee and Ian find that their clothes have been stolen, and are dared by the watchers to leave the store. They do so in their underwear. They return to Ian's motorbike, where they find a bag of clothes paid for by watchers. Vee is then dared to get a tattoo chosen by Ian, who draws out a tattoo and refuses to show Vee. When Vee becomes impatient, he distracts her with Wu-Tang Clan's ""C.R.E.A.M."" on the radio, one of her brother's favorite songs. Vee raps along with the song until the finished tattoo is revealed to be a lighthouse. Ian's next dare is to ride his motorbike through the city blindfolded at 60 mph, using Vee to steer his body; once completed, the two kiss. Vee and Ian soon become among Nerve's top players.
Jealous at Vee's rise of popularity, Sydney accepts a dare to walk across a ladder suspended between two buildings. Whilst performing the dare, she drops her phone and becomes terrified. Sydney bails out and loses the game. Ian takes Vee to Sydney's party and Vee catches her in bed with J.P. After arguing with Sydney, Vee receives and completes the dare on which Sydney bailed. Vee's friend Tommy reveals that he was watching Ian's profile; Ian had accepted a dare to make Vee and Sydney fight. Vee realizes how dangerous Nerve is and reports the game to the police, but they do nothing. As punishment, all of the money is depleted from Vee and her mother's bank accounts. She is then punched in the face by elite player Ty as a dare.
After waking up in an abandoned site, she finds Ian, who confesses that he and Ty were players whose friend, Robbie, was killed in a dare. When they tried to alert the authorities, their families' jobs, bank accounts, and identities were confiscated, trapping them in the secret third category of the game: ""prisoners"". Vee is now a prisoner too, and only the winner of the final round can regain their identity.
Vee, Tommy, and Sydney recruit Tommy's hacker friends to alter the game's online code, but it is impossible to shut down Nerve as all the watchers act as a server to the game. After hanging from a crane for five seconds - the same dare that killed Robbie - Ian earns a spot in the finals in order to protect Vee. During the finals, which take place at Battery Weed on Staten Island, Vee and Ian are each given a revolver: one must shoot the other to win. Ian offers to throw the competition, but Ty jumps from the audience and takes his place. Vee criticizes the watchers, whose identity are concealed behind masks and tells them to show ""nerve"" at who they are and reveal themselves. The watchers then cast a vote regarding if Ty should kill Vee. The majority vote is ""yes"", and Ty shoots Vee.
Tommy and his hackers modify Nerve's source code to decrypt the watcher's code names and send them a message: ""You are an accessory to murder"". All watchers immediately log out of Nerve, closing down the game's servers and effectively ending it once and for all. Vee is unharmed; she and Ty had staged her murder to scare the watchers into disbanding Nerve. Everyone's money and identities are restored. A few months later, Vee and Sydney have reconciled, Vee and Ian are a couple, and Vee is attending California Arts. Ian reveals that his real name is Sam. The movie ends off with a kiss between Ian and Vee, with someone holding their phone videotaping it."
Suicide Squad,"In the aftermath of Superman's death, intelligence officer Amanda Waller reaches Washington D.C for assembling Task Force X, and shows them to everyone in the White House a team of dangerous criminals imprisoned at Belle Reve Prison consisting of elite hitman Deadshot, former psychiatrist Harley Quinn, pyrokinetic ex-gangster El Diablo, opportunistic thief Captain Boomerang, genetic mutation Killer Croc, and specialized assassin Slipknot. They are placed under command of Colonel Rick Flag to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a nano bomb implanted in their neck, designed to detonate should any member rebel or try to escape.
One of Waller's intended recruits is Flag's girlfriend Dr. June Moone, an archaeologist possessed by a witch known as the ""Enchantress"". Enchantress quickly turns on Waller, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon for imprisoning her. She besieges Midway City by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is Katana, a Japanese swordswoman.
Harley's homicidal lover Joker finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nano bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harley's bomb. On approach, the squad's helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang inaccurately convinces Slipknot that the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check; Slipknot attempts to escape and Flag kills him via his nano bomb, while the squad is attacked by Enchantress' minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe room, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress' siege.
The squad escorts Waller to a rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad while Harley climbs aboard upon Dr. Van Criss disarming her bomb, leaving Flag unable to execute her. However, Waller's men shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Waller's whereabouts, Enchantress' minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Waller's confidential files and learns the truth about Enchantress. Flag is then forced to confess the truth, causing the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission, but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of Navy SEALs, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.
The remaining squad members battle Enchantress together, but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress' heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress' weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress' heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences. All but Captain Boomerang are allowed special privileges. The Joker, alive and unscathed, breaks into the penitentiary and rescues Harley.
In a mid-credits scene, Waller meets with Bruce Wayne, who agrees to protect her from the backlash against her role in Enchantress' rampage in exchange for access to the government's files on the expanding metahuman community while telling her to shut down Task Force X."
Nine Lives,"Tom Brand (Kevin Spacey) is a major business tycoon in New York City whose workaholic attitude ruined his first marriage with Madison (Cheryl Hines) and caused a rift between him and his adult son David (Robbie Amell) who now works for him and strives for his approval. He now lives with his second wife Lara (Jennifer Garner), who is a little more tolerant of the fact that he is never at home, and his daughter Rebecca (Malina Weissman). His eponymous company FireBrand is nearing completion on its greatest achievement to date: the tallest skyscraper in the northern hemisphere that will be the new headquarters. In the opening scene, he skydives out of a plane and lands on the top of the new skyscraper. His son, who is his assistant, remains in the plane, refusing to jump.
Rebecca's 11th birthday is coming and she has always wanted a cat, but Tom has always refused as he hates cats. Not wanting to disappoint her, he rushes to get a last-minute present for his daughter's birthday, but as he is distracted, the GPS redirects him to a mysterious pet store called Purrkins Pet Shop, brimming with odd and exotic cats. The store's eccentric owner Felix Perkins (Christopher Walken) tells him he does not pick the cat, the cat picks him. The tomcat that picked him is called Mr. Fuzzypants. Perkins says he has used up seven of his nine lives. Tom takes the cat. Tom is on his way home for the party when he decides to see Ian Cox (Mark Consuelos), one of the top managers of the company in charge of the new building, and learns that another building in Chicago will be taller. They have an argument while on the roof that ends with Brand firing Cox, but lightning strikes the antenna. Brand is blown off the building along with the cat, and without any effort from Cox to save him, he plummets off the side of the skyscraper, but his leg gets snagged on some stray equipment and gets flung back inside through a window as he passes out. When he wakes up, he realizes that his human body is in the hospital in a state of coma, and his consciousness is trapped inside of the cat's body.
Felix goes to visit Tom. He is able to talk to him and knows what happened. He is told by Felix that he must reevaluate his priorities, connect with his family, and avoid past mistakes within one week or else be stuck as a cat forever. Lara and Rebecca take him home. Mr. Fuzzypants acts in an odd and stubborn way to try to convince his wife and daughter that he’s actually Tom. This only drives them mad and he slowly comes to see how much he has ignored his family. He also learns that Ian is trying to make the company public with the help of the board of directors to take power from Tom, even though David is trying to stop him. Ian has David fired from the company and plans to announce that the company will be sold at the party for the new tower opening.
Eventually Rebecca realizes that Mr. Fuzzypants is really her father. Meanwhile, Tom's body is in crisis at the hospital and Lara, David, and Rebecca all go there. Rebecca has the cat hidden in her backpack. In a moment alone, David tells Tom that he is sorry he failed to save the company and he takes Tom's ID badge. It is implied that David plans to commit suicide at the tower. At the hospital, Lara and Dr. Cole plan to disconnect Tom's respirator and let him die. Rebecca calls to the cat to come prove he's really Tom, but Tom remembers what Mr. Perkins said about love being sacrifice and decides to go after David instead, knowing that his human body will die and he will be trapped as a cat forever.
At the tower, David jumps off the building and the cat jumps after him pulling a cable. It is then revealed that David is wearing a BASE jumping parachute. He lands in the middle of the party, presents the articles of incorporation of the company, and announces that he now controls his father's 51% of the stock. He says the company will remain a family company and fires Ian. Although the cat is not seen landing, Tom wakes up from his coma just in time to see David's announcement on the television. Meanwhile, Ian passes Mr. Perkins who tells him to hang up his cell phone. Ian ignores him, but is then hit by a car, and his consciousness transfers into a cat that Mr. Perkins takes back to his shop.
Tom and Rebecca return to Perkins where Tom asks if he has any dogs. Perkins says he does not, but presents Mr. Fuzzypants who has one life left."
Pete's Dragon,"In 1977, Pete Healy, a five-year-old boy, is on a road trip with his parents when their car flips off the road following a near-collision with a deer. Pete’s mom and dad are killed, but Pete survives the accident and is chased into the forest by a pack of wolves. He is rescued by a huge dragon with green fur, yellow eyes, and wings. The dragon quickly bonds with Pete and becomes protective of the boy. Pete names the dragon ""Elliot"" after the character of a lost puppy from his favorite book.
Six years later, Pete, now 11, spots a lumberjack crew chopping down trees near his home. Natalie, the daughter of the ethical site foreman Jack, spots and chases him. When Natalie accidentally falls from a tree, her screams attract her father Jack and his girlfriend, park ranger Grace Meacham. Pete tries to run away, but Gavin, Jack's pragmatic brother, accidentally knocks him unconscious. After realizing that Pete has vanished, Elliot stumbles around looking for him and ends up knocking over a tree near the lumber camp, leading Gavin to organize a hunting party to find him. Meanwhile, Pete wakes up in a local hospital, which he escapes in an effort to return to the forest. Before the police can catch the boy, Grace finds Pete and asks him to come to her home and promises to take him to the forest the next day.
Gavin and his men locate Pete and Elliot's treehouse, but when they try to search it, Elliot reveals himself and scares them away. He follows them to town trying to find Pete. After seeing Pete settling in with Grace's family, he leaves. After Pete gives Grace a drawing of Elliot, she shows her father, Mr. Meacham. He says that he discovered the same dragon as a young man. He advises her to trust Pete, and to find Elliot.
The next day, Pete, Grace, Natalie, and Mr. Meacham travel to the forest to meet Elliot. A group of hunters led by Gavin surprise Elliot and shoot him with tranquilizer darts, then lock him up in Jack's warehouse. Before the authorities can inspect the dragon, Pete and Natalie free him from his chains and escape on a lumber truck with Mr. Meacham.
Angered, Gavin sets up a roadblock at the bridge to stop them. When Elliot tries to fly, he crashes into the truck, damaging its brakes and it goes through the barricade. Confused and frightened, Elliot perches on top of the bridge and starts breathing fire at the police. The bridge begins to collapse under the intense heat, causing Grace and Jack's truck to fall through. Gavin tries to save the pair from falling to their deaths. Elliot emerges from the ravine with Grace and Jack riding safely on his back. With a firefighting helicopter approaching, Pete decides to flee with Elliot back to the woods.
Pete pleads with Elliot to let him stay so he can protect him from his attackers, just as Elliot protected him. However, Elliot concludes that as long as they stay close together, Pete will always be in danger. He points out Pete's book to encourage him to return to stay with Grace and Jack. Pete is reluctant & worried for Elliott's safety, but ultimately trusts the dragon's judgment. After a very tearful hug, Elliot returns to the mountains and Pete returns to live with Grace and Jack as his new family.
In the years that follow, Grace and Jack marry and adopt Pete as their son. Not only has Elliot slowly faded from the town's memory, but Gavin has learned to be more scrupulous and has moved on from the experience. Pete and his family eventually go on vacation, and see that Elliot is finally reunited with his fellow dragons."
Sausage Party,"A supermarket called Shopwell's is filled with anthropomorphic grocery items that worship the human shoppers as gods who take groceries to a utopia known as the ""Great Beyond"" after they are purchased. Among the groceries in the store is a sausage named Frank, who dreams of living in the Great Beyond with his hot dog bun girlfriend, Brenda, and of finally consummating their relationship.
After Frank and Brenda's packages are chosen by a woman named Camille Toh to leave Shopwell's, a returned jar of Bickle's Honey Mustard tries to warn the groceries that the Great Beyond is a lie; nobody listens except for Frank. Honey Mustard calls on Frank to seek out a bottle of liquor named Firewater, and then falls to his death. This creates an accidental cart collision that causes Frank, Brenda, and several groceries to fall out, including an aggressive douche who gets his nozzle bent, and plots revenge against Frank and Brenda.
Seeking to verify Honey Mustard's warning, Frank leads Brenda, a lavash named Kareem Abdul Lavash, and a bagel named Sammy Bagel Jr. to the store's liquor aisle under the guise of taking a shortcut to their proper aisles. There, he smokes cannabis out of a kazoo and learns from Firewater that he and other non-perishable foods invented the story of the Great Beyond as a noble lie to assuage past foods' fears of being eaten by shoppers. Frank, vowing to reveal the truth to the groceries, is encouraged to travel beyond the store's freezer section to find proof. While waiting for Frank, Brenda and the others are led into the Mexican aisle by a bottle of Sigueme Tequila, where they meet Teresa del Taco, a taco who falls in love with Brenda on sight.
Meanwhile, Frank's friends Carl and deformed sausage Barry are horrified as they witness the other purchased foods being cooked and eaten by Camille, shown from the foods' perspective as a brutal murder. They try to escape out a window, but Carl is sliced in half and killed by Camille and only Barry succeeds. He then stumbles across a human druggie, who becomes able to communicate with his groceries after he injects himself with bath salts. After unsuccessfully attempting to cook Barry, the druggie is decapitated in a domestic accident.
After Frank separates from his friends, who disapprove of his skepticism of the Great Beyond, he discovers a cookbook behind the freezer section and reveals its contents to the rest of Shopwell's groceries. Initially panicking, the groceries choose not to believe Frank out of fear of losing their sense of purpose, prompting Frank to lash out at them for their blind belief. Barry and other groceries from the druggie's home return to the store with the druggie's severed head, revealing that the humans can be killed. The groceries are able to drug the human shoppers and employees using toothpicks laced with bath salts. When the drugged humans begin attacking the groceries, Frank convinces everyone to listen to him and join the fight against the humans.
A store-wide battle ensues with several humans getting gruesomely killed. Douche, who has absorbed the contents of liquor bottles, becomes a wild monster and takes control of Darren, the store manager, by inserting himself into his anus and yanking on his scrotum to puppeteer his actions. Once they catch Frank, Douche strangles him and bites on his torso. Barry and the other foods launch a rocket at Douche and Darren made from propane tanks and a garbage bin used to dispose of expired foods, killing them both right after Brenda rescues Frank. With the battle over, Frank, Brenda, Barry, Kareem, Sammy, Teresa and the other foods celebrate their victory with an orgy.
Afterwards, the gang meets Firewater and Gum, a Stephen Hawking-esque wad of chewing gum, who have had a psychedelic experience and discovered that their world is not real, and that they are merely cartoons voiced by famous actors in another dimension. Gum has constructed a portal to this dimension, and the groceries decide to travel there to meet their creators."
Florence Foster Jenkins,"Florence Foster Jenkins (Meryl Streep) is a New York City heiress and socialite who founded the Verdi Club to celebrate her passionate love of music. As it is 1944 and the U.S. is in the midst of World War II, Florence is of the opinion that ""music matters more than ever."" St. Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant), a British Shakespearean actor, is her husband and manager. Despite being married, Florence and Bayfield live in separate residences. She lives in a grand hotel suite while he resides in an apartment in the city with his secret mistress, Kathleen Weatherley (Rebecca Ferguson). Florence suffers from a long-term case of syphilis, which she contracted from her first husband. The illness has caused her to have various health problems for which she takes medication, including mercury and arsenic, that have toxic side effects. Due to the fear of passing the disease on to Bayfield, she remains abstinent from all sexual intercourse in her marriage, and Bayfield has sex with Kathleen.
Florence decides to resume her long-neglected singing lessons. She hires pianist Cosmé McMoon (Simon Helberg) and introduces him to her vocal coach, Carlo Edwards (David Haig), the assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera. McMoon is shocked that Florence is a terrible singer, yet Bayfield and Edwards pretend she is wonderful, with the former giving McMoon a dire warning against criticizing her.
Bayfield arranges a small recital, hand-picking the attendees. On the night of the performance, loyal Verdi Club members watch respectfully, but others can barely contain their laughter. Feeling encouraged by her recital’s good reviews, she makes a recording as a Christmas gift for the Verdi Club. Florence gives McMoon a copy, which leads to her recalling that Bayfield was an unsuccessful actor and that she hid negative reviews from him. She also informs McMoon of her history as a piano player and teacher, having once played for the President as a child. McMoon realizes that Florence is not as musically inept as he had thought, strengthening their friendship.
Florence and McMoon write and perform original songs together, one of which gets airtime on the radio, much to the shock and horror of Bayfield and Kathleen, despite many listeners enjoying it, believing it to be comedic. With this burst in popularity, Florence informs Bayfield that she has booked Carnegie Hall for a one night performance and will give away a thousand tickets to soldiers. Bayfield fails to dissuade her. Bayfield stressed over the impending performance, gets into a fight with a group of men laughing at Florence and McMoon's song at a bar. Kathleen, resenting the lack of attention, leaves Bayfield. McMoon confides to Bayfield that he fears that the recital will humiliate him and ruin his career. Bayfield replies that he gave up his acting career to support his wife and urges McMoon to possibly do the same for the sake of his friend. McMoon agrees, elated to at least play at Carnegie Hall.
The concert is packed and attended by the likes of Cole Porter and Tallulah Bankhead. When Florence begins singing, the soldiers laugh and jeer. Her supporters and loyal friends, however, scold them and then cheer for her to keep singing. She happily continues her performance. Meanwhile, the columnist Earl Wilson for the New York Post refuses to continue listening, telling a desperate Bayfield that he will write a damning review of the recital.
Bayfield, with McMoon's help, goes to great lengths so that she only receives good reviews by buying every copy of the New York Post in the vicinity and throwing them away. After being given sarcastically patronizing comments about her performance alluding to the New York Post's review by a pair of young men, Florence is driven to find a copy of the review in a trash can and is upset to the point of collapse. As she is dying in bed, Bayfield by her side, Florence remembers a fancy angel costume worn for the concert as an angel and imagines herself singing beautiful opera.[6] She imagines that she, McMoon and Bayfield all take a triumphant bow to a standing ovation. She points out proudly that even though people can say she could not sing, no one can say she did not sing. Peacefully, she dies."
Ben-Hur,"A Jewish nobleman, Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and his adoptive Roman brother Messala (Toby Kebbell) are best friends despite their different origins. While racing horses, Ben-Hur is hurt and Messala carries him back to their family home in Jerusalem. Despite the hospitality of Ben Hur's mother Naomi (Ayelet Zurer) and the affections of sister Tirzah (Sofia Black D'Elia), Messala feels alienated in his adopted family. He enlists in the Roman army and fights in the Roman Empire's wars in Germany. Ben-Hur also develops feelings for the family slave Esther (Nazanin Boniadi) although their different station in life compels him not to pursue her. But when her father Simonides (Haluk Bilginer) seeks to marry her off to a Roman, Judah declares his love for her and takes her as his wife.
Three years later, Messala returns as a decorated Roman officer. His return coincides with a rising insurrection by the Zealots, who are opposed to the oppressive nature of Roman rule. Judah treats and shelters a young Zealot youth named Dismas (Moisés Arias). Messala reunites with Ben-Hur and attempts to convince his adoptive brother to serve as an informant. Following a reunion dinner with Ben-Hur and his family, Messala informs them that a new Roman governor Pontius Pilate (Pilou Asbæk) will be taking residence in Jerusalem and that no incidents must occur.
Days later, Pontius Pilate marches into Jerusalem with Ben-Hur and his family watching from a balcony. Dismas attempts to assassinate Pilate with a bow but fails. In retaliation, the Romans storm Ben-Hur's household and arrest him and his family. Rather than betray a fellow Jew, Ben-Hur takes responsibility for the assassination attempt and is sentenced to enslavement aboard a galley. His mother and sister are sentenced to be crucified. Ben-Hur and Messala fall out with the two hating each other for their perceived betrayals. While being led to the galley, Ben-Hur encounters Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro), who fetches him some water.
Ben-Hur endures five years of slavery as a rower aboard a Roman galley under the command of Quintus Arius (James Cosmo). During a naval battle against Greek rebels in the Ionian Sea, Ben-Hur's galley is boarded. The drummer pressures the slaves to row, but the galley collides with another ship and is destroyed as Ben-Hur manages to cling to a floating mast. He is washed ashore and is found by Sheik Ilderim (Morgan Freeman), who recognizes him as an escaped slave. Ben-Hur manages to convince Ilderim not to hand him over to the Romans by treating one of the Nubian's racing horses. After Ben-Hur develops a bond with the four racing horses, a grateful Ilderim then trains Ben-Hur to be a chariot racer.
Ben-Hur and Sheik Ilderim later travel to Jerusalem to take part in a grand chariot race at the newly built Roman circus. Jesus' preaching ministry draws the attention of governor Pilate and Messala, who is now the commander of the Roman garrison and a champion chariot racer. While visiting Jerusalem, Ben-Hur encounters Esther, who has become a follower of Jesus and is involved in charity work. Esther tells Ben-Hur that his mother and sister are dead, and despite their reunion, the two are kept emotionally apart due to her new cause which is contrary to Judah's insistence on seeking revenge against Messala.
Ben-Hur later confronts Messala alone in their former home but is forced to flee when Roman soldiers turn up. After the Romans execute twenty Jews in reprisal, Esther completely falls out with Ben-Hur. Sheik Ilderim instructs Ben-Hur in chariot racing techniques. Later, Ben-Hur encounters a former Roman soldier named Druses (Marwan Kenzari), who informs him that his mother Naomi and sister Tirzah are still alive. However, their reunion is soured when Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister have leprosy, the former also appearing to have lost her memory.
Sheik Ilderim bribes Pilate into allowing Ben-Hur to compete by proposing a high wager. Esther tries to convince Messala not to race Ben-Hur, but he is adamant that he will win. On the day of the race, Ben-Hur follows Ilderim's instructions to hold back from the race until the final laps. Using dirty tactics, Messala manages to knock out the other competing charioteers. Following a brutal and grueling race, Ben-Hur wins the race. Messala survives but is badly wounded and loses a leg. Ben-Hur's victory embolden the Jewish spectators and yields dividends for Ilderim.
Despite his victory, Ben-Hur is despondent about his family and his former friend Messala. Later, Esther witnesses the arrest of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Ben-Hur and Esther witness a bruised and beaten Jesus being forced to carry his cross through the streets. Mirroring his first encounter with Jesus, Ben-Hur tries to offer Jesus water but is beaten by a Roman soldier. Following Jesus' crucifixion, a rainstorm occurs. Naomi and Tirzah are miraculously healed by rainwater containing the blood of Jesus, and Sheik Ilderim pays a ransom to set them free.
In the end, Ben-Hur reconciles with Messala. Despite his anger, Messala finds the strength to forgive Ben-Hur and is reconciled to him and his family. Together, Ben-Hur, his mother, sister, Esther, and Messala accompany Sheik Ilderim's caravan as they leave Jerusalem."
Kubo and the Two Strings,"In feudal Japan, 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating origami with music from his shamisen for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a samurai warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and Sariatu cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.
One day, Kubo learns of the village's Bon festival allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.
Kubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden snow monkey charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of ""Little Hanzo"", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an amnesiac samurai who was cursed to take the form of a stag beetle/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.
Kubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the ""Sword Unbreakable"" from an underground cave guarded by a giant skeleton. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the ""Breastplate Impenetrable"" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the ""Garden of Eyes"", who can entrance its victims with its many eyes by showing secrets. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and defeating Karasu.
They go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the ""Helmet Invulnerable"" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Beetle. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.
At the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant Dunkleosteus-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world."
War Dogs,"In 2005, David Packouz lives in Miami, Florida, working as a massage therapist and living with his girlfriend Iz. Desiring an additional source of income, David spends his life savings on high-quality Egyptian cotton sheets, planning to sell them to Miami retirement homes, but this venture fails to produce results. At a funeral for a friend, David runs into his high school best friend Efraim Diveroli, who had moved to Los Angeles some years prior to work with his uncle selling guns. Efraim has left his uncle and formed his own company, AEY, which fills orders for arms placed by the US government due to the ongoing War in Iraq. David's life takes another turn when his girlfriend informs him that she is pregnant. Efraim offers him a job at AEY, and even though David and Iz both vehemently oppose the war, David eventually agrees, telling his girlfriend that he has begun selling his cotton sheets to the US government through Efraim's contacts.
Efraim explains to David that all orders placed for military equipment are posted on a public website, where anyone can place bids on filling the orders, and their job is to find the small orders that larger contractors do not bother with and place bids on them, with these smaller orders still being worth millions of dollars. A local small business owner, Ralph Slutzky, assists the business with funding, under the false belief that AEY only sells arms to help protect Israel. Eventually, David and Efraim land a contract to provide several thousand Beretta pistols to the Iraqi Police in Baghdad, a deal that would put them on the map. Unfortunately, an Italian embargo blocks the shipment to Iraq, so Efraim attempts to route the shipment through Jordan, but the shipment gets held up there as well. With Iz discovering David's true business by overhearing a conversation between him and Efraim, leaving her upset, David and Efraim have to fly to Jordan to free up their cargo or risk being blacklisted by the US Government for failing to deliver.
In Jordan, Efraim manages to use bribes to free up the Beretta shipment, but are still not allowed to fly the cargo to Baghdad without a permit that will take several weeks to acquire. The guns are loaded up into a truck and the two are provided with a driver who offers to drive the guns to Iraq, as no permit is required for driving guns across the border. The three drive through the night, at one point bribing border patrol with two cartons of cigarettes, and at another point being attacked by insurgents while trying to get gas, but eventually arrive at the military base. Captain Santos, the man receiving the shipment, is impressed by the lengths the two went through to get the guns to him, and the two are paid.
After this, AEY continues to secure larger deals and make more money, even moving into a larger office and hiring more employees, and David's daughter Ella is born. Efraim, however, continues to grow more unstable and untrustworthy, as the company is suddenly given a chance to land their biggest deal yet. Known as ""The Afghan Deal"", the US Government wishes to arm the Afghan military for the long-term, and post a massive order worth $300 million, which includes 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition and would have netted the war dogs a $100 million profit. Filling this order proves to be near-impossible for such a relatively small company, particularly in that there is a global shortage on AK-47 ammunition, but the two end up lucking into an encounter with legendary US arms dealer Henry Girard. Girard has access to the massive weapon storages that were created in Albania but never used, and must now be disposed of in accordance with NATO treaties, which includes well over a hundred million rounds of AK-47 ammunition. Girard can not directly deal with the US Government anymore, due to being on a watchlist, and wants to make the deal through AEY. Efraim agrees, although David expresses discomfort working with a man who is on a terrorist watchlist.
The two go to Albania to confirm that the ammunition works, then place the winning bid on the contract – though Efraim is upset to learn that their bid was the lowest by $53 million, reducing their profit margin. Meanwhile, Iz grows frustrated with David's continuing string of lies about his work, and leaves to live with her mother. While in Albania to prepare the shipment, David discovers that virtually all of the rounds are Chinese-made and illegal under a US embargo against Chinese arms. Efraim comes up with the idea of re-packaging the rounds in generic packaging, pretending that they are concerned about the weight of the shipments (though it inadvertently does save $3 million in shipping costs). While the rounds are repackaged and shipped, Efraim learns that Henry charged them a 400% markup (10 cents on 2.5 cents) on the rounds, and wants to cut him out of the deal. David protests that they are all making great money, but Efraim destroys the only copy of his partnership contract with David and proceeds with his plan to cut Henry out.
Henry retaliates by having David kidnapped from his hotel room, beaten, and held at gunpoint before leaving him alive, though David is left wondering if his now missing Albanian driver, Bashkim, has been killed. David learns that Efraim has not paid the small ($100,000) cost to Enver, the Albanian who is handling the repackaging.
David returns to Miami, where he tells Efraim that he is quitting AEY and demands immediate payout of the $4 million (offers to settle for $1.6) owed for his work-to-date, but Efraim refuses and laughs about the partnership contract being gone. David returns to working as a massage therapist and convinces Iz to move back in with him by telling her the truth about his AEY work. Weeks later, Efraim and Ralph Slutzky meet with David. Efraim offers a severance package of just $200,000, which David responds to by threatening to blackmail him with the evidence he has of the falsified documentation the two created to look like a respectable company so they could secure the Afghan deal. Shortly after this, David and Efraim are both arrested by the FBI. Enver, not paid for the repackaging contract and understanding the Chinese embargo, had reported AEY to the Pentagon. The FBI had arrested Ralph, who then wore a wire during the meeting with David and Efraim, giving the FBI enough to arrest them. Efraim is sentenced to four years in prison for numerous crimes related to conspiracy and fraud on the Afghan deal, and David gets seven months house arrest in exchange for co-operating with the investigation.
Months later, David meets with Henry, who apologizes for the kidnapping and assault in Albania, claiming he had bad information. He also thanks David for not mentioning his name in his confession to the FBI. David begins to ask questions about the events of the deal, including the fate of Bashkim. In response, Henry pulls out a briefcase full of money, a part of his own cut from the Afghan deal, and offers it to David in exchange for dropping the subject. The movie ends before David decides."
Mechanic: Resurrection,"After faking his death, Arthur Bishop has been living quietly in Rio de Janeiro with the name Santos. He is approached by Renee Tran, who knows his true identity and explains that her employer wishes for Bishop to kill three targets and stage them as accidents. Seeing her mercenaries waiting nearby, Bishop makes his escape, and flees the country to Thailand. He takes shelter at the resort island beach house of his friend, Mei, and learns that Tran is working for Riah Crain. Bishop and Crain were orphans who grew up together but were sold to a gangster and trained as warriors. Bishop made his escape and left Crain behind.
Sometime later, a bruised woman, Gina Thornton, approaches Mei for first aid before returning to a boat anchored nearby. Mei observes Thornton being beaten by a man aboard the boat and alerts Bishop. Bishop and Mei rescue Thornton from the man, but in the scuffle, the man hits his head on the boat's equipment and dies. Finding no evidence of his identity, Bishop sets the boat ablaze. While Mei tends to Thornton's injuries, Bishop finds that Thornton is also connected to Crain, and believes Crain anticipated Bishop would become romantic with her; Crain would then have kidnapped her to make Bishop take the assassination jobs. When he charges Thornton with his theory, she reveals that Crain threatened the children's shelter in Cambodia where she works unless she participated. Over the next few days, Bishop gets to know Thornton better and falls in love, but as expected, Crain's mercenaries arrive and abduct them.
Crain threatens Thornton's safety to coerce Bishop to undertake the assassination jobs. The first target is a warlord named Krill, who is incarcerated in a Malaysian prison. Bishop travels to Malaysia and gets himself imprisoned to access Krill. Bishop gains Krill’s trust by killing a man already planning on killing Krill. Bishop kills Krill and escapes the prison with the help of Crain's operatives. The next target is Adrian Cook, who runs an underage trafficking ring from Sydney. Bishop bypasses the tight security of Cook's penthouse apartment and breaks the glass bottom of Cook's overhanging pool, plummeting him to his death.
While relaying details of the third target, Crain allows Bishop to speak to Thornton, who sends Bishop signals to help him identify Crain's boat. Bishop locates the boat and attempts to rescue her, but Crain recognizes Thornton's attempt in time and foils him. Crain demands Bishop complete the final assassination in 24 hours, identifying the target as Max Adams, an American arms dealer in Varna, Bulgaria. While planning the attempt, Bishop recognizes that Crain's targets were his only other major competition in arms dealing. Bishop instead approaches Adams and warns him of Crain's plan, and gets Adams to help. Bishop fakes Adams' death, and reports his success to Crain, who directs him to a meeting point.
There, Bishop fends off attacks by Crain's mercenaries and makes for Crain's boat anchored nearby. He fights off more of Crain's men and rescues Thornton. He discovers the boat is rigged with explosives and places Thornton in an escape pod. Crain attacks Bishop, but Bishop overpowers him and secures him to the boat. The bombs explode, killing Crain and apparently Bishop.
Thornton is rescued and the remains of Crain's boat are salvaged. Thornton returns to Cambodia and her teaching duties, where she is surprised when Bishop meets her there. Adams discovers how Bishop survived but destroys the evidence to protect Bishop's secret."
Don't Breathe,"Rocky, Alex, and Money are three Detroit delinquents who make a living by breaking into homes secured by Alex's father's security company and selling the items they take. However, the person buying the stolen goods for Money doesn't give them a fair price, not enough to fund Rocky's dream of moving to California with her little sister, Diddy, to escape their abusive mother and her alcoholic boyfriend. Money receives a tip that a medically retired US Army Special Forces veteran living in an abandoned Detroit neighborhood has $300,000 in cash in his house, given as a settlement after a wealthy young woman, Cindy Roberts, killed his daughter in a car accident. The three stake out the house and discover that the man is in fact blind, as he was blinded from a blast during the Gulf War.
That night, the three approach the house and drug the Blind Man's dog. Finding all entrances locked, Rocky enters the house through a small window and lets the other two in. The group searches the house for the money but are unable to find it. Money puts a sleeping gas in the Blind Man's bedroom, then, assuming the money is behind a locked door downstairs, shoots the lock. The noise wakes up the Blind Man, who demands to know who else is with Money. Money insists he is alone, and the Blind Man kills him with his own gun. Terrified, Rocky hides in a closet, where she witnesses the Blind Man open a safe to check on his money. After he leaves, she opens the safe and takes the money, which appears to be at least $1 million. The Blind Man however finds Rocky's shoes and realizes that Money was not the only intruder.
Rocky and Alex evade the Blind Man and hurry to the basement. There, they are shocked to find a restrained, gagged woman in a homemade padded cell. Desperate, she shows them a newspaper article about the car accident; they realize that she is Cindy, the rich young woman, held captive by the Blind Man. They free her and run for the storm cellar door, only to be taken off guard by the Blind Man, who mistakenly shoots and kills Cindy. He breaks down crying when he discovers she is dead, sobbing ""my baby."" Rocky and Alex flee into the cellar while the Blind Man shuts off the lights, plunging them into darkness. After a blind struggle, Alex knocks out the Blind Man, and they flee upstairs.
After blocking the basement door, they encounter the Blind Man's Dog, who has woken. They're unable to unlock the front door in time before the dog attacks them, and are forced to flee into the bedroom, where they're trapped by the barred windows. Rocky escapes the room through a ventilation duct, while the dog attacks Alex, who falls out of a window onto a skylight, going unconscious. When Alex awakens, the Blind Man shoots out the skylight and corners Alex in his utility room, appearing to kill him with a pair of pruning shears. Meanwhile, the dog pursues Rocky through the vents, and she is captured by the Blind Man. She wakes up restrained in the basement like Cindy was, and the Blind Man reveals that Cindy was carrying his child in order to replace the one she killed. He then prepares to artificially inseminate Rocky with a turkey baster, explaining that she will now be the one to give him a child. It is revealed that the Blind Man accidentally stabbed Money's corpse with the shears instead of Alex, who manages to save Rocky and handcuff the Blind Man.
Rocky and Alex are unable to call the police, as their blood is all over the house, so they try to leave through the front door. The Blind Man breaks free and shoots Alex dead. Rocky flees, but is pursued by the dog. She manages to trap the dog in her car trunk, but is recaptured by the Blind Man. Inside his house, Rocky disorients the Blind Man by setting off his house's loud alarm system, then hits him repeatedly in the head with a crowbar and pushes him into the basement. The gun fires into his side as he falls. Believing him dead, Rocky escapes before the police arrive.
With the money, Rocky prepares to leave Detroit with Diddy on a train to Los Angeles. Before boarding, she sees a news report stating that the Blind Man killed two intruders (Alex and Money) in his house and is in stable condition at the hospital, but did not report Rocky or the stolen money."
Hands of Stone,"The film follows the life of Panamanian boxing legend Roberto Durán, who made his professional boxing debut in 1968 as a 16-year-old and retired in 2001 at age 50.
Growing up in Panama, Durán is homeschooled by Chaflan, who teaches young Roberto some vital life lessons. Later, Duran joins a boxing club with Nestor ""Plomo"" Quiñones as his coach.
As he reaches 20, an American legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel, who nearly lost his life after being attacked by an unknown assailant in 1953 in New York City and is now living with his wife Stephanie, notices Roberto's raw talent and punching power and takes the young fighter under his wing, becoming his coach. Not long after, Durán then meets a student, Felicidad, with whom he later has five children.
After his fights through the 70s and 80s, rising through the divisions with phenomenal success (just one loss) he challenges Sugar Ray Leonard, dubbed as the ""Fighter of the Year."" However, Durán is disrespectful of Leonard, describing him as a ""clown"" and confidently predicts a knock out win for himself.
One night, Durán confronts Leonard in front of his wife and insults him by calling him a ""homosexual."" The incident frustrates Ray. Durán's hard feelings for Ray, on the other hand seem to stem from his resentment of Americans in general, because he recalls the ill-treatment meted out by the Americans to the nation of Panama, remembering how American troops took over the country by owning the Panama Canal — leading to conflict between the sides in 1964.
In June 1980, the day of fight between Durán and Leonard in which the venue is in Montreal, Durán wins via Unanimous decision as a Welterweight Champion (148-147, 145-144, 146-144). After the fight, Leonard states that being insulted is a strategy and calls for a rematch with an $8 million purse. At the house party, informed by his manager Carlos Eleta, Durán reluctantly agrees to the rematch. Chaflan is killed after being run over by a truck.
In November 1980, Durán and Leonard face at the ring for the second time, this time the venue is in New Orleans. But in the eighth round, the people of Panama are shocked when Durán gives up by saying ""No más"" (English: ""No more"") to the referee, thus Leonard wins via technical knockout (68–66, 68–66, and 67–66).
Upon returning home in Panama, he faces angry protests. Durán tells his wife that he regrets letting them down and needs to go back in the ring in order to regain his popularity and the forgiveness of his fans. Due to this incident, Arcel is retired from his training and tells Durán that Plomo will be his coach. In June 1983, New York City, the day of his fight against Davey Moore, Leonard gratefully meets Durán for the first time since the rematch, saying that he forgives Durán. He tells Leonard that he gives his apology to his wife. At the fight with Moore up to the eighth round, now Leonard is now commentator, Durán won via technical knockout, eventually restores his popularity and pride by the people of Panama.
In the film's epilogue, it states that Plomo was in Durán's side for each fight until his death in 2012; Leonard and Durán remain friends until now; Ray was the first boxing trainer to be elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame and died of leukemia in 1994 after the six-year battle."
The Light Between Oceans,"Tom Sherbourne, a traumatised and withdrawn hero of World War I, is hired as a lightkeeper at Janus Rock, a lighthouse off the coast of Western Australia. He falls in love with a local girl, Isabel Graysmark, and they marry in 1921. Isabel loses two pregnancies in three years, and fears she may never become a mother.
Shortly after Isabel's second miscarriage, a rowboat containing a dead man and a newborn baby girl washes up on the shore near the lighthouse. Tom knows that regulations require him to report the discovery. However, Isabel fears that the baby will almost certainly be sent to an orphanage, and persuades Tom to pass the baby off as their own. Tom grudgingly agrees. He buries the man on the island and they name the girl Lucy.
As Tom and Isabel are about to have Lucy christened on the mainland, Tom sees a woman, Hannah Roennfeldt, kneeling in front of a grave, bearing the names of Frank Roennfeldt and his baby daughter Grace Ellen, who were lost at sea on the day they found Lucy, 26 April 1923. Tom fears that Lucy might very well be Hannah's missing daughter. He writes anonymously to her to tell her that her husband is dead but that her baby is safe and well cared-for.
Four years later, Tom, Isabel, and Lucy, who have enjoyed an idyllic life together, attend a ceremony for the anniversary of Tom's lighthouse, and they strike up a conversation with Hannah and her sister, Gwen Potts. They learn that Frank was a German, that Hannah's marrying him so soon after the First World war was controversial, and that he had been accosted in the street by a drunken crowd. He jumped into a rowboat and fled along with his baby daughter. Tormented by his conscience, Tom sends Hannah a small rattle that was found with Lucy on the boat. One of Tom's co-workers recognizes the rattle on a reward poster, and reports him to the police.
Tom takes full responsibility, claiming he bullied Isabel into complying. Isabel is enraged that Tom is willing to give Lucy away, and breaks off contact with him after his arrest. Lucy is returned to her birth family, but initially rejects and hates them, having no memory of them. She refuses to answer to ""Grace"", and even runs away in an effort to go back to the lighthouse.
The police accuse Tom of murdering Frank, and are unable to draw an answer from the distraught Isabel as to whether he was dead when they discovered him. Just as Tom is about to be taken by boat to Albany for trial, Isabel reads a letter which Tom had sent her, writing of how he had not deserved his happiness with her and how carrying the blame will assuage his guilt for surviving the war. She jumps on the boat and confesses everything. Moved by their gesture, Hannah offers to speak on their behalf at trial. Lucy has at last begun to bond with her biological mother and grandfather, who agrees to call her ""Lucy-Grace"" as a compromise.
In 1950, an adult Lucy-Grace Rutherford, accompanied by her baby son Christopher, tracks Tom down. She has not been in contact with the Sherbournes for over twenty years, as they had agreed not to contact her for the rest of her childhood. Isabel has recently died, still tormented with guilt for her actions, and Tom gives Lucy-Grace a letter that she wrote for her in case she ever made contact. An emotional Lucy-Grace thanks Tom, the only father she knew, for rescuing and raising her for the few years on Janus, and they promise to stay in touch."
Morgan,"Lee Weathers is a ""risk-management specialist"" for genetic-engineering company SynSect. She arrives at a rural site hosting its L-9 project, an artificial being with nanotechnology-infused synthetic DNA named Morgan. The ""hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision making and sophisticated emotional responses"" is smarter than humans and matures quickly, walking and talking within a month and physically a teenager despite being five years old.
The cold and precise Weathers—she insists on calling Morgan ""it""—is at the site to assess the project after a psychologist evaluates Morgan, after she used a pen to stab Dr. Kathy Grieff in the eye. Over dinner with the team of eight scientists, Weathers (who speaks Chinese) and project leaders Dr. Lui Cheng and Dr. Simon Ziegler discuss an incident in Helsinki involving Cheng in which 21 SynSect researchers were killed in an hour by ""crude prototypes"".
Lee learns that Morgan attacked Grieff when she was prohibited from leaving her room, a glass cell, after killing a deer impaled on a fallen tree while outside. The scientists have raised Morgan from birth following two failed attempts, and most consider her to be their child; Grieff defends Morgan to Weathers despite her injury, and Dr. Amy Menser wants to resume taking her on outings. The latter promises Morgan to take her to a nearby lake that she describes as wonderful; the behavioral therapist understands that Morgan is, despite her intellect and physical appearance and abilities, emotionally childlike. Although Morgan considers Cheng to be her ""mother"", the scientist is pessimistic about the project; she ended the outings because, Cheng tells Weathers, it is cruel to expose Morgan to a world she cannot be allowed to enter.
Psychologist Dr. Alan Shapiro arrives; when the artificial intelligence expert aggressively taunts Morgan as part of his evaluation, she kills him. Weathers tranquilizes Morgan after a brief escape, and decides that she is too unpredictable and must be terminated. The scientists refuse to kill Morgan; before Weathers can do so, they inject her with sedative and imprison her in the cell in which Morgan had been held. The scientists plan to escape with Morgan, but after waking she kills most of them, while Ziegler commits suicide.
In the scientists' house, Cheng records an apology for the failure of the project. The scientists tried to make Morgan ""more human"" than the previous attempts so she could exceed her design as a combat weapon, but found that the result was harder to control. Morgan arrives and, after conversing with her ""mother"" in Chinese, suffocates her. Weathers escapes the cell and briefly fights Morgan, able to match her. Morgan flees with the terrified Menser, who Morgan says is the only scientist who was a real friend to her.
Weathers and nutritionist Skip Vronsky follow the pair. The latter deduces that Morgan has forced Menser to take her to the lake, which entrances Morgan. She and Weathers fight again, seemingly matched in strength and speed. Morgan knocks down Weathers, who is impaled on the branch of a fallen tree. Morgan flees again but Weathers catches up and kills her. She shoots Menser and Vronsky to eliminate witnesses.
Weathers's superior at SynSect and another executive discuss the incident. They decide that it proves that the company's earlier L-4 project—Lee Weathers—is superior as a ""perfect"", less-emotional, human hybrid weapon. Elsewhere, Weathers makes the same gesture with her hands as Morgan, when Shapiro had asked her how she had felt about injuring Grieff."
Sully,"On January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the Airbus A320 strikes a flock of birds, disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports (Teterboro Airport being the closest), Sully ditches the aircraft on the Hudson River. The crew and passengers evacuate without casualty. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him haunted, and experiencing a dream in which the plane crashes into a building.
Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS suggest that the port engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. The National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport without engines. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.
Sully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been pilot error, which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to divert the plane.
Both simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is diverted. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard."
When the Bough Breaks,"A married couple in their 40s, named John and Laura Taylor (Morris Chestnut and Regina Hall) desperately want to have a baby, but they are unable to have a lasting pregnancy. Laura had already suffered three miscarriages in the past years.

Laura and John devise a plan to get their unborn baby back by making John act as if he returns Anna's feelings. They meet at the aquarium. As Anna thinks she is being played, she walks away. John stops her and kisses her forcefully, they then go up to the family lake house.
John returns home to Laura the next day. The plans works fine until Anna notices the two embracing each other. Anna leaves John a voicemail claiming the baby's coming. John leaves to go to the hospital while Laura stays home.
Anna kills the family cat and then hits Laura in the head with a lamp, knocking her out but goes into labor. While in the hospital they discover that Anna has fled to the family lake-house with the baby. John manages to get the baby but Anna wakes up and a fight breaks out between the two of them. John throws her onto a cabinet which knocks her unconscious. John goes outside and Laura places the baby in the car. When Laura turns on the lights she sees Anna standing in front with a gun. Anna shoots at the car and misses but hits the window. Laura runs over Anna with her car, killing her.
The morning after, Laura, the baby and John are sitting inside the Lake house. They hear the police arrive and John turns to Laura and says ""It's going to be okay."""
The Wild Life,"On a tiny isolated South Pacific Island, a Scarlet Macaw named Mak and his friends, including an echidna named Epi, a chameleon named Carmello, a tapir named Rosie, a kingfisher named Kiki, an old goat named Scrubby, and a pangolin named Pango live the perfect life: blue skies, beautiful turquoise water, and lots of delicious fruit and crunchy insects. But every day is the same and Mak is really bored. Convinced there is more than just water over the horizon, he dreams of leaving his little paradise and exploring the world. Meanwhile, an English man named Robinson Crusoe and his dog, Aynsley have booked passage on a ship in order to explore the islands. During a very violent tropical storm at night, the two are accidentally locked in the ship's hull along with a pair of embittered cats, Mal and May, while the crew escapes with their lives; leaving the latter behind. During the storm, Mak and his friends try to save Scrubby from falling to his death, which nearly goes bad, while trying to seek shelter in a cave on the high grounds from the storm.
Washing ashore on the island, in the morning, Crusoe begins to take stock of the remaining supplies while the animals, unsure of what to make of the new arrivals, hide out on the beach. Mak, seeing his chance to get off the island, convinces the others to hide while he keeps an eye on them. Unfortunately, the next day, he is attacked by Mal and May, having also survived the storm. Luckily, Aynsley manages to drive them off and Crusoe takes Mak aboard the wreckage to recover from his wing injury from the attack. He renames the bird Tuesday (after their second day on the island) and Aynsley convinces him that he and Crusoe are friends.
Determined to take control of the island and make the human pay for the years of bad treatment they had to endure, Mal and May trick the other animals into believing Crusoe is going to eat Mak. They have them attack Crusoe while they go after Mak and Aynsley in order to cover their tracks. In the ensuing chaos, Aynsley is pinned under a door as the wreckage begins to catch fire. Mak makes it out in time, but Aynsley dies in the explosion, which strands Mal and May on ""Curse Island"", a rock off the coast inhabited by countless bugs that the islanders view as a death sentence.
After Crusoe mourns Aynsley's death, Tuesday leads a grieving Crusoe to the others, having realized the cats' deception, in an attempt to cheer him up. Slowly but surely, the islanders drop their guards and begin helping him adjust to life on the island by providing him with fruits for food and helping him build a tree house, a ""pipeline"" for the fresh water supply, and a watchtower in case of any passing ships. However, Kiki becomes increasingly annoyed by the others' willingness to adapt to Crusoe's lifestyle as the months go by. Yet, sometimes, Crusoe seems upset by the dwindling possibility of a rescue. One afternoon, Kiki, worked up, flies out near the remains of the wreckage; lamenting about their lives with Crusoe, until Mal and May, with multiple litters of youngsters and having survived with nothing to eat but bugs on the rock, manage to get back on the main island from the wooden plank remains of the ship and decide to put an end to Crusoe and his friends' lives and wreak havoc on their little piece of Eden.
Despite Mal and May's best efforts, the islanders manage to drive them back momentarily. Realizing the cats won't stop harassing them, at night, Tuesday leads them to the watchtower and, with his friends' help, traps them inside while the animals knock it down along with the cats into the sea. However, their victory is short lived when a fire set by May earlier endangers Crusoe, who was knocked unconscious in the previous fight. Tuesday manages to get him out, but Crusoe becomes caught in some rigging and is rendered unconscious again by a falling wooden plank.
Complicating matters is that the fire attracts the attention of a group of pirates led by Long John Silver, who drive off the ""wild beasts"" trying to save Crusoe on the same night and ""rescue"" him the next morning. Crusoe manages to placate them with a fictionalized version of what happened at the expense of the captain forcing him into the crew and refusing to return him back home to England due to the fear of being hung from the gallows; despite considering Crusoe's story as nothing more than yarn. During his story-telling, Tuesday, who followed Crusoe onto the boat, tells the true story of what really happened to a pair of mice named Rufus and Cecil.
A poorly planned escape attempt by Crusoe results in a hectic chase. Tuesday rescues him (by tricking the pirates with a perfect voice imitation of their captain momentarily) and the mice and make their way back to the island while the cats, who snuck onto the ship on a jerry-rigged life raft made out from the remains of the watchtower, which Crusoe later uses to row back to the island, are taken in by the pirates.
During the credits, stills of the animals' lives with Robinson Crusoe along with Rufus and Cecil are revealed as they repair the tree house while readjusting to their lives on the island and the cats adjusting to life with Long John Silver and his crew."
The Disappointments Room,"Looking for a fresh start after the accidental death of their infant daughter Catherine, architect Dana Barrow (Kate Beckinsale) moves with her husband David (Mel Raido) and 5-year-old son Lucas from Brooklyn to the Blacker estate in rural North Carolina, a once-grand dream home that has sat abandoned and run-down since the death of its original owners in the 19th century. Upon her arrival, Dana begins having unsettling visions and nightmares of a mysterious German Shepherd and of Lucas covered in blood. While exploring the grounds outside, Dana finds what appears to be a homemade gravestone engraved with the drawing of a kite, when she sees a light turn on in the house's attic, seemingly of its own accord. Heading upstairs, Dana finds an area of the house not listed in the blueprints, a room whose entrance is blocked off by a large armoire. With David, she manages to push the cabinet out of the way, only to find a locked door. Dana finds the key hidden atop the door frame, and enters the room alone the next day, only for the door to suddenly close and lock of its own accord. Dana experiences a vision of a young girl being tormented by her father and his German Shepherd, and subsequently suffers a nervous breakdown.
Dana eventually makes it out of the room, but is deeply shaken by her experience. She begins to research the history of the house, learning about its namesake Judge Ernest Blacker (Gerald McRaney) and his daughter Laura, who died on the same day as Catherine; July 5th. Dana consults the local historian Judith, who tells her the Blacker family had a secret ""disappointments room"" in the attic, where wealthy socialite families cruelly shuttered their deformed or disabled children. As she spends more time researching the house and its history, Dana's mental state begins to unravel, and she stops taking her medication. She begins having increasingly vivid and disturbing visions of Laura, Judge Blacker, and the dog, and begins acting erratically toward David and Lucas. She finds a portrait of Judge Blacker and Mrs. Blacker hidden behind a pair of facing mirrors, and burns it.
While David entertains family friends, Dana hires local handyman Ben Philips (Lucas Till), who has been performing maintenance on the house's leaking roof, to dig up the grave in the backyard. The ghost of Judge Blacker suddenly manifests and kills Ben with a shovel. Dana discovers Ben's body hanging from a noose above the open grave, inside of which sits Laura's deformed skeleton. Dana sees another light appear in the attic, and when she goes inside, finds the portrait she burned intact and in their place. Entering the disappointments' room, she witnesses a flashback of Judge Blacker murdering Laura with a hammer as his wife futilely tries to stop him. Blacker's dog attacks Dana as he moves toward Lucas' bedroom. Dana breaks the dog's neck and picks up the hammer, running to Lucas' room and stopping Blacker from killing her son by repeatedly bashing him in the head with it. David rushes in, seeing Dana frantically hitting an empty bed. He tries to get her to calm down, telling her that there's no one there.
Calming down, Dana reflects on Catherine's death, revealing that she accidentally smothered her, triggering her slow spiral into insanity. David vows that they will return to Brooklyn, and that Dana will get better. Before leaving, David removes the door from the disappointments' room, and Dana takes one of Laura's figurines. As they drive away, Dana spots Judge Blacker looking down at them from the window."
Bridget Jones's Baby,"On her 43rd birthday, Bridget Jones is awoken by her mother who reminds her that her time to have children is running out. She goes to attend the funeral of Daniel Cleaver, who is presumed dead after a plane crash. While there, she sees her ex, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and his new wife. They bump into one another somewhat awkwardly and then go their separate ways.
Bridget now works as a television producer and is close friends with the anchor of the show she runs, Miranda (Sarah Solemani), who offers to take her out for her birthday. Bridget turns down her offer to spend time with her old group of friends, but is heartbroken when they cancel on her due to commitments to their children.
Deciding to celebrate her single life Bridget accepts Miranda's offer to take her away for the weekend. They go to a music festival where Miranda challenges her to sleep with the first man she meets. Falling in the mud, Bridget is helped out by a random stranger. After attending an Ed Sheeran concert, a drunk Bridget crawls into a yurt she thinks belongs to her and Miranda but actually belongs to the handsome stranger she met earlier. The two have sex and in the morning Bridget makes her escape. The stranger returns disappointed that she is gone.
Returning home, Bridget goes to the christening of Jude's youngest child where she is the godmother and Mark has been asked to be the godfather. Mark tells her that he and his wife are planning on divorcing and Bridget has sex with him. When Mark reveals he is travelling the next day, Bridget is reminded that he had always put work before their relationship and leaves in the morning before he wakes up, leaving behind a note telling him that reconnecting with him is too painful.
Bridget finds that she is gaining weight. Shazzer suggests that Bridget might be pregnant, especially when she realises that Bridget used old, expired condoms when having sex. Taking a pregnancy test at work, Bridget confirms she is pregnant and decides that she wants to keep the baby as it is her last chance to have a child.
After a visit to the obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr. Rawlings, she realizes that she does not know who the father is and doesn't even have a way of contacting Jack, the handsome stranger. However, Miranda spies him on TV where they realize that Jack Qwant is a billionaire and the inventor of a dating site that has an algorithm to match couples together. Miranda conspires with Bridget to have Jack on the show to take hair samples so that Bridget will be able to test it against the DNA of her baby to either confirm or eliminate Jack as the father. At the taping the hair and makeup artist is able to nab samples of Jack's hair for Bridget but Jack recognizes Bridget, and she decides to tell him that she is pregnant and that he is the father, without mentioning Mark. Initially taken aback Jack decides to throw himself into the role of supporting Bridget.
Feeling things are going too quickly with Jack, Bridget decides to go forward and tell Mark. However Mark is so thrilled at the news that he is about to be a father that Bridget does not tell him about Jack. Bridget also decides not to go forward with testing the DNA while her child is still in the womb as she is terrified by the possibility that she might miscarry. She persuades Dr. Rawlings to go through appointments twice, once with Jack and another time with Mark.
Bridget invites Jack to a work event and is startled when Mark shows up as well. The two men immediately take a liking to one another, finding the other's accomplishments impressive. They go out to dinner where Bridget finally comes clean and tells them that she is unsure who the father is. Jack takes the news well, telling Bridget that the child is the priority. Mark Darcy is upset and walks out of the restaurant.
At an ante-natal class, Jack arrives early and Bridget is gratified when Mark shows up as well. Jack and Mark are mistaken for a gay couple with Bridget as their surrogate, much to Mark's discomfort and Jack's amusement. Mark is also jealous at the easy rapport that Jack has with Bridget and his warmth in taking care of her.
Bridget experiences cramps and goes to the hospital, taking Jack with her as she is unable to reach Mark. When at last Mark arrives he is upset to see the two laughing together and embracing. Mark and Jack fight and Bridget sends them out of the room. Outside, Jack implies that he and Bridget had sex without condoms, making Mark realize that he is less likely to be the father. He leaves once again and ignores Bridget's calls.
Bridget continues to prepare for the arrival of her baby, now with only Jack by her side. They have a discussion where he asks her to move in with him and confesses that life for him is lonely. Bridget asks him what will happen if Mark is the father and he tells her he will need to re-evaluate their relationship if that is the case. He also confesses that the reason Mark has been absent is because Jack heavily implied that Mark was unlikely to be the father. An upset Bridget goes to talk to Mark, but sees his wife arriving at his house and decides to let him be.
At nine months, Bridget quits her job rather than being fired for numerous gaffes and unprofessional mishaps, notably inviting a guest onto the show with the sole intent of obtaining a sample of his DNA, live broadcasting bare arses during the launch event of a public news-gathering initiative and mixing up a guest with his chauffeur. Unemployed, exhausted, and hungry, she goes out shopping but has her card eaten by a cashpoint and locks herself out of the bank lobby, leaving her keys and her food inside. When no one buzzes her up to her building, she stands outside her apartment in the rain feeling miserable. Mark arrives and breaks in for her. He informs her that he and his wife are going through with their divorce and she was only there to pick up the last of her things. Just as they are about to kiss, Bridget's water breaks. When his phone rings for work, he throws it out the window in a romantic gesture, which leaves them without a means to call transport to the hospital. They enlist the help of a local restaurant to get them to hospital, but a traffic jam due to protests forces them to walk. Overtaken by contractions, Bridget cannot walk and Mark offers to carry her, but almost collapses. Jack arrives just in time and the two of them get Bridget to the hospital.
During labour, both Mark and Jack try to help Bridget. However, during labour Bridget accidentally punches Jack in the nose. She also reaches to Mark for comfort and he reassures her that she can get through labour and he will love her no matter whether the child is his or not, while sustaining an agonizing bite to the wrist by Bridget. While Jack and Mark wait outside, Jack apologizes to Mark for his behaviour and Mark accepts. Bridget gives birth to a boy and all of Bridget's friends and relatives come to visit her in the delivery room. Meanwhile, Dr. Rawlings has both men come with her to perform the DNA test. After having bonded for the last 6 months Mark and Jack each wish each other luck.
A year later Bridget prepares to be married. At the altar she is greeted by Jack, holding her son, and then moves forward to marry Mark. After the wedding, Mark and Jack, now friends, head to the reception together while Bridget carries her and Mark's son, William.
A newspaper lying on a bench reveals that Daniel Cleaver has been found alive in the woods in the wreckage of the plane."
Snowden,"In 2013, Edward Snowden arranges a clandestine meeting in Hong Kong with documentarian Laura Poitras and journalist Glenn Greenwald. They discuss releasing the classified information in the former’s possession regarding illegal mass surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA).
In 2004, Snowden is undergoing basic training, having enlisted in the U.S. Army with intentions of matriculating to the Special Forces. He eventually fractures his tibia, and is informed that he will be receiving an administrative discharge and that he may serve his country in other ways.
Snowden applies for a position at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and subsequently undergoes the screening process. Initially his answers to the screening questions are insufficient, but Deputy Director Corbin O'Brian decides to take a chance on him, given the demands of such extraordinary times. Snowden is then brought to ""The Hill"" where he is educated and tested on cyberwarfare. He learns about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which circumvents the Fourth Amendment rights of U.S. citizens by allowing warrant requests to be approved by a panel of judges that were appointed by the Chief Justice. Snowden and his peers are each tasked with building a covert communications network in their hometown, deleting it, and then rebuilding it in eight hours or less, with five hours being the average time taken. Snowden impresses O'Brian when he completes the exercise in 38 minutes.
Meanwhile, Snowden meets Lindsay Mills via a dating website. The two bond, despite sharply contrasting political ideologies. Snowden acquires his first post abroad working with diplomatic cover in Geneva in 2007, taking Mills with him. He meets Gabriel Sol, who has ample experience in electronic surveillance. Snowden begins questioning the ethical implications of their assignment. After his superior decides to set up their target on a DUI charge in order to leverage information from him, Snowden resigns from the CIA.
Snowden later takes a position with the NSA in Japan, initially under the pretense of building a program that would allow the government to back up all critical data from the Middle East in an emergency, a program which he names ""Epic Shelter"". Snowden learns of the practices the NSA and other U.S. government agencies are using not just in Japan, but in most countries which the U.S. is currently allied with, which include planting malware in different computers that manage government, infrastructure and financial sectors so that, in the event that any allies turn against the US, that country can effectively be shut down in retaliation. The stress associated with the job results in the end of his relationship with Mills, who moves back with her family in Maryland.
Three months later, Snowden has left his post with the NSA and returned to Maryland where he and Mills resume their relationship and he takes a position consulting for the CIA. During a hunting trip, O'Brian reveals an operation in Oahu that revolves around counterattacking Chinese hackers. After Snowden is diagnosed with epilepsy, Mills agrees that he should join the operation for she believes the environment in Hawaii may be beneficial for his health. Upon beginning his new job in ""The Tunnel"", an underground World War II bunker that has been re-purposed for massive electronic surveillance and SIGINT operations, Snowden learns that Epic Shelter is actually providing real-time data that assists U.S. drone pilots in launching lethal strikes against terror suspects in Afghanistan.
Snowden ultimately becomes disillusioned with what he is a part of. It culminates in Snowden smuggling a microSD card into his office by way of a Rubik's Cube, and loading all relevant data. He then tells his colleagues he is feeling ill and departs. He advises Mills to fly home to Maryland, after which he contacts Poitras and Greenwald to schedule the meeting.
With the help of journalist Ewen MacAskill, the information is disseminated to the press on June 5, 2013, with additional leaks published in the following days. In the aftermath, with the help of MacAskill, Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden is smuggled out of Hong Kong on a flight bound for Latin America by way of Russia. However, the U.S. government revokes his passport, forcing him to remain in Moscow indefinitely. He is eventually granted asylum for three years, with Mills joining him at a later date. Snowden continues his activism."
Blair Witch,"In 2014, James Donahue finds a video on YouTube containing an image of a woman he believes to be his sister Heather, who disappeared in 1994 near Burkittsville, Maryland while investigating the legend of the Blair Witch. Believing she is still alive, he heads into the woods, accompanied by friends Peter Jones, Ashley Bennett, and film student Lisa Arlington, who wants to film James' search as a documentary, The Absence of Closure.[11][12] Locals Talia and Lane, who found and uploaded the video, join them.
While walking through the woods and upon setting up camp for the night, Lane and Talia discuss the disappearance of Heather and her film crew, the 1940-41 murders by Rustin Parr, and other mysterious occurrences, which they ascribe to the Blair Witch. They hear noises during the night, then awaken at 2 p.m. to find strange stick figures hanging from the trees. When Lisa notices twine in Lane's backpack, he and Talia admit to creating the figures in order to convince the group to believe, but also point out that there is no explanation for the strange noises during the night and sleeping through the day. James and his friend banish Lane and Talia from their group and head out of the woods.
After hours of walking, the four surprisingly arrive back at their original campsite. Lisa pilots a drone to obtain their location, but it malfunctions. Ashley becomes sick due to a wound on her foot, forcing the group to camp again. When Peter inspects Ashley's wounded foot, he notices what he thinks may be a parasite inside the wound. Peter leaves the camp for firewood, soon being chased by an unknown entity; a tree falls on him, then he disappears.
Lane and Talia appear in the night, claiming they have been wandering for five days without a sunrise. Lane believes the camp is a hallucination and runs off, leaving the dishevelled and ravenously hungry Talia. The next morning, James and Lisa are stunned to find that it is still dark outside at 7am and discover larger stick figures. Talia sees clumps of her hair tied to one of the figures. Ashley accuses Talia of crafting them and snaps the figure with Talia's hair in half; Talia is then snapped in half. An unseen force lifts their tent and the group is separated. Ashley finds the drone and climbs a tree to recover it, but is knocked out and falls from the tree, the unknown entity dragging her away.
A rainstorm ensues as Lisa and James stumble across Rustin Parr's house, which James had previously stated to have been burned down after his execution. James hears Heather scream upstairs, enters the house and sees Peter standing in the corner. He chases after the figure he believes to be Heather, confronted by a teleporting dishevelled figure;[b] upon its vanishing he barricades himself.
Lisa spots the unknown entity, a tall, pale, long-limbed creature moving through the trees, and she runs into the house's basement. She finds an aged and hostile Lane who traps her in an underground tunnel as “you have to do what she tells you”. The tunnel connects to a different part of the house, where Lisa stabs and kills Lane when he attacks her. Lisa flees when the long-limbed creature emerges from the tunnel and chases her through the house. Lisa runs up to the attic with Lane's camcorder, creating the paradox video that lured them all to the woods.[c]
She reunites with James in the attic and they try to barricade the door. A bright light shines from outside the building, moving until stopping at the door, indicating the arrival of the witch. James tells Lisa to face the corner of the room and desperately apologizes to her for their fate before the witch enters, alongside her creature. James is tricked into turning around, believing that he hears Heather's voice, and vanishes from sight. Lisa uses Lane's camcorder to view what is behind her and begins walking backward. However, hearing James' apology again, she turns, and vanishes, leaving her camera behind before it gives out, leaving their fates unknown."
Hillsong: Let Hope Rise,"The film chronicles the unlikely rise to prominence of the Australia-based Christian band Hillsong United.[4][5] Their music is so popular it is estimated that on any given Sunday, more than 50 million churchgoers around the world are singing their songs.[6] The film follows an event that took place on 23 October 2014 at the Forum arena in Los Angeles with 17,000 people attending, and moments preceding the concert with the creation of new songs featured on Empires (2015).[7]"
The Magnificent Seven,"In 1879, robber baron and gold-mining tycoon Bartholomew Bogue assumes control of the American frontier town of Rose Creek, and subjects its residents to forced labor in his mines. After a town church assembly denounces him, Bogue has the church torched and kills a group of rebellious locals led by Matthew Cullen. Matthew's widow, Emma Cullen, and her friend Teddy Q. ride in search of bounty hunters to help liberate the town. They recruit Sam Chisolm, an African-American U.S. Marshal, who expresses interest after hearing of Bogue's involvement.
With the help of Emma and Teddy, Chisolm recruits gambler and outlaw Joshua Faraday, Mexican fugitive Vasquez, former Confederate marksman Goodnight ""Goody"" Robicheaux, Robicheaux's Korean traveling partner Billy Rocks, and legendary game hunter Jack Horne. The group encounters a Comanche warrior named Red Harvest, whom Chisolm persuades to join the posse.
The Seven enter Rose Creek and eliminate 22 Blackstone private military contractors on Bogue's payroll. Chisolm sends the corrupt sheriff Mr. Harp away to inform Bogue that they now control his holdings in Rose Creek. Chisolm surmises that Bogue will return with an army in seven days; the Seven (plus Emma) liberate forced laborers from a Bogue Mining digsite, and spend the next week fortifying the town and training the locals in combat. Meanwhile, Bogue receives the news of Rose Creek's liberation, murders Harp for his failure, and orders his Comanche enforcer Denali and his right-hand-man McCann to assemble an army. Robicheaux, haunted by his experiences in the Civil War and fearing his own death if he kills again, leaves the town the night before Bogue's arrival; Emma volunteers to take his place.
The next morning, Bogue and his army attack Rose Creek, which has been surrounded with traps and explosive networks. As the battle goes on, Faraday is shot and wounded by McCann, who is killed by Vasquez, the defensive line collapses, and Robicheaux returns to help. Bogue and his remaining men fire a Gatling gun from a hill leading into the town, killing many Rose Creek residents and Bogue's own mercenaries. Realizing they are outgunned, the Seven evacuate the townspeople and mount their last stand. Horne protects a wounded Teddy Q. from gunfire, but is killed by Denali, who is later killed by Red Harvest.
Robicheaux and Billy are killed by a second round of gunfire; while Faraday makes a suicidal charge up the hill and destroys the Gatling gun with dynamite, killing most of Bogue's remaining men. Bogue and his two surviving mercenaries proceed into the town to confront Chisolm. After killing the two men, Chisolm enters a standoff with Bogue, and shoots his hand as he draws, disarming him. A wounded Bogue retreats into the church, where Chisolm reveals that his family was lynched in 1867 by ex-Confederate soldiers, who were hired by Bogue to drive homesteaders out of Kansas. After imploring Bogue to repent, Chisolm tries to garrote him; Bogue retrieves a revolver he stashed in his boot, but Emma shoots him dead from the church doorway.
The townspeople return to Rose Creek and thank Chisolm, Vasquez, and Red Harvest for their service as they ride off; while Faraday, Robicheaux, Billy, and Horne are buried near town and honored as heroes. Emma, in voice-over narration, reflects fondly on their noble sacrifice that made them ""magnificent""."
Storks,"For generations, the storks of Stork Mountain delivered babies to families around the world, until one stork named Jasper attempted to keep an infant girl for himself. Jasper accidentally destroyed the infant’s address beacon and went into exile. Unable to deliver the orphaned girl, the storks adopted her under the name Tulip. CEO stork Hunter discontinued baby delivery in favor of package delivery with Cornerstore.com.
Eighteen years later, Tulip, now a young adult, tries to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, which backfire and cause the company to lose stocks. Hunter declares her to be a severe burden and liability due to this incompetence (the charts even justify this, as every time she tries to help, their profits go way down, and when they do make progress, it is when she's absent). Hunter assigns top delivery stork Junior to fire Tulip so he may be promoted to boss. Junior cannot bring himself to do so and instead transfers Tulip to the mail room.
Meanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner, who lives with his workaholic parents Henry and Sarah, is feeling lonely and wants a younger sibling. He sends a letter to Cornerstore and it reaches Tulip, who enters the defunct baby factory and inserts the letter into the baby-making machine, causing it to create a pink-haired infant girl. Junior injures his wing trying to shut down the machine. Afraid Hunter will fire him, Junior agrees to accompany Tulip and secretly deliver the baby to her family using a makeshift flying craft that Tulip invented. They eventually crash, escape a pack of wolves that fall in love with the baby, and reach civilization, during which Junior and Tulip bond with the baby and name her Diamond Destiny. In the meantime, Henry and Sarah open up to Nate’s desire for a younger sibling and spend time with their son by building a landing platform for the storks.
Junior and Tulip encounter Jasper, who had followed them from Stork Mountain. Jasper has nearly repaired Tulip’s delivery beacon, but is missing one piece, which had been in Tulip’s possession for years. Junior confesses to Tulip that he was supposed to fire her, and a saddened Tulip leaves with Jasper to meet her family while Junior continues alone to deliver Diamond Destiny. Cornerstore’s pigeon employee Toady learns about Diamond Destiny and informs Hunter, who reroutes her address beacon and leads Junior into a trap. Hunter fires Junior and has Diamond Destiny taken away to live with penguins until she is an adult in order to silence the incident and prevent more plummeting stocks.
Tulip reunites with Junior and they return to Stork Mountain during the highly anticipated Storkcon event to save Diamond Destiny from the penguins. When they are cornered in the baby factory by Hunter and the other stork employees, Junior sends millions of archived letters from families into the baby-making machine, causing it to rapidly produce babies and distract the storks. Hunter seizes control of a giant crane and tries to destroy the factory, only to have Diamond Destiny and abused birds help make the Cornerstore building collapse off Stork Mountain, causing Hunter, who is entangled in the building cables and trapped inside the crane, to fall to his death.
In the aftermath, Junior rallies the storks to deliver all the babies to their families. Junior, Tulip, and Jasper deliver Diamond Destiny to the Gardners, Tulip finally meets her family, and Junior and Tulip continue working as co-bosses at Stork Mountain."
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,"For years, Abraham Portman has told stories to his grandson Jake about his childhood surviving in World War II, battling monsters and living at a secret home for children in Cairnholm, Wales. According to Abe, the home's children and their headmistress Miss Alma Peregrine possess paranormal abilities and are known as ""Peculiars"". When Jacob turns sixteen, Jake responds to a panicked phone call from Abe, and goes to his house to find him dying with his eyes removed. Abe tells him to go to ""the loop of September 3, 1943"". After Abe dies, Jake glimpses a monster exactly like the ones described in Abe's stories hiding in the forest.
Jake's parents sign him up for psychiatrist check-ups, and following advice from his psychiatrist, Dr. Golan, and the lead of a letter from Miss Peregrine to Abe, Jake travels to Cairnholm with his father to investigate the children's home, whereupon he learns that it was destroyed during a Luftwaffe raid. However upon visiting the ruined house, he finds the children there alive and well. They take him through a portal in a cave and he emerges in the year 1943 when the house was still intact. Miss Peregrine greets him and explains that she belongs to a class of female Peculiars called ""Ymbrynes"" who can shapeshift into birds (in Miss Peregrine's case, a peregrine falcon) and manipulate time. To avoid persecution, she and the children hide from the outside world in a time loop she created, accessible only to Peculiars and set to September 3, 1943. This time loop allows them to live the same day repeatedly and avoid aging as long as they stay inside of it.
Jake is introduced to the rest of the children, including aerokinetic Emma Bloom, to whom he is attracted. Jake learns that he himself is a Peculiar and, like Abe, has the ability to see the invisible monsters from Abe's stories, ""Hollowgast"" (or ""Hollows""). Hollows are invisible disfigured Peculiar scientists that resulted from killing an Ymbryne in a failed experiment to become immortal by harvesting her powers. Led by shapeshifter Mr. Barron, they hunt Peculiars to consume their eyeballs, which allows them to become ""Wights"", Hollows with regained visible human forms, but with milky-white eyes.
A wounded Ymbryne named Miss Avocet arrives and explains that Barron and the Hollows and Wights raided her January 2016 time loop at Blackpool, England, killed her children, and is trying to repeat his failed experiment by using more Ymbrynes. Jake realized earlier that a Hollow could be in the island after he sees eyeless sheep corpses in the present. Worried, Miss Peregrine decides to move out with her children and Miss Avocet. Jake returns to 2016 and realizes the Hollow is even closer after another victim was killed, so he goes back to the cave to warn his friends. However, he is followed by another visitor on the island, ornithologist John Lamont who reveals himself to be a disguise for Mr. Barron.
Barron reveals that he was about to gain Miss Peregrine's loop from Abe, but his hungry Hollow companion Mr. Malthus killed him before he could. Barron then posed as Dr. Golan and encouraged Jake to go to the island so he could find the loop. Using Jake as a hostage at the children's home, Barron forces Miss Peregrine to trap herself in bird form and takes her to Blackpool, leaving Jake, the children, and Miss Avocet as prey for Malthus. Malthus arrives and kills Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children escape just as the Luftwaffe bomb is about to destroy the house. Without Miss Peregrine to reset it, the house is destroyed and the loop closes, leaving Jake and the children stuck in 1943, but safe from Malthus, who is killed in the explosion. Rescuing a sunken ocean liner, they travel to Blackpool and enter its January 2016 loop, fight Barron's Wight and Hollow allies, and rescue Miss Peregrine and other captive Ymbrynes. Barron disguises himself as Jake, hoping to confuse the children who have come to finish him off. When the last remaining Hollow arrives it mistakes Barron for Jake and kills him, and is in turn killed by Jake.
Before the time loop closes, Emma tells Jake that because of Miss Peregrine's injury in the battle, the children will live in 1943 and that they will handle the Hollows. Jake says goodbye to them as they exit and return to their ship in 1943, while he stays in his year of 2016. He travels back to Florida and relates his adventures to his grandfather, who is alive and well, as Barron’s death in the beginning of 2016 erased his presence in Florida later on. Abe gives Jake a map of international time loops and money from different countries and urges him to seek out Emma.
After months of searching and traveling, Jake reaches Emma and the children in 1943. Emma and Jake confess their feelings, and start traveling along with Miss Peregrine and the other children, searching for a new home."
Deepwater Horizon,"On April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon, an oil drilling rig operated by private contractor Transocean, is set to begin drilling off the southern coast of Louisiana on behalf of BP. Chief Electronics Technician Michael ""Mike"" Williams (Mark Wahlberg) and Offshore Installation Manager James ""Mr. Jimmy"" Harrell (Kurt Russell) are surprised to learn that the workers assigned to test the integrity of recently completed cement work are being sent home early, without conducting a cement bond log (CBL), at the insistence of BP managers Donald Vidrine (John Malkovich) and Robert Kaluza (Brad Leland). While Mike prepares the drilling team, including Caleb Holloway (Dylan O'Brien), Harrell meets with Vidrine and persuades him to conduct a test, which only serves to weaken the already poorly placed cement further. His patience thinning, and without waiting for Harrell to confirm the results, Vidrine orders the well to be flowed.
At first, the operation goes smoothly, but the cement job eventually fails completely, triggering a massive blowout that overpowers and kills Keith Manuel, Shane Roshto, Roy Kemp, Karl Kleppigner, Adam Weise, and Gordon Jones.
A chain of equipment malfunctions, coupled with a failed attempt to seal the well, ignites the oil, killing Dewey Revette, Stephen Curtis, Jason Anderson (Ethan Suplee), and Donald Clark. Andrea Fleytas (Gina Rodriguez), the rig's Dynamic Position Operator, tries to alert the Coast Guard, only to be overruled by her superior, Captain Curt Kuchta, on the grounds that the rig is not in any imminent danger. With oil now spewing into the ocean, a frightened, oil covered pelican flies into the bridge of a nearby vessel and dies, which heads towards the rig just as the workers begin a frantic evacuation. Harrell, still alive, although seriously injured in the explosion, is rescued by Mike and assumes control of the situation, only to discover that the rig could not be saved. Aaron Dale Burkeen, a close friend of Mike's, sacrifices himself to keep a burning crane from collapsing onto the surviving crew, while Mike and Caleb are able to rescue Vidrine and Kaluza and get them to safety.
As night falls and the burning oil lights up the area, the Coast Guard becomes aware of the incident and sends a ship to collect the survivors, who are being ferried in the lifeboats to the Damon Bankston. With all the lifeboats full, Mike locates the emergency life raft, but it becomes separated from the rig before he and Andrea can board, causing the latter to suffer a panic attack. Just as the oil in the well itself ignites and destroys the rig, the two jump into the water and are picked up by rescuers, who then ferry them to the Damon Bankston.
Returned home, the workers reunite with their families in a hotel lobby, during which the father of one of the dead crew members family angrily confronts Mike for failing to save his son, resulting in Mike having a panic attack himself. The film ends with a series of clips showing the aftermath of the disaster, including testimony from the real-life Mike Williams and the revelation that not a single employee of either Transocean or BP was prosecuted for their actions. Pictures appear of the 11 men who lost their lives before the credits. The movie postscript reads: ""The blowout lasted for 87 days, spilling an estimated 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It was the worst oil disaster in U.S. history."""
Masterminds,"In March 1997, Loomis Fargo & Company was robbed of $18.8 million in Jacksonville by company security guard Philip Noel Johnson. This gives Steve Eugene Chambers (Owen Wilson) and Kelly Campbell (Kristen Wiig) the idea to also rob Loomis. They involve Loomis armored car driver David Scott Ghantt (Zach Galifianakis). After some awkward training in preparation for the robbery, the team has David go inside Loomis' vault and load the entire money supply into the company's van. Before he leaves, David takes out three CCTV tapes, but misses one. The next day, David flees to Mexico with $20,000 and takes the cover name ""Michael McKinney"", which is the name of a friend of Steve's. Meanwhile, Steve takes most of the heist, around $17 million.
FBI Special Agent Scanlon (Leslie Jones) and her partner (Jon Daly) take the case, and immediately have David as the prime suspect, but have no idea of Steve's involvement. Steve plans to cut David loose but Kelly thinks it would be wrong to abandon him. In Mexico, David narrowly escapes from the three Interpol agents looking for him, and then calls Kelly about what happened. Unfortunately, he inadvertently learns Steve's name from the ID in a wallet that Kelly gave to him. With his cover blown, Steve hires the real Michael McKinney (Jason Sudeikis) to find and kill David. He travels to Mexico and attempts to shoot David, but the gun backfires and David escapes. David phones Kelly and learns that Steve is trying to kill him, and that Steve will not send the money for him as expected. David is then knocked unconscious by McKinney. When David regains consciousness, McKinney is about to kill him but reconsiders upon looking at ""McKinney""'s birth certificate, thinking that David was born under the same circumstances; they become friends.
David calls Steve, threatening to surrender himself to Interpol if Steve doesn't wire $6 million into his bank account in two days. Kelly is then confronted by Jandice, who, learning of her engagement to David, attacks her. When Steve refuses to wire the money, his two friends kidnap Kelly after her escape from Jandice, and he tells David to get a ticket to South America in exchange for releasing her. At the airport, he meets McKinney, who is returning to the States, but as he bids farewell he sees Kelly's name written on his hand and he tells McKinney that he knows her. Realizing that he can't bring himself to kill her, they switch tickets just as the three Interpol agents show up but he manages to escape.
While Steve is hosting a party, the FBI puts a wire on one of the party members in an attempt to record Steve's confession. Unbeknownst to them, David sneaks in and rescues Kelly. They escape by stealing Steve's BMW but unfortunately the car is destroyed when they try to smash it through the front gate. Steve catches and assaults him, until David realizes he is near the FBI van with the agents inside. David tricks Steve into admitting that he was the mastermind of the whole plan, giving the agents enough reason to arrest all of them, including Kelly. David is sentenced to seven years in prison, while Steve serves 11 years. About $2 million of the money is still unaccounted for. Upon David's release, he is picked up by McKinney and they drive to visit Kelly."
The Girl on the Train,"Rachel Watson is an alcoholic who rides a train aimlessly since losing her job. From the train, she fixates on the lives of her former husband, Tom Watson, and his current wife, Anna, and their neighbors, Scott and Megan Hipwell, whom she idealizes. Megan worked for the Watsons as a nanny, but recently quit.
During her marriage, Rachel became depressed about her infertility and developed a drinking problem that has resulted in continual blackouts and destructive behavior. At a BBQ held by Tom's boss, she drunkenly made a scene and is blamed when Tom is fired.
From the train, Rachel spots Megan kissing a stranger and becomes infuriated at her ruining her marriage. She leaves to confront Megan, but hours later she wakes up in her bed, covered in blood.
Megan disappears and Rachel is questioned by Detective Riley because she was seen in the vicinity that day. Rachel contacts Scott, pretending to be a friend, to tell him about the affair. Scott pulls up a picture of Megan's psychiatrist Dr. Kamal Abdic, and Rachel identifies him as the man she saw. It is alluded to that Megan and Dr. Abdic were involved sexually.
Dr. Abdic told the police Scott was abusive and suspicion shifts to him. Believing Dr. Abdic is involved in Megan's disappearance, Rachel schedules an appointment with him, but discusses her own issues.
Megan is found dead and tests show she was pregnant, but that neither Scott nor Dr. Abdic were the father. Scott confronts Rachel for lying to him about knowing Megan and angrily grabs her. Rachel goes to report the assault, believing Scott murdered Megan, but the detective says he has been ruled out as a suspect.
On the train, Rachel sees Tom's former bosses wife Martha, and apologizes for her behavior, but Martha says she did nothing wrong. Tom had actually been fired for having sex with coworkers. Rachel realizes that Tom planted false memories in her head during her drinking binges.
Anna suspects Tom of cheating and finds a secret phone with text messages on it to another woman, who is revealed to be Megan when Anna calls and hears the voicemail. Rachel goes back to the tunnel and in a flash back remembers that she caught Tom meeting Megan that day, and that Tom attacked her, injuring her.
Rachel goes to warn Anna, and tells her Tom is dangerous and he killed Megan. Anna knows about the affair and when Tom arrives home, both women confront him with details of the affair with Megan. Tom knocks Rachel unconscious and in a flash back, it is revealed that Tom beat Megan to death when she announced her pregnancy and refused to get an abortion.
When Rachel awakens he tries to strangle her, but she gets away. Tom chases her and she stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew, and Anna twists it deeper into Tom's neck, killing him.
Rachel and Anna are interviewed by Detective Riley, and tell identical stories about killing Tom in self-defense, after he admitted to being Megan's killer. Later, a now sober Rachel sits on the opposite side of the train looking forward to the future."
The Birth of a Nation,"Set against the antebellum South, The Birth of a Nation follows Nat Turner (Nate Parker), a literate slave preacher, whose financially strained owner, Samuel Turner (Armie Hammer), accepts an offer to use Nat's preaching to suppress the supposed unruly slaves of multiple southern plantations for profit. As he witnesses countless atrocities by white slave-owning southerners—against himself and his fellow slaves—Nat gathers trusted followers believing that God has selected him as his chosen instrument of freedom and orchestrates an uprising in the hopes of leading his people to freedom."
Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life,"Rafe Khatchadorian (Griffin Gluck), who enjoys a passion for art and has an incredible imagination, transfers mid-year to Hills Village Middle School after being kicked out of his previous one. On his first day, he meets the strict and exceedingly vain Principal Ken Dwight (Andy Daly) and his stern, obsequious Vice-Principal Ida Stricker (Retta). Dwight runs the school with an iron fist and forces students to comply with an extensive list of rules that are mostly senseless and unlawful ones while Stricker follows along with his antics. Later that day, an assembly focused on the BaseLine Assessment of Academic Readiness standardized test, led enthusiastically by Dwight, is interrupted when another student grabs Rafe’s sketchbook in which he had humorously drawn the principal as a zombie repeating “B.L.A.A.R.” over and over. Dwight responds by destroying the sketchbook, much to the dismay of Rafe as it had been filled with his personal work.
Later that day, Rafe is back in his room with his best friend Leo (Thomas Barbusca) who suggests that to get even, Rafe should destroy Dwight’s rule book. To show the ridiculousness of Dwight's rules, Rafe and Leo pull several pranks such as papering the walls of the hallways as well as Dwight’s office with colored sticky notes, changing the period bell to end with the sound of flatulence, filling the teachers’ lounge with plastic balls, putting pink hair dye in Dwight's hat, and turning the trophy case into a fish tank complete with coral and several sea creatures, including an eel. These pranks gain the attention and admiration of Rafe’s fellow students, including Jeanne Galletta (Isabela Moner), the lone member of the AV Club who also sees the pointlessness of Dwight’s rules. Leo suggests strongly to Rafe that he not reveal himself just yet.
In the midst of the chaos, Dwight, obsessed with his school’s performance on the BLAAR, realizes that if he can stop the remedial class, which includes Rafe, from taking the test, then the average scores will improve enough to earn a number one ranking and a generous bonus for him and Stricker. To rig the BLAAR, Dwight frames several students from the class by secretly putting items in their lockers that make it appear like they were responsible for the pranks, and suspends the whole class for a week. He also uses the opportunity to unlawfully fire Mr. Teller (Adam Pally), the compassionate remedial class teacher who, along with the other teachers, disagrees with Dwight and Stricker's antics and sees through Dwight's plan. Rafe immediately goes to Dwight’s office and begs him not to suspend the other students since he was the one responsible for the pranks; when Dwight refuses, Rafe creates a crazy dance party by activating the sprinkler system and fire alarm, which soaks the school and the students in colored dye that was intended to be yet another one of his pranks, which prompts Dwight to expel Rafe permanently.
Now expelled from Hills Village Middle School, Rafe is confronted by his mother Jules (Lauren Graham) who tells him that her fiancé Carl “Bear” (Rob Riggle), who seriously loathes Rafe and his sister Georgia (Alexa Nisenson), has found a military school where Jules should consider sending him. While acknowledging that it is not ideal, it represents what may be the only option left. She also pauses to reflect the passing of Rafe’s younger brother Leo, two years earlier, revealing that Leo had been imagined the whole time. Later that evening, Jeanne shows up at Rafe’s house with concrete evidence: a VHS tape containing a documentary about the school she had recorded of Dwight putting the items ""found"" in the student lockers himself. With this evidence, Rafe, Jeanne, and Georgia gather the suspended students from the remedial class outside the middle school, along with the disgruntled janitor Gus (Efren Ramirez), who also dislikes Dwight's rules, and pull together a plan to get revenge on Dwight and Stricker.
The next morning, Jules discovers that neither Rafe nor Georgia are home and becomes concerned about their disappearance, but when Bear shows more concern in the fact that his car (a red stick-shift 2009 BMW 328i (E90) sedan with doors that sometimes jam when opening) is missing as it was stolen by the kids, she finally realizes that he is nothing more than a selfish jerk, as Rafe claimed.
Meanwhile, with B.L.A.A.R. testing ready to begin, Rafe and his classmates interrupt procedures and expose Dwight’s deceitfulness. Fed up with Rafe’s inferred disobedience, Dwight begins to chase him, but one of the students trips Dwight, so Stricker begins to chase Rafe but ends up getting tripped as well. Gus shows up in a cart to pick up Rafe. Dwight then steals a student's bike and gives chase, only to have a pile of manure dumped all over him. Just as Dwight catches up with Rafe and Gus, Mr. Teller arrives with Superintendent Hwang (Angela Oh) to whom Rafe hands over the video proving Dwight’s guilt. He and Stricker are subsequently fired by Hwang for creating unlawful rules, unlawfully firing Mr. Teller, and for illegally rigging the B.L.A.A.R. Hwang also reveals that she will bring their crimes to court. When Jules arrives to pick up Rafe and Georgia, Rafe is re-enrolled, she breaks up with Bear, and gives him back the engagement ring to pay for the damages to his car (courtesy of Georgia).
Rafe is later seen that night outside the school conversing with Leo, who tells him that since Rafe has now made friends with some of his classmates, he is no longer needed to fill that void. As Leo departs on a spaceship with aliens that Rafe has created in his earlier sketchbook, Rafe and Jeanne share a kiss, breaking rule #86 which is the final rule Rafe needed to break for an ends justify the means deed."
The Accountant,"As a child, Christian Wolff is diagnosed with a high-functioning form of autism at Harbor Neuroscience, where he meets the doctor's daughter, Justine. Chris's father declines the offer for his son to stay at a sensory friendly environment, believing that Chris must overcome the hardships inherent in his condition, but Chris's overwhelmed mother abandons their family. Afraid that others will exploit his son, Chris's father—a US Army PSYOP officer—begins a brutal regimen of stoicism and martial arts training for both him and his brother, Braxton.
In the present, Chris works as a forensic accountant from a small strip mall office in Plainfield, Illinois. He unmasks insider financial deceptions, often for criminal and terrorist enterprises. Chris's clients interact with Chris through the Voice, an unidentified woman who calls him ""Dreamboat"". He exposes himself to loud music and flashing lights while abusing his own shinbone on a daily basis to inure himself to sensory overload.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) Director Ray King pursues Chris, known to them as ""the Accountant"". King recruits Treasury data analyst Marybeth Medina to help him locate the Accountant. Her leads include Chris's cover names, a recording from his killing of nine members of the Gambino crime family, and some photos.
Chris is hired to audit Living Robotics after the company's founder and CEO, Lamar Blackburn and his sister Rita, learn of discrepancies from in-house accountant Dana Cummings. Chris finds that over $61 million has been embezzled from the company. CFO Ed Chilton, who is diabetic, is forced by a hitman to commit suicide from an insulin overdose. Lamar dismisses Chris, claiming Chilton killed himself because of the investigation of the embezzlement, leaving Chris very distraught because he cannot finish the audit.
In a flashback scene, the extent of Chris and his brother's relentless martial arts training instilled by their father as a child is revealed, suggesting that he is an adept fighter in the present day.
As a result of his superior self defense capabilities, assassins fail to kill Chris; the last reveals that Dana is the next target. Chris saves her before taking her to his storage unit, containing an Airstream Panamerica with artwork and other valuables, which he uses to quickly flee in when necessary. As they talk, he realizes that the embezzlement at Living Robotics is a scheme like Crazy Eddie's; money stolen from the company is returned to it, boosting profits and increasing the company's valuation as it prepares for an IPO. When Chris goes to confront Rita he finds her dead, exposing Lamar as the embezzler.
Medina isolates Chris's voice from the recording of the Gambino killing, hearing him repeating the nursery rhyme Solomon Grundy. She learns that his cadence is reminiscent of those with autism, and that Chris's aliases are famed mathematicians, including his current identity, Christian Wolff. Using IRS records, she finds his Illinois office.
Government agents search Chris's heavily secured home. King explains to Medina that Chris was imprisoned at Leavenworth because of a fight at his estranged mother's funeral, where his father was killed protecting Chris. He learned accounting from Francis Silverberg, a Gambino family accountant who became an FBI informant. King was Silverberg's handler, but his inaction led to the informant being brutally killed; King was staking out the Gambinos when Chris came to avenge his mentor. Chris could have killed King, but let him go after asking if he was a good father. King began getting information from the Voice when criminals violated Chris's moral code, and King became director of FinCen. King tells Medina someone has to take over when he retires. The phone rings, and the Voice tells Medina about Living Robotics.
Chris goes to Lamar's mansion, where the hitman and his men await. During the battle, the hitman recognizes Chris repeating the nursery rhyme and reveals that he is Chris's brother Braxton; they have not seen each other since Chris's imprisonment. Braxton attacks Chris, as he is both resentful over his brother's estrangement from him and blames him for their father's death. During a pause in their fight Lamar arrogantly interrupts; Chris shoots him, ending the battle. Chris amicably agrees to meet Braxton in a week, saying he will find him.
As another set of parents visits Harbor Neuroscience with their child, the boy meets Justine, still a patient there; she is the Voice, and Chris funds the center with his bookkeeping profits. Dana receives a Jackson Pollock painting she saw in the trailer, as Chris drives out of town with the Airstream in tow."

Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,"After dismantling a human trafficking ring, former military investigator turned vigilante drifter Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner, whom he has been working with during his travels and his closest friend – only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained.
Turner's attorney, Colonel Bob Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute.
Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two assassins arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the assassin, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor.
Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen. Reacher and Turner decide to escort Samantha to Turner's old private school for protection, but discover that she has her mobile phone with her and that the enemy probably knows exactly where they are. They discard the phone and make a quick exit, during which Samantha steals a backpack from one of the students to use the credit cards.
Reacher, Turner and Samantha travel to New Orleans in search of Daniel Prudhomme, the only eye-witness to the murders for which Turner has been framed. They find him in a derelict warehouse filled with drug addicts and learn that Prudhomme is connected to Parasource, a private military organization that is trying to cover up the murders. Reacher contacts Turner's friend, Captain Anthony Espin, to move Prudhomme into custody, but they are ambushed by assassins and Prudhomme is killed, while Reacher rescues a wounded Espin and finds out that the assassins are Parasource contractors. Parasource's CEO, General James Harkness, then sends the Hunter to capture Samantha after she uses a credit card to order room service.
Reacher and Turner, along with Espin, acting on information provided by Prudhomme, intercept a flight of weapons due to enter the country, where they confront Harkness and his men and accuse them of corruption. Upon opening the crates, however, Espin finds weapons as declared in the flight manifest. Before Turner can be re-arrested, Reacher opens up one of the weapons and discovers that they are filled with opium. They learn that Harkness framed Turner, who had been investigating his activities, for the murders of two soldiers who discovered that Harkness was selling weapons to insurgents and smuggling drugs into the United States. Espin and his men then arrest Harkness, clearing Reacher's and Turner's names.
The Hunter and his men locate and chase Samantha through the streets to lure Reacher into a confrontation. Turner kills one of the assassins, whilst Reacher takes out another one on the rooftop. The Hunter captures Samantha and threatens to kill her, but she manages to escape and steal his gun. Reacher then tackles the Hunter onto another rooftop, briefly incapacitating both of them, and they have a vicious fight that culminates with Reacher breaking the Hunter's arm, leg and neck, before dropping him off the rooftop. Reacher then admits to Samantha he might be her father.
Following Harkness' arrest, Turner is reinstated in her old position and goes back to her office, where her colleagues and a recovering Captain Espin all welcome her back. Reacher promises to keep in touch before meeting Samantha at a diner to meet Candice, Samantha's mother, whom Reacher surmises he will recognize, as he remembers every woman he has slept with. Samantha reveals that the waitress that had been serving him is in fact Candice, and that Reacher cannot be her father, as neither had recognized each other. Reacher and Samantha then reluctantly part.
A short time later, while Reacher is walking along a road, he is surprised when a phone Samantha had slipped into his pocket rings. He finds a text message from her reading, ""Miss me yet?"". Reacher smiles as he sticks out his thumb to hitch a ride."
Keeping Up with the Joneses,"Jeff Gaffney (Zach Galifianakis) works as a Human Resources professional at a Defense contractor company called MBI, based in Atlanta. He and his wife Karen (Isla Fisher) live in a nice cul-de-sac with their two children, who are away at summer camp. They make the acquaintance of their two new neighbors, Tim (Jon Hamm) and Natalie Jones (Gal Gadot). Tim is a travel writer whose hobbies include glassblowing, and Natalie is a social media consultant, cooking blogger and philanthropist. They are both impossibly good-looking, accomplished and stylish, yet overly friendly with the Gaffneys.
Karen starts having suspicions about the Joneses when she catches Tim poking around Jeff's den during a neighborhood block party, then witnesses Natalie doing what looks like a dead drop in a café. Karen follows Natalie to the mall, but Natalie confronts her in a dressing room, defusing the situation with some female bonding. Meanwhile, Tim invites Jeff to an underground Chinese restaurant, where Jeff drinks snake wine and is bitten by a severed snake head, forcing Tim to save his life. In exchange, Jeff takes Tim to indoor skydiving, a passion of his that none of his friends share. All the way through, Tim tries to have Jeff talk about his coworkers at the office. One night, with the help of Natalie, Tim sneaks into the MBI building and look over Jeff's emails.
Back at their house, Jeff accidentally breaks the glass sculpture made by Tim that was given to them, revealing a bug among the shards. Realizing the Joneses are spies, Karen decides to sneak into their house to find more evidence. They discover files on Jeff and the other MBI employees and Jeff accidentally stuns Karen with a pen gun. They narrowly escape as the Joneses arrive. Natalie is worried Tim might be getting too close to Jeff, but they reveal they are in love with each other, which is also against the rules. Natalie notices the used pen gun on the floor, and they realize the Gaffneys have broken into their house.
The Gaffneys arrange a private meeting with MBI security officer Carl Pronger (Kevin Dunn) to expose the Joneses, but before Carl can disclose classified details, he is killed by a sniper who also attacks the Gaffneys. They are rescued by the Joneses and a high-speed chase and shootout ensue. The Gaffneys learn that the Joneses are actually trying to discover whether there is treason within MBI. Back in the cul-de-sac, Jeff gives Tim and Natalie some relationship advice and the two couples bond. After they reenter their house, the Joneses trigger a bomb that blows it up.
Later, after lying to the police about the Joneses, the Gaffneys are frantically preparing to go on the run when the Joneses reappear alive and well in their basement. They kidnapped Jeff's colleague Dan Craverston (Matt Walsh) and his wife Meg (Maribeth Monroe), who are revealed to be trying to sell MBI's experimental microchips to an international arms dealer called ""The Scorpion"" (Patton Oswalt). When the Scorpion calls on Dan's phone, Jeff answers posing as Dan and arranges a meeting to deliver the microchips.
Jeff and Karen go to the hotel where the meeting takes place, while the Joneses back them up from the roof. The Scorpion turns out to be a former MBI employee named Bruce Springstine, who recognizes Jeff. With their cover blown, Tim radios for back-up, but the operation is aborted and the Gaffneys are declared collateral damage. The Joneses disobey orders and surrender to the Scorpion, but before the latter gets around to killing them, Karen is able to pass a knife to Natalie, giving the Joneses the opportunity to eliminate the Scorpion's henchmen. They escape by jumping off the window into a pool, just before the Scorpion opens the briefcase containing the chips, detonating a bomb that kills him. Proud of their new friends, the Joneses say goodbye and go back to their life of espionage.
The next summer, the Gaffneys visit the café in Marrakesh where the Joneses used to date and happen upon the Joneses who are in the middle of a new mission, accidentally blowing their cover and triggering yet another gunfight."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,"In 1967 Los Angeles, a widow named Alice Zander works out of her suburban home as a spiritual medium, accompanied by her daughters, 15-year-old Paulina ""Lina"" and 9-year old Doris. The family is still reeling over the recent death of Roger, Alice's husband and the kids' father. At Lina's suggestion, Alice incorporates a Ouija board into her readings. While trying out the board, she unknowingly contacts a spirit named Marcus that begins to possess Doris.
Alice receives a notice that the bank intends to foreclose on their home. Doris contacts the board for help, believing she is communicating with her dead father. The spirit leads her to a secret compartment behind the basement wall containing a pouch of cash. When she gives the money to her mother, the family has a Ouija session, believing they can contact Roger. When the board answers a question only Roger would know the answer to, a thrilled Alice begins believing that they are in contact with her dead husband.
Soon, Doris becomes possessed by a shadowy spirit. Lina, who is becoming disturbed by the changes in her sister, finds papers written by Doris in fluent Polish, a language she does not know, and brings them to Father Tom to translate. Troubled, Father Tom visits them for a Ouija session under the pretense of contacting his dead wife Gloria. Although the session appears to be successful, Father Tom later explains to Alice and Lina that Doris did not contact Gloria. Instead, for every question he asked, she read his thoughts and repeated the answers he was thinking in his mind. He reveals that the pages are entries written by a Polish immigrant named Marcus, who was taken captive during World War II by a sadistic doctor who conducted experiments on him and other captives inside the house's basement. These spirits knew answers that only Roger would know because they have been watching the family since the day they moved in.
Meanwhile, Doris kills Lina's boyfriend Mikey. When they find the body, Father Tom, Alice, and Lina burn the Ouija board in the furnace. Father Tom finds the secret room where the experiments were conducted, and is possessed by the spirits. He attacks Alice and Lina, but momentarily seizes clarity, only to be killed by Doris. Alice is captured, while Roger's spirit carries an unconscious Lina to her bed. Recalling an earlier moment when her doll's mouth was stitched by her father's spirit ""to shut out the voices"", she realizes she must sew Doris' mouth shut to quiet the spirits' voices and stop the evil. She fights off the embodied evil spirits to do so but kills Doris in the process, reuniting with her father. The spirits possess Lina and stab Alice. As she dies, Alice sees Roger and Doris together.
Lina is committed in a mental hospital for the suspected murder of her mother. She tells her doctor that she knows she will never be alone again. Later, Lina summons Doris's evil spirit with a make-shift Ouija board.
In a post-credits scene, 47 years later, a now elderly and still institutionalized Lina receives a visit from someone claiming to be her niece."

American Pastoral,"In 1996, at the 45th-year reunion of the class of '51 at Weequahic High School in Newark, New Jersey, writer Nathan Zuckerman meets one of his old friends, Jerry Levov. They talk about Jerry's older brother, former all-state star athlete Seymour (""Swede""), class of '44, who recently died after a long illness.
The story moves back to a young Swede persuading his father, glovemaking magnate Lou Levov, to let him marry his high school sweetheart, New Jersey's 1947 Miss America contestant Dawn Dwyer. Lou is skeptical because Swede is Jewish and Dawn is a devout Roman Catholic, but her strength and honesty sways him. They have a daughter, Meredith (""Merry""), and settle in the town of Old Rimrock, where they acquire a large farm, with Swede commuting the 30 miles to the Newark glove factory.
Merry struggles with a stuttering problem, which her parents are unable to get a handle on – though Grandpa Lou says it is simply because her mind works so fast. Merry is smart and quirky, and is deeply affected as a 12-year-old by the self-immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. By the time Merry reaches high school, she has become increasingly radicalized as the Vietnam War rages, and frequently goes to New York City to take part in antiwar protests. When Merry lashes out during the 1967 Newark riots, Swede urges her to channel her energy into protesting against the war from closer to home. A few days later, the town's little post office and store is destroyed by a bomb, killing the owner.
Merry disappears, and is the FBI's prime suspect, though Swede and Dawn believe she is innocent or, if involved, being forced to act by older radicals she met in New York. Swede searches for her, hounding the FBI for information, but she is not heard from. Some time later, 22-year-old university student Rita Cohen presents herself at the glovemaking factory, ostensibly working on a report for business class. Rita tips off Swede with credible information about Merry, hints that she knows Merry's whereabouts, then asks him to meet her at a hotel with $10,000 cash. Swede meets Rita in the hotel room, but spurns her mean-spirited attempts to seduce him. Rita runs off with the money and leaves no further information regarding Merry. Swede calls in the FBI, pointing to the Rita connection and the recent bombing in the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, but the agency has no more use for Swede's inept interference.
The strain of Merry's disappearance eventually causes Dawn to have a nervous breakdown. After treatment, Dawn starts an affair with a neighbour, tells Swede that Merry has destroyed their former life, and tries to get Swede to forget about Merry so that they can start a new life. He refuses to stop looking.
In 1970, Swede spots Rita on a New York City street. Rita takes him to a skid-row area of Newark where Merry now lives. During two brief visits, Merry confesses to Swede that she made and planted a total of 3 bombs, killing 4 people. She tells of how she later slid into the underground, where she was taken robbed and raped repeatedly. As a penance for her crimes, she has withdrawn from society, and is practicing extreme asceticism within the Indian religion Jainism (though the quietness of her physically dirty and simple life style has ended her stutter). She has no desire to return home, and says that if he loves her, he'll let her be. We see the years pass in a series of shots of Swede growing older as he keeps returning to stand outside the abandoned house where he last found Merry. Swede never sees Merry again.
In the present, at Swede's funeral, Nathan muses that we know we are alive when we realize that ""all the time... we are wrong"" about our assumptions ""about everyone"". As the mourners are leaving, a cleaned up middle-aged Merry arrives, silently passing her uncle and mother as she walks to Swede's grave."
Inferno,"Harvard University professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital room in Florence, Italy, with no memory of what has transpired over the last few days, but being plagued with visions of a scorched Earth. Dr. Sienna Brooks, one of the doctors tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as a result of a bullet wound to the head. Another doctor says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots the doctor while heading down the hall. Sienna helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment.
Among Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Sienna find a Faraday pointer, a miniature image projector with a modified version of Sandro Botticelli's Map of Hell, which itself is based on Dante's Inferno. They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire geneticist who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to reduce the Earth's growing population, and who committed suicide after being chased by armed government agents.
Langdon and Sienna figure out that Zobrist, who is obsessed with Dante, has created a virus he has dubbed ""Inferno"", with the potential of decimating the world's population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and agents from the World Health Organization (WHO), who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The WHO agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's, and are trying to prevent the release of the virus. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called ""The Consortium"", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability.
Langdon's knowledge of Dante's work and history, and of hidden passages in Florence, allows the two to follow clues such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and Venice, while killing Vayentha and evading the WHO. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he stole and hid the Dante Death Mask, a crucial clue, an event he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the virus, to be broadcast after it has been released. Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Sienna are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man purporting to be working for WHO, warning them that Sinskey has a double agenda and is after the Inferno virus for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again.
Langdon figures out that the virus is in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. With that knowledge, Sienna abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the virus. Zobrist and Sienna used to play treasure hunt games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard, but Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals he was hired by Sienna to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with benzodiazepine to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were all staged.
They realize the virus is in a plastic bag hidden under water in the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The WHO team–along with Langdon, Sims, and Sinskey race to locate and secure the bag, while Sienna and her allies attempt to detonate an explosive that will rupture the bag and aerosolize the virus. Sims is killed by Sienna, and when Langdon confronts her, she commits suicide in an attempt to release the virus. The detonation is able to rupture the bag but because it was already contained in a special containment unit, the virus was secured in time and Sienna's allies are killed. The virus is then taken by WHO, and Langdon goes back to Florence in order to return the Dante Death Mask."

Later, Laura notices the picture of Olivia from Marina's page, the picture slowly melts, implying that she is next. Laura attempts to call her, but Olivia has turned off her phone, alongside laptop. Olivia is attacked by Marina with wasps and taken into the hospital. When Tyler and Detective Cameron are talking, Marina possesses Olivia through the heart monitor and lunges at detective Cameron's partner, taking the gun from him. Instead of shooting the officer, she shoots herself in the head, killing Olivia.
Meanwhile, Laura hunts down the place where Marina committed suicide in order to destroy the black mirror that turned Marina into an evil spirit, she and Kobe go to Marina's house which was burnt down and attempt to look for her. While there, Kobe sees an ethereal entity come out of the basement and approaches him, but disappears when Laura bumps into him. Laura tells him that Marina is not there, but he suggests that they look in the basement.
Marina is not found in the basement, but while searching, Kobe is separated from Laura, who finds him staring into a black mirror. When she turns him around and asks what's wrong, he apologizes to Laura and says that she can't be lonely if she died. Kobe suddenly stabs her in the stomach, hoping to kill her in order to save himself and Tyler. Laura hits him with her flashlight and escapes from the basement as Kobe gives the chase but loses her. Laura then realizes through one of Marina's posts that Marina committed suicide in one of the nearby factories.
Meanwhile, Tyler finds a deranged Kobe looking for Laura. After getting a call, Tyler and Kobe head to the factories as well, but he tells Kobe to stay in the car while he tried to find Laura. Once getting to the factories, a wounded Laura starts looking for Marina's body, she receives a video call from her mother, Caroline, who informs that she's been seeing Marina too. Laura's video call begins to glitch out as her mother begins to act strangely, a sign that she may be attacked by Marina. Caroline takes a knife from the table and goes to the other room, presumably killing herself as the connection times out. Devastated by her mother's presumed death, Laura begins to cry after seeing everyone she's loved being taken away. Tyler soon finds her, only their reunion is cut short when Kobe appears and stabs Tyler in the throat, killing him. Laura attempts to escape Kobe once again but reaches a dead end. However, before he can kill Laura, Kobe is violently attacked and killed by the pack of wasps.
Laura, feeling dazed, sees an apparition of two boys (presumably the boys that bullied Marina in the orphanage). Laura yells at Marina, asking what she wants from her, the spirit of younger Marina appears and says that she wanted to be best friends with her as she leads Laura to Marina's rotten corpse and her laptop which transports Laura into one of Marina's earlier posts. Laura is then lunged at by a demonic Marina.
Some time has passed and there are fresh batch of students. Laura is seen looking at some girls in the same way that Marina looked at Laura and her friends in the beginning. Laura then faces her laptop (which actually is Marina's laptop) and is shown to have zero friends, just like Marina before she met Laura. Then her new account  – which shares the same dark, grotesque images and renamed as Lau Ra –  is revealed. The camera shows Laura's eyes are green and blue, implying that Marina has possessed Laura."
23,"On the Polynesian island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess Te Fiti, who brought life to the ocean, using a pounamu stone as her heart and the source of her power. Maui, the shapeshifting demigod and master of sailing, steals the heart to give humanity the power of creation. However, Te Fiti disintegrates, and Maui is attacked by Te Kā, a volcanic demon, losing both his magical giant fishhook and the heart to the depths.
A millennium later, Moana, daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, is chosen by the ocean to return the heart to Te Fiti. However, Tui arrives and takes Moana away, causing her to lose the heart. Tui and Moana's mother Sina try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare for her ascension as the island's chief. Years later, after Moana has grown older, a blight strikes the island, rotting the coconuts and dwindling the number of fish caught. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef to find more fish, but Tui forbids it. Sina explains to Moana that Tui and his best friend tried going beyond the reef, but the latter perished. Moana and her pet pig Pua try conquering the reef but are overpowered by the ocean's tides and end up shipwrecked back on Motunui.
Moana's grandmother Tala shows her a secret cave, where a number of ships are hidden, revealing to Moana that their people used to be voyagers. Tala explains they stopped when Maui stole Te Fiti's heart and that Te Kā's darkness is poisoning the island, but it can be cured if Moana finds Maui and gets him to restore the heart of Te Fiti, which she gives to Moana. Tala falls ill shortly after and dies, but not before encouraging Moana to go and fulfill her destiny.
Moana sets sail on a camakau found in the cavern, accidentally accompanied by her dim-witted rooster Heihei. Moana is caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island where she finds the stranded Maui, who traps her and steals the camakau, but Moana catches up to him with help from the ocean. She demands that Maui return the heart but he refuses. Maui is accompanied by a sentient ""Mini-Maui"" tattoo, acting as his conscience.
They are attacked by Kakamora—coconut-armored pirates—who seek to steal the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them. Moana realizes Maui is no longer a hero, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. Maui first needs to obtain his magical fishhook, which is located in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, and is in the possession of Tamatoa, a giant, greedy coconut crab. Moana enters Tamatoa's lair, using herself as live bait to distract him and allowing Maui to climb atop the crab and retrieve his fishhook. However, Maui discovers he cannot control his shapeshifting and loses self-confidence, quickly becoming overpowered by Tamatoa. Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with Maui's hook. Maui reveals that his first tattoo was earned when his mortal parents rejected him. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of sailing and regains control of his powers.
The two arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te Kā, who badly damages Maui's fishhook. Tired of all the trials and tribulations and fearful he will lose his hook, and therefore his power, Maui angrily abandons Moana, who tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart from Moana. Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. Moana decides to fulfill her destiny, retrieves the heart, and sails back to confront Te Kā. Maui returns, convinced by his Mini-Maui tattoo to change his mind, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te Kā, destroying his fishhook in the process. Moana discovers Te Fiti is missing, and realizes Te Kā is Te Fiti without her heart. Moana tells the ocean to clear a path while singing, allowing her to restore Te Fiti's heart, transforming her back to normal. Te Fiti then heals the ocean and islands of Te Kā's poison. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who forgivingly restores his fishhook and goes into a deep sleep. Moana bids farewell to Maui, returning home where she reunites with her parents. Moana takes up her role as chief and wayfinder, leading her people on a voyage, accompanied from afar by Maui (in a form of a giant hawk) and Tala (in the form of a manta ray).
In a post-credits scene, Tamatoa, still stuck on his back, addresses the audience, knowing they would help if he was named Sebastian and sang in a Jamaican accent (making reference to The Little Mermaid)."
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (film),"Research scientist Galen Erso and his family are in hiding on the planet Lah'mu when Imperial weapons developer Orson Krennic arrives to press him into completing the Death Star, a space station-based superweapon capable of destroying entire planets. Galen's wife, Lyra, is killed in the confrontation while their daughter, Jyn, escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist Saw Gerrera.
Thirteen years later, cargo pilot Bodhi Rook defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message recorded by Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon Jedha. After learning about the Death Star from an agent at the trading outpost Ring of Kafrene, Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor frees Jyn from an Imperial labor camp at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader Mon Mothma, who convinces her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him.
Jyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed Imperial droid K-2SO travel to Jedha, where the Empire is removing kyber crystals from the holy city to power the Death Star while Gerrera and his partisans are engaged in an armed insurgency against them. With the aid of blind spiritual warrior Chirrut Îmwe and his mercenary friend Baze Malbus, Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, who has been holding Rook captive. Gerrera shows her the message, in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics from an Imperial data bank on the planet Scarif.
On the Death Star, Krennic orders a low-powered test shot which destroys Jedha's capital. Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon, but Gerrera remains to die with the city. Grand Moff Tarkin congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the project. Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet Eadu, where Cassian chooses not to kill Galen. Jyn makes her presence known moments before Rebel bombers attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in his daughter's arms, before she escapes with her group on board a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by Darth Vader to answer for the attack on Eadu. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the Emperor, but Vader instead orders him to ensure no further breaches occur.
Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics using the Rebel fleet but fails to gain approval from the Alliance Council, who feel victory against the Empire is now impossible. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group lead a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the databank themselves. Arriving at Scarif on the stolen Imperial ship, which Rook dubs ""Rogue One"", a disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with K-2SO while the other Rebels attack the resident Imperial garrison as a diversion. The Rebel fleet learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploy in support. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Îmwe is killed after activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Malbus dies in battle shortly afterwards. Rook is killed by a grenade after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the shield surrounding the planet to allow the transmission of the schematics. Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics, but they are ambushed by Krennic, who is eventually shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship. The Death Star enters orbit above Scarif, where Tarkin uses another low-power shot to destroy the compromised base, killing Krennic, Cassian, and Jyn.
The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to hyperspace, but many of the fleet's ships are intercepted by Vader's flagship. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and attempts to regain the schematics, but a small starship escapes with the plans on board. Aboard the fleeing ship, Princess Leia declares that the schematics will provide hope for the Rebellion."
The Founder,"Ray Kroc is a traveling salesman selling Prince Castle brand milkshake mixers in 1954 without much success. While he has a supportive wife, Ethel, and has saved enough to live a simple and comfortable life in Arlington Heights, Illinois, he craves more. Kroc also observes that many of the drive-in restaurants that he tries to sell to are inefficiently run, with a long waiting time for orders and carhops more concerned with avoiding the groping from greasers than getting the orders right. After learning that a drive-in in San Bernardino is ordering an unusually large number of milkshake mixers, Ray drives to California to see it. What he finds is McDonald's—a highly popular walk-up restaurant with fast service, high-quality food, disposable packaging, and a family-friendly atmosphere.
Ray meets with the two McDonald brothers, Maurice ""Mac"" and Richard ""Dick"" McDonald. Mac gives Ray a tour of the kitchens and he notes the employees' strong work ethic. Dick explains the high-quality food and lightning-fast service are the backbones of their diner. Ray takes the brothers to dinner and is told the origin story of McDonald's. The next day, Ray suggests that the brothers franchise the restaurant, but they hesitate; pointing out that they already tried, only to have encountered absentee franchisees who were lackadaisical in upholding their system. Ray persists and eventually convinces the brothers to allow him to lead their franchising efforts on the condition that he agree to a contract which requires all changes to receive the McDonald brothers' approval in writing.
Initially, Ray begins building a McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois while attempting to entice wealthy investors (specifically fellow members at the country club) to open franchises, but encounters the same poor management ethic which doomed the original franchise efforts. After encountering a dedicated Bible salesman who is Jewish, Ray hits on the idea of franchising to middle-class investors, who have more incentive to be hands-on and are willing to follow the McDonald's formula. This proves successful, and new franchises begin opening across the Midwest, with Ray representing himself as the creator of McDonald's. During this time, Ray meets Rollie Smith, an upscale restaurant owner in Minnesota who wishes to invest, and his wife Joan, to whom Ray is immediately attracted.
Despite his success, Ray begins to encounter financial difficulties as his share of franchise profits is limited due to his contract, a share that the brothers decline to renegotiate. The brothers also refuse to allow the use of sponsorships for fear of ruining the image of their restaurants. Meanwhile, the owners are encountering higher than expected costs, particularly for refrigeration of large quantities of ice cream for milkshakes. Joan suggests a powdered milkshake to Ray as a way to avoid these costs, but the McDonald brothers consider it degrading to their food quality. Ray is also called to the bank as his mortgage is past due, but this is overheard by Harry Sonneborn, a financial consultant for Tastee-Freez, who requests to review Ray's books. Sonneborn realizes that the real profit opportunity is in providing real estate to the franchisees, which will not only provide a revenue stream, but give Ray leverage over his franchisees and the McDonald brothers. Ray incorporates a new company, Franchise Realty Corporation, and attracts new investors. This move upsets the brothers and emboldens Ray: He increasingly defies them by circumventing their authority and providing powdered milkshakes to all franchisees. Ray also divorces Ethel, she gets all his assets except any shares in his business.
Ray renames his company to The McDonald's Corporation and demands to be released from his contract and buy the brothers out, the news of which sends Mac into diabetic shock. Ray visits him in the hospital and offers a blank check to settle their business. The brothers agree to a $2.7 million lump sum payment, ownership of their original restaurant in San Bernardino, and a 1% annual royalty, but when the time comes to finalize the agreement, Ray refuses to include the royalty in the settlement and instead offers it as a handshake deal. Afterwards, in the men's room, Dick asks Ray why he had to take over their business, when he could have easily stolen their idea and recreated it. Ray reveals that the true value of McDonald's is the name itself, which expresses all the attributes of Americana (vs his Czech Slavic-sounding name of Kroc).
The McDonald brothers are forced to take their own name off the original restaurant and Ray opens a new McDonald's franchise directly across the street from the original restaurant to finally put the McDonald brothers out of business. The film closes in 1970 with him preparing a speech where he praises himself for his success in his elaborate mansion with his new wife, Joan. An epilogue reveals that the McDonald brothers were never paid their royalties, which could have been in the area of $100 million a year."
21,"In a world of anthropomorphic animals, koala Buster Moon owns a theater, having been interested in show business since his father took him to his first music show as a child. Following financial problems brought up by the bank representative Judith, he tells his wealthy friend Eddie that he will host a singing competition with a prize of $1,000. But Buster's assistant, Miss Crawly, accidentally appends making the prize money to $100,000 and the promotional fliers showing $100,000 are blown out of Buster's office into the city streets.
Animals from all around the city gather for auditions. Those selected include housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; street musician mouse Mike; mobster's son gorilla Johnny; and punk-rock porcupine Ash. Shy teenage elephant Meena fails her audition out of stage fright, while Ash's boyfriend Lance is dismissed from the contest. Rosita is paired with another contestant, an exuberant pig named Gunter, for a dance routine. Although Buster discovers the flyers show a prize of $100,000 (money he does not have), he remains optimistic. Buster convinces Eddie to arrange a visit with Eddie's grandmother, former opera singer and theater actress Nana Noodleman, to persuade her to sponsor the prize money. She is hesitant to contribute but agrees to see a private screening of the show.
Encouraged by her grandfather, Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance, but becomes his stage hand instead. When one of the acts quits, and another is injured, Meena is added as an act. The performers' individual problems begin to hinder rehearsals: Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, after having been distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray. After discovering Lance with a new girlfriend and evicting them from her apartment, Ash is devastated and can no longer sing her assigned song, Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe."" Johnny is torn between having to help his father as the driver of a getaway car in a heist and making the practices. When he tries to do both, he does not show up for the planned pickup in time, and his father and his gang are arrested. Meena does not get any help in overcoming her stage fright, and Mike, certain that the prize money is as good as his, buys a fancy car to impress a female mouse, and then swindles a group of bears in a card game at a nightclub.
The day of the screening, the bears interrupt the show, demanding the money from Mike, who in turn, points to Buster. The bears open the chest containing the prize money, but it is nowhere near $100,000. The glass tank full of luminescent squids that Buster got to light up the theater breaks under all their weight, flooding the theater, which then comes crashing down. With the lot repossessed by Judith, Buster, who had been living in his theater's office desk, takes up residence at Eddie's place (his parents' pool house). Although the contestants (except Mike, who saw Buster as a fraud) visit him and try to cheer him up, Buster is too despondent to listen to them. He tries to start over by opening a car wash, using the same bucket that his father had used to earn money for Buster's theater.
When Meena goes to the theater's rubble lot and sings Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money. They perform on a makeshift stage on the lot in front of Rosita and Meena's family members. As Rosita and Gunter perform Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off,"" more animals are attracted to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news. Johnny's rendition of Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"" impresses his father, who then escapes from prison to reconcile with him. Despite an interruption by Judith, Ash sings her original rock song ""Set It All Free."" Mike returns to the show and sings Frank Sinatra's ""My Way."" Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings Stevie Wonder's ""Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing,"" which literally brings down the house. The show becomes a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. Nana buys the lot and the theater is rebuilt and reopened."
23,"Twelve-year-old Connor O'Malley must face his mother's terminal cancer, his strict grandmother, his estranged father, and his school bully, Harry. One night at 12:07 a.m., Connor is visited by the tree-like Monster, who tells Connor it has come to tell him three true stories, after which Connor must tell the Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Connor refuses to do.
An old king who has lost his entire family (his sons were killed in fierce battles and his wife committing suicide because of this) save a young grandson, remarries a beautiful young woman. He dies before the prince comes of age, and many believe the queen poisoned the king. Not wanting to hand the kingdom over to the prince in a year, she plots to marry the prince and remain queen. The prince runs away with a farm girl he loves. They stop and sleep under a yew tree (the Monster), but in the morning he finds the young woman murdered. The prince tells the villagers that the queen, a witch, must have done it, and they rally to overthrow her. Before the commoners can reach the queen, the Monster carries her away to a far-off land where she lives out the rest of her life in peace. Though she was indeed a witch, she did not kill the farm girl or the king, who actually died of old age. The prince had murdered the farm girl himself in order to inspire his people to back him into overthrowing the queen. After the queen was taken to safety by the Monster, the prince continued to rule the kingdom in the grandfather's place.
An apothecary follows old traditions and beliefs, using herbs and brews to cure ailments. His business becomes less popular as a local parson tells his congregation not to accept the apothecary's old ways and denying the apothecary use of an old Yew tree. When the parson's two daughters become sick, the parson asks the apothecary to save their lives after all other resources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who has turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best source of healing ingredients, the parson promises to give him the tree and deliver the parishioners to him as customers. Yet the apothecary says that he cannot help, and the girls die. The Monster awakens from the yew tree to destroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment.
While the apothecary was a greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved lives, including the girls', if the parson had allowed him his way of life. The parson was a man of belief but was willing to discard his beliefs when they were in the way. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary require belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was unable to treat the two girls. Belief is half the cure.
A man was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned the Monster to ensure people would notice him. Though people now notice him, the man finds himself more alone than before.
Connor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story. His mother has been pulled to the edge of a cliff by a sudden collapse of the ground, and Connor must hold her hand to save her from falling. Eventually, his grip fails and his mother falls. The Monster forces Connor to confess the truth: Connor loosened his grip on purpose. While he could have held on longer, he let go in order to stop the pain of having to hold on.
Through the Monster, Connor ultimately understands that although he does not want his mother to die, it is something he must accept, and he must not feel guilty for wanting it to be over so he does not have to feel pain anymore. After this, Connor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother one last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother, with whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Connor the room that used to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster."
Rings,"On an airplane bound for Seattle, a man reveals that he has watched Samara Morgan's cursed videotape. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too, and asks the man if he made a copy. After learning he did not, Samara causes the airplane to crash.
Two years later, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a VCR, discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he falls out of contact. She is inspired to find him when a panicked girl, Skye, contacts her, asking for Holt's whereabouts. Julia meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group film themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person, called a ""tail"".
Julia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has twelve hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Holt's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must cremate Samara's physical remains.
Gabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains.[N 1] He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is Braille, translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a potter's field outside town.
Heading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling utility pole. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.
Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of cicadas fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara removes Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara’s corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.
While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes viral, despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be ""rebirth"", as Samara is successfully reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own."
Underworld: Blood Wars,"The remaining vampire covens are on the verge of being wiped out by the Lycans. Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seeking justice for the deaths of Viktor and Marcus, and the Lycans, led by Marius, intending to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids.
Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, says she wants Selene to be granted clemency so that she can train the Eastern Coven's neophyte Death Dealers. To that end, Semira enlists Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council. Thomas succeeds and Selene arrives at the Eastern Coven with David. Semira has her ally and lover Varga poison Selene, then slaughter the Death Dealers and blame Selene for it. Once Selene is under arrest, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to gain Selene's power. Thomas and David try to rescue Selene, but they're attacked by Semira and Varga. They kill Thomas, but not before he's able to hold them off long enough for David and Selene to escape.
The pair seeks refuge with the Nordic Coven. They are pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. Selene and David arrive at Var Dohr, the stronghold of the Nordic Coven. Their Elder Vidar reveals that David was the son of the High Elder Amelia, making him the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven.
Alexia, who is secretly Marius's lover, tells Marius that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and the Lycans attack the Nordic Coven. The Nordic vampires, led by Vidar's daughter Lena, fight alongside Selene and David. Selene engages in single combat with Marius, who demands to know Eve’s location. Selene insists she does not know the location, which Alexia confirms after tasting some of Selene's blood. Marius sounds the retreat for his troops and Selene, wishing to pass on to the sacred world, slides herself under the now-broken ice of the lake.
Upon Alexia's return to the Eastern Coven's castle, she informs Semira of the events at the Nordic Coven. Semira kills her, revealing she knew of Alexia's treachery, and wanted Alexia to lead the Lycans to the Nordic Coven for her own ends. David returns to the Eastern Coven and presents himself as its rightful heir. Semira is arrested by none other than Varga, whose ultimate loyalty is to the rightful leadership of the coven. She is subsequently imprisoned in the dungeons.
The coven comes under attack by Marius and his forces. The Lycans blow holes in the castle's walls, letting in sunlight, killing some vampires. David continues fighting, only to find himself face to face with Marius. Selene suddenly reappears, in a Nordic appearance and coat over her normal Death Dealer uniform. It is revealed that the Nordic Coven revived her through their passing to sacred world ritual and in doing so new abilities like enhanced speed are enabled. She swiftly begins dispatching the Lycans, as the rest of the Nordic Coven, led by Lena, join the fight.
While Selene is making her way through the castle, the guards in the dungeons are killed by Semira, who then escapes from her cell. Selene and David find Marius, but David is waylaid by Semira. As Marius and Selene's fight continues, a drop of Marius's blood lands on Selene's lips. She is suddenly flooded by a series of blood memories in which Marius finds Michael. She sees Marius capturing Michael and slitting his throat in order to collect his blood and consume it. Believing that Michael is dead, she bites her own wrist, using her own blood memories of the time she has spent with Michael, Eve, and David. Although Marius has transformed, Selene rips out his spine, killing him instantly. Semira drank Selene's blood that she collected earlier and gained immunity to sunlight, but David manages to kill her while she was distracted with glee from the sunlight falling on her. He shows Marius's severed head to the Lycans, and forcefully tells them to retreat.
In the aftermath, Selene, David, and Lena are chosen as the new Elders. It is revealed that after being resurrected at the Nordic Coven, Selene was reunited with Eve, who has been following her mother through their telepathic link."
Monster Trucks,"Terravex Oil is in the midst of a fracking operation near a lake in North Dakota, overseen by CEO Reece Tenneson and geologist Jim Dowd. The operation releases three subterranean creatures and destroys the drilling rig. Two are captured by Terravex, but one of them escapes the site. Meanwhile, high school senior Tripp Coley is looking for something to do to escape the life of his family; his parents are divorced, his mother Cindy is in a relationship with Rick the town's sheriff, who fails to take him seriously, and has taken up a part-time job at a local junkyard, where he builds a pickup truck in hopes of being able to leave his town. One night, Tripp encounters the escaped creature in the junkyard and captures it, but the creature escapes before he can seek authorities.
The next day Tripp, along with classmate Meredith, finds the creature has a diet of oil and it takes shelter within the hood of his truck. He quickly befriends him, names him Creech, and promises to help him get home. Tripp modifies the truck to give Creech more control over the truck as a makeshift engine, and Meredith becomes quite impressed and surprised at Creech's speed and talent. Meanwhile, Tenneson is still concerned about the incident at the drilling rig that exposed Creech, since similar experiments have revealed the other two creatures. He decides to protect the company's image by drilling poison into a hole leading to the underwater tunnels, and by sending hired mercenary Burke to kill their captured creatures, to the objection of Jim, as he finds the monsters have significant intelligence and emotions. Tripp and Meredith go see Tripp's father Wade to seek help.
However, when Tripp goes to check on Wade, he realizes he sold him out to Burke, and Tripp and Meredith escape in the truck with Creech, but not before destroying Wade's trailer. Tripp, Meredith and Creech are chased by Burke and his team and Rick. Tripp, Meredith and Creech manage to escape by jumping over a train, and camp at a hunting cabin owned by Meredith's father near the lake, while Rick chastises Burke for attempting to follow them himself.
When Creech gets the sense something bad will happen to the other creatures, he heads to the Terravex headquarters where the other creatures are being held captive. Tripp and Meredith follow Creech using Meredith's cellphone, as Trip left his phone in the truck. When they arrive, they find Creech's parents, but are attacked by Terravex workers. Creech arrives and is captured; Tripp and Meredith are taken to Tenneson, and he tells them to forget about Creech and his parents and has Burke escort them out.
Sympathetic to the creatures' plight, Jim decides to help Tripp and Meredith rescue the creatures. With the help of Tripp's junkyard boss, Mr. Weathers, they acquire two more trucks, one being a repossession from a rich teen who had failed to make payments, and another being the birthday present of his friend Sam Geldon, whose father owns a local car dealership. They modify the trucks for Creech's parents to control similar to Creech in Tripp's truck. Jim helps the group by stealing the Terravex truck on which the monsters, Creech's parents, are loaded on. At the dealership, the creatures take control of the modified trucks and the group make their escape up the mountain leading to the tunnels.
Terravex gives chase up the mountain and the group escape by using the trucks to jump over the edge of the mountain. On the way, Rick helps Tripp and the group escape from Burke. After realizing the poison has been inserted, Tripp gets into a head-on battle with Burke, who attempts to push him into the drilling hole, but ends when Tripp and Creech overturn Burke's truck, destroying the poison machine and killing Burke when his truck is thrown into the equipment, only for Tripp to fall into the hole. Creech saves him from drowning before he and his parents depart back home and Terravex is exposed by the group for the experimentation that was harming the creatures' habitat. Tenneson is arrested, Tripp and Rick develop on good terms and together build a new engine for the truck, and Tripp and Meredith begin a relationship."
The Bye Bye Man,"In 1969, a mass murder occurs in which a man kills people on his block. As he shoots the neighbors, he continuously asks if anyone spoke about ""the name"" which cannot be said. He also repeats the same thing over and over: ""Don't say it, don't think it; don't think it, don't say it.""
In present day, Elliot, his girlfriend Sasha, and best friend John move into an off-campus house not far from their college. Soon, mysterious things start to happen, such as Sasha developing a strange cough and Elliot finding coins in a nightstand that continually reappear. Elliot also finds writing consisting of ""don't think it, don't say it"", and a name: the Bye Bye Man. During a seance involving their friend Kim, the name is mentioned.
Sasha continues to become sick as Elliot and John start experiencing hallucinations and stranger activity. Elliot begins to suspect that Sasha is cheating on him with John. Elliot's brother Virgil also becomes suspicious. Kim is killed after she is struck by a train. Elliot is taken in for questioning by Detective Shaw, and is released when Kim's suicide note reveals she killed her roommate and was planning on killing Elliot, Sasha, and John.
The librarian shows Elliot a dossier about the Bye Bye Man; a teenager killed his family and told a reporter that the Bye Bye Man made him do it. The same reporter later became the mass shooter during the '60s, who killed himself after realizing people knew about the Bye Bye Man. Elliot also visits the widow of the reporter, who reveals that the curse causes insanity, hallucinations, and eventually death. Signs of his coming are coins mysteriously appearing, sounds of a train, and a large, skinless hound. The only way to prevent it is to not think of his name or speak of him. If someone already knows, they must be killed. The librarian is hit by Elliot's car by accident, after she killed everyone in her home, coming for Elliot next.
Sasha and John are also suffering from the hallucinations. Elliot finds John stabbing Sasha. He shoots John, but after he picks up the corpse, it is revealed to have been Sasha that was stabbing John; therefore, Elliot killed Sasha. The Bye Bye Man appears and gives Elliot a hallucination. Elliot keeps Virgil and his daughter Alice away long enough for him to shoot himself with a gun. Virgil and Alice get away before the entire house goes up in flames.
While riding home, Alice reveals she found the coins from the nightstand near the trash, along with the writing. However, she could not read it due to her poor night vision. Detective Shaw arrives at the scene, where John is found to be alive but wounded. He struggles to whisper ""Bye... Bye..."" but the screen cuts to black before the sentence is finished."
Sleepless,"In Las Vegas, vice LVMPD policemen Vincent Downs and Sean Cass rob a shipment of cocaine belonging to entrepreneur Stanley Rubino, who intended to sell it to mobster Rob Novak, the son of a powerful mob boss. They volunteer to investigate the robbery in order to cover up their involvement, clashing with Internal Affairs investigators Jennifer Bryant and Doug Dennison, who are suspicious of their involvement. It is also revealed that Vincent is estranged from his wife Dena, who is getting remarried, and has minimal involvement in the life of his 16-year-old son Thomas.
While driving Thomas to his soccer game, Vincent is ambushed by Rubino's men, who stab him in the abdomen and kidnap his son, demanding the stolen cocaine back in exchange for Thomas's life. Vincent retrieves the cocaine from Cass, places it in a duffel bag and leaves it in the ventilation shaft of one of the bathrooms in Rubino's casino, hoping he can negotiate his son's release before handing over his leverage. He is unknowingly followed by Bryant, who, now convinced he his a dirty cop, retrieves it and hides it in the women's locker room nearby. Upon learning that the drugs were moved, Vincent is forced to present Rubino with bags of sugar to ensure Thomas's safety, but Novak uncovers his ruse and Thomas is recaptured by Rubino's men, while Vincent manages to escape. Meanwhile, after coming up empty while searching the casino for Downs, Dennison is convinced he's gotten away, and directs Bryant to go home and get some sleep. Bryant gives him the key to the women's locker with the cocaine, and heads for the exit.
Vincent infiltrates the casino in his police uniform, but crosses paths with Bryant on her way out and chased into one of the hotel rooms. They fight, and he subdues her before revealing he's been undercover on behalf of Internal Affairs for the last two years to dismantle the crime ring within the police department. He knows his partner Cass is a drug-runner, knew details about a previous investigation by Bryant, and is now attempting to find the senior member of law enforcement that is covering everything up. A skeptical Bryant directs him to the locker room to retrieve the cocaine, but the drugs have recently been removed by Dennison. Dennison ambushes Vincent, but is ultimately overpowered and knocked unconscious. Meanwhile, Thomas escapes and steals Rubino's cellphone to contact Vincent, but is quietly being followed by Rubino and his men who allow it all to happen in an attempt to lure Vincent into a trap. Elsewhere, Dena finds out Vincent and Thomas are in danger and heads to the casino.
Cass arrives and confronts Vincent about his Internal Affairs involvement, but then saves Vincent from one of Novak's men. He is shot in the process and presumed dead. Going through Cass' phone, Vincent finds out Dennison is the mole in the force, is on Novak's payroll, and informed Cass that Vincent was Internal Affairs and needed to be killed. Bryant and Dennison later find a severely injured Cass in the garage. While Bryant checks the vitals of Novak's man, Dennison privately questions Cass on whether Vincent is aware of his involvement and finishes him off when Cass refuses to answer. Vincent and Thomas reunite just as Novak begins shooting up the casino and escape to the parking garage. Meanwhile, Bryant arrests Rubino.
Vincent and Thomas attempt to escape in a stolen car, but are ambushed by Novak and his men, leading to a violent shootout. Dena arrives and kills one of Novak's men before Novak corners them. He shoots Vincent in the chest, but Vincent survives and fatally shoots Novak. Vincent then contacts Bryant and alerts her of Dennison's corruption. Realizing he's been exposed, Dennison draws his gun, and shoots Bryant and Rubino and forces the police cruiser they're in to crash.
Dennison crawls out of the wreckage claiming Rubino killed Bryant and the driver with a stolen gun before being shot by Dennison, but Bryant has managed to survive and exposes Dennison, who is arrested by the arriving policemen. Vincent and Bryant are taken to the same hospital, where they make amends and congratulate each other on the job. Meanwhile, a corrupt DEA Agent, seen earlier in the film, contacts Novak's father and informs him there's been a problem."

Split,"Casey Cooke is an emotionally withdrawn teenager, having been molested as a child by her uncle John, who became her legal guardian after her father's death. While hanging out with her classmates, Claire and Marcia, the three are kidnapped by Kevin Wendell Crumb, a man suffering from dissociative identity disorder. Kevin has been evaluated by psychologist Dr. Karen Fletcher, who discovered that he formed multiple personalities as a means to cope with the abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother. While Kevin appears otherwise stable, Dr. Fletcher has identified 23 distinct personalities within Kevin; in his mind, these personalities sit in chairs in a room, waiting for their turn ""in the light"" (controlling Kevin's body) as directed by ""Barry"", the dominant personality. She has also found that Kevin's physiology changes when a new personality comes into the light. Recently, ""Barry"" has refused to allow ""Dennis"" or ""Patricia"" their turns, in part due to Dennis' tendencies towards bothering underage girls and Patricia's undesirable traits, and also because both appear to worship ""The Beast"", a yet-unseen 24th personality. Regardless of which personality is controlling Kevin, Dr. Fletcher can call forth Kevin's own personality by speaking his full name to him.
Kevin takes the girls to his underground quarters and secures them in a cell. They recognize his dissociative disorder, and Claire attempts to use this against Kevin to escape but is caught by ""Dennis"" and segregated from the others. Over several days, Kevin leaves them locked up while he goes off to work and attends appointments with Dr. Fletcher. During these meetings, Dr. Fletcher recognizes that ""Dennis"" has seemingly taken over the dominant personality from ""Barry"", though he tries to act as ""Barry"" to fool her. She recalls an incident that ""Barry"" told her about a month before, where two teenage girls had walked up to him, taken his hands and placed them on their breasts, which may have triggered ""Dennis"" to take over. Dr. Fletcher suspects that Kevin, as ""Dennis"", is responsible for the three missing teenagers.
During this time, Marcia also attempts to escape but is caught by ""Patricia"" and segregated. Casey befriends ""Hedwig"", a young boy personality of Kevin's; it is later revealed that ""Hedwig"" has complete control over ""the light"", and has provided ""Dennis"" and ""Patricia"" with control. She gets ""Hedwig"" to let her out of her cell to see his bedroom, believing that there may be a means of escape through ""Hedwig's"" window but finds that it is only a drawing of a window. She is able to convince ""Hedwig"" to give her a walkie-talkie. She uses it to call for help, but the person at the other end of the walkie doesn't believe her, thinking that someone is playing a joke. Before she can convince the person that she is serious, ""Patricia"" takes over Kevin's body and subdues Casey.
Dr. Fletcher shows up at Kevin's home, where he reveals that ""The Beast"" is real and that he has met him. Suspicious of ""Dennis"", Dr. Fletcher feigns needing the bathroom to look around his home, where she finds Claire in her cell, but before she can do anything, ""Dennis"" catches her, sprays her face with a sedative in an aerosol can, and secures her in a separate room. He then leaves. While out, ""The Beast"" personality takes over for the first time, giving Kevin super-human abilities, while Claire and Marcia attempt to escape from their cells. Dr. Fletcher regains consciousness long enough to write out Kevin's full name on a piece of paper before ""The Beast"" returns and kills her. Casey escapes from her cell, only to find that ""The Beast"" has already attacked and eaten Marcia and watches in horror as he does the same to Claire.
Casey finds Dr. Fletcher's body and her note on the piece of paper. ""The Beast"" approaches her, but she calls out Kevin's full name, bringing Kevin forth. Upon learning of the situation and realizing that he hasn't been in control of his body for two years, Kevin instructs Casey to kill him with his shotgun. Following this statement, all 24 personalities begin warring for control of ""the light"", but shortly thereafter ""The Beast"" personality takes hold again. Casey escapes from his quarters into an underground tunnel and shoots him twice, but the shells have little effect. She locks herself in a small caged area. ""The Beast"" finds her and is about to pull the bars open to attack her but sees faded scars across her body, a sign of her past emotional turmoil and self-harm. Having previously declared his plans to rid the world of the ""untouched"", those whose hearts are impure because they have never suffered in their lives, he considers Casey to be ""pure"" and spares her, disappearing from the tunnels.
Sometime later, Casey is rescued and learns that she was being held at the Philadelphia Zoo, where Kevin had been an employee. Casey is asked by a police officer if she is ready to return home with her uncle. She hesitates to answer. In another hideout, ""Dennis"", ""Patricia"", and ""Hedwig"" exert collective control over Kevin's body and admire the power of ""The Beast"" and their plans to change the world.
In a diner, several patrons watch the news as a reporter states that Kevin's personalities have earned him the nickname ""The Horde"". A female patron notes the similarity between Kevin and a wheelchair-using criminal who was incarcerated 15 years earlier. As she tries to remember the nickname he was given, the man sitting next to her tells her that it was ""Mr. Glass""."
xXx: Return of Xander Cage,"NSA Agent Augustus Gibbons attempts to recruit footballer Neymar Jr. for the xXx program when a satellite crashes in Brazil, apparently killing them both. Shortly afterwards, a team of four skilled individuals led by Xiang infiltrate a highly guarded CIA office in New York City and retrieve ""Pandora's Box"", a device which is capable of controlling satellites to crash at specific locations as warheads. CIA Agent Jane Marke tracks down former xXx operative Xander Cage, who faked his death and has been living in self-imposed exile in the Dominican Republic, and convinces him to return to active service to retrieve the device.
In London, after enlisting an old friend, Ainsley, for help, Cage tracks down the attackers to the Philippines. At an RAF outpost in Lakenheath, a unit of Special Forces operatives led by Paul Donovan is assigned to help Xander, but he rejects them in favour of his own team, composed of sharpshooter Adele Wolff, DJ Harvard ""Nicks"" Zhou, and getaway driver Tennyson ""The Torch."" They are also aided by introverted weapons specialist Becky Clearidge. The team locates Xiang and his teammates Serena, Talon and Hawk, and Cage meets Xiang in an underground nightclub on a remote island, where Xiang reveals that his team are also xXx agents, recruited by Gibbons. He claims to have stolen Pandora's Box to prevent its misuse, although Serena believes they should destroy it.
Shortly after, Russian soldiers raid the island. The group manages to fend off the attackers, while Xiang manages to escape with Pandora's Box. Xander intercepts Xiang and chases him to a nearby beach. Serena betrays him, destroys the Box and joins Xander's team, while Xiang escapes and regroups with Talon and Hawk. After another satellite crash in the Olympic Stadium in Moscow, Marke determines that the device that Serena destroyed was only a prototype, and that both teams have been wasting time, while Cage determines that CIA Director Anderson is involved in the conspiracy and that the actual Pandora's Box is in his hands.
Cage's and Xiang's teams race to reach Anderson first in Detroit, tracking the unique signal of Pandora's Box, with Xander and Xiang fighting and later protecting each other from Anderson's men. Xander confronts Anderson, who admits to causing the satellite crash that killed Gibbons. Anderson is then shot dead by Wolff. Cage reluctantly allows the CIA to arrest Xiang in an attempt to frame him for the Moscow attack, and they secure the box. En route back to headquarters, Marke announces that the xXx Program has been shut down and shoots Xander in order to keep it for herself. She then sends a group of assassins to eliminate the others, who are awaiting extraction at a local NSA warehouse. They join forces to fend off their attackers and receive assistance from another former xXx operative, Darius Stone.
Xander survives due to a bulletproof vest Becky had given him earlier and joins forces with Xiang to fight Donovan and his men, while Marke uses the box to send a satellite plummeting towards the warehouse where the teams are fighting. Xander ejects Donovan from the plane, while Xiang sends Marke falling to her death and then parachutes out with the box in hand. Despite Becky's attempts to halt the signal, they cannot stop the satellite from crashing. In a last attempt to protect them, Xander crashes the plane into the approaching satellite before it reaches the warehouse and jumps out, using the cargo load to safely reach the ground. Xiang gives Cage the device, and Xander decides to destroy it. The team attends Gibbons' funeral, where Xander is approached by Gibbons himself, who faked his death and is now rebuilding the xXx Program on his own, starting with Neymar as the newest recruit. Gibbons compliments Xander on a job well done and Xander decides to continue in service, ready for a new mission to watch the watchers and preserve liberty."

A Dog's Purpose,"In the 1950s, a feral puppy named Toby is whisked away to the dog pound and quickly euthanized, wondering if ""fun"" truly is life's purpose.
His strong spirit is reborn and reincarnated as a newborn Retriever puppy in 1961. Toby leaves his cage at a puppy mill and is found by two garbage men who plan to sell him for their own profit. They leave to drink and Toby is spotted locked inside their pick-up truck by a young boy named Ethan and his mother, who rescue him from the brink of death by heatstroke. After they convince Ethan's father, the dog is allowed to stay and renamed Bailey.
Bailey and Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer when the family visits Ethan's maternal grandparents' farm, and Bailey now believes Ethan alone is his purpose. Years pass and after several attempts at advancing in his job failed, Ethan's father has become a deadbeat alcoholic, though teenage Ethan still tries to respect him – inviting him to a football game now that he has been named starting quarterback.
Over the summer, Ethan goes to a fair with Bailey and meets Hannah, who he quickly begins dating, with Bailey referring to her as ""part of the pack"". Ethan and Hannah spend their summer happy together though their senior years are upcoming, but they plan to go to the same school; popular Ethan getting a football scholarship and Hannah following him on an academic one. When he goes home one night though, Ethan's father is drunk and shouting at Ethan's mother. He turns on Ethan then and when his mother tries to keep them separated, he shoves her to the ground. Ethan orders his father to leave and never come back, and becomes ""the leader of the pack"".
Later, at a game watched by scouts, Ethan is offered a full 4-year scholarship to Michigan State, but that night a vindictive classmate named Todd throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's house as a prank, which unintentionally results in a house fire. Bailey alerts Ethan, who goes to save his mother. Unable to get out of the door, they head out through his mother's bedroom window upstair. Ethan first lowers her with her sheets to the neighbors below, then Bailey, however he drops his rope and is left with no other way to exit but to jump. But when Ethan jumps out of the window, Ethan badly fractures his leg, ending his dreams of an athletic scholarship. Bailey attacks Todd, who is apprehended and arrested by the police when firecrackers fall out of his pocket. Now, Ethan must go to an agricultural school where he will learn to take over his grandparents' farm. Falling into depression, self-pity and bitterness, Ethan grudgingly breaks off his romance with Hannah before leaving for college. Sometime afterwards, an aged Bailey slowly expires at the veterinarian's office after sharing an eleventh-hour teary goodbye with Ethan.
Bailey reincarnates into another dog life, a female German Shepherd police dog named Ellie, sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s, while possessing full memories and experiences of his past lives. Ellie is partnered with a widowed officer named Carlos from the Chicago Police Department, and works hard at ""seeking"" and ""finding"", now seeing the job as life's purpose. The two form a close relationship which ends after Ellie jumps into a rushing river and saves a kidnapped girl from drowning, and is then fatally shot during a struggle with the armed kidnapper who was a moment away from killing an unsuspecting Carlos.
Reborn again in the mid-1980s as a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, he forms a bond with an Atlanta college student named Maya who names him Tino. Maya is lonely, which Tino, having bonded closely with the girl, realizes, and makes his purpose to find her some happiness. She starts a relationship with another classmate named Al who she begins seeing after Tino falls for Al's dog, a black and white Landseer named Roxie, and allows her to open up to him. Maya and Al marry and have 3 children who all love the Corgi. In love with Roxie (though she does not seem to reciprocate the romance), Tino is permanently heartbroken when one day she does not return from the vet. As he lies dying of old age in the late 1990s, Tino thanks Maya for giving him one of his best lives.
Bailey is again reborn and reincarnated, this time, as a St. Bernard-Australian Shepherd mix, sometime during the next decade, only to be taken in by an abusive and neglectful urban couple who name him Waffles. Waffles is eventually dumped in an abandoned lot and reluctantly sets off in search of a new life. Walking past a dog park and remembering how long it had been since he played, Waffles meets a dog and her human who hold a familiar scent to him, though he knows neither of them. He gradually makes his way to the country area where he spent summers as Bailey without even realizing at first where he is headed. He joyfully reunites with his old master Ethan, who is now somewhere in his 50s, living a lonely life and apparently broken in spirit at his grandparents' old farm, which he now owns and runs. Ethan, of course, initially has no idea who this wandering dog really is and hands him over to the local animal shelter. But he soon has a change of heart and reclaims him, naming him Buddy. Buddy, sensing that he has finally found the true purpose of life that has long evaded him, finds a way to reunite Ethan with a widowed Hannah, and they eventually get married.
Buddy finally convinces Ethan that he is his beloved childhood pet by performing some tricks and responding to key phrases that were known only to the two of them all those many, many long years ago. The dog in voiceover tells the viewer that life is about having fun; saving others; not getting caught in the past or regrets; finding someone to be with; and living for today."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,"Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus discovered the T-virus. Unfortunately, the virus had the side effect of sudden and uncontrollable mutation; in Cape Town, South Africa, a boy dies in a cable car ascending to Table Mountain, then reanimates and kills the other passengers. Marcus tried to have the program shut down, despite protests from his colleague Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen). When Marcus refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker to kill him. The Red Queen is then created using childhood images of Marcus' daughter.
Some time after the events of the previous film, Alice awakens in the now-ruined White House after being betrayed once again by Wesker. While she is searching for survivors, the Red Queen appears and tells Alice she must return to the Hive, over 400 miles west on I-64 in Raccoon City, within 48 hours. The Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which can kill every organism infected by the T-virus (which may or may not include Alice), and is just waiting for the remaining few thousand humans to be wiped out. When asked why she is betraying her creators, the Red Queen says that she will explain once Alice arrives at the Hive.
On her way to Raccoon City, Alice is captured by Isaacs — learning the one she previously killed was just a clone — though she manages to escape his convoy. Alice later arrives in Raccoon City and is ambushed by a group of survivors, consisting of Doc, Abigail, Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Alice's friend Claire Redfield, who survived the attack on Arcadia. With Isaacs' convoy approaching, trailed by a horde of zombies, the group prepares for battle. They defeat the convoy, retrieve Isaacs' few human captives and burn the horde, though Cobalt is killed. With more undead on the way and no defenses left, Alice and crew head for the Hive entrance, located at the bottom of the crater from the nuclear bomb dropped on the city. Wesker, having taken control of the Hive, releases mutated guard dogs, killing Christian and a freed captive.
Inside the Hive, the Red Queen appears to Alice and explains her reason for betraying Umbrella. She reveals that a video was uploaded to her program which contained the recording of Isaacs explaining to Umbrella's executives the plan to release the T-virus, cleansing the world of man-made catastrophes while saving the rich and powerful in cryogenic capsules hidden in the Hive, and later rebuild the world in their image. The Red Queen program is in conflict, as she can never hurt an Umbrella employee but also must value remaining human life, which is why she enlists Alice's help in order to stop Isaacs. Before proceeding onwards, Alice is silently warned by The Red Queen that someone in her group is a spy for Umbrella.
Navigating the Hive, the group encounter several traps, resulting in the deaths of Abigail and Razor along with the remaining freed captive. Alice and Doc plant bombs throughout the Hive taken from the leftover equipment of the original team to investigate the Hive. Alice confronts the real (tech-upgraded) Isaacs, whereupon she is held at gunpoint by Doc — Umbrella's spy — while Claire is captured by Wesker. A cryogenic capsule opens, releasing Alicia Marcus, Umbrella's co-leader and Marcus' daughter. Isaacs reveals to Alice that she is actually a clone of Alicia, before going on to explain his plan in eliminating the pair so that he can assume full control of Umbrella. Though Issacs is the co-founder of Umbrella, Alicia points out that Wesker is merely an employee and proceeds to ""fire"" him, allowing the Red Queen to crush his legs with a security door. Doc tries to shoot Alice, but he finds his gun empty — as Alice had earlier deduced his treachery — and Claire executes him. After giving Wesker the deadman's switch to the bombs she planted, Alice and Claire pursue Isaacs while Alicia willingly stays behind to review her childhood memories with her father.
Upon catching up to Isaacs, Alice and Claire fight him as the trio are lifted back up to the Hive. Isaacs overpowers Claire and attacks Alice in the Laser Corridor. Alice manages to dodge the lasers before re-engaging Isaacs, eventually beating him when she secretly activates a grenade in his pocket. She escapes to the surface with the anti-virus, but Isaacs reboots and follows; he catches her just as she's about to release the antivirus. Before he can kill Alice, however, Isaacs is confronted and instantly killed by his clone, which Alice encountered en route to Raccoon City; the clone is then devoured by the undead. The distraction allows Alice to release the antivirus, killing all of the undead around her before she passes out. Wesker simultaneously drops the deadman's switch, destroying the Hive along with the hibernating Umbrella elite; Alicia and Wesker are killed in the process.
Claire wakes Alice, who survived because the antivirus killed only the T-virus within her body, not the healthy cells. The Red Queen gives Alice an upload of all of Alicia's memories, granting her a childhood. Alice travels into Manhattan, saying that the antivirus, carried only by the winds, will take years to reach all corners of the globe. Until then, says Alice, her mission is not finished."

Julia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has twelve hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Holt's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must cremate Samara's physical remains.
Gabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains.[N 1] He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is Braille, translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a potter's field outside town.
Heading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling utility pole. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.
Julia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of cicadas fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara removes Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara’s corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.
While Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes viral, despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be ""rebirth"", as Samara is successfully reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own."
The Space Between Us,"In the near future, Nathaniel Shepard, CEO of Genesis, launches the first ever mission to colonize Mars. During the journey, the lead astronaut, Sarah Elliot, discovers that she is pregnant. Shortly after landing, she dies from eclampsia while giving birth to the first human born on Mars. The father of the child is unknown. In a dilemma, Nathaniel eventually decides to keep the child on Mars as a secret, to avoid a PR disaster for his company and also keep the child safe.
Sixteen years later, Sarah's son, Gardner Elliot, has grown up into an inquisitive, highly intelligent boy who has only ever met 14 people in his very unconventional upbringing. One day, in order to find out more about his mother, he hacks into Centaur, a robot he helped build, to gain access to the ship's storage. There, he retrieves his mother's items. Among them are a wedding ring and a USB drive, from which he plays a video of her and a man in a beach house. Convinced that the man is his father, he becomes determined to find him.
Gardner logs on to an Internet chatroom, where he has struck up an online relationship with Tulsa, a street smart girl from Colorado who is constantly being shuffled from one foster home to the next. Under the guise of being confined to a penthouse due to osteogenesis imperfecta, they discuss their plans for the future. Gardner promises to come see her someday. He then watches the German language film, Wings of Desire, where an angel falls to Earth.
His mother figure, astronaut Kendra Wyndham, video calls Nathaniel and Genesis director Tom Chen to inform them of Gardner's extraordinary intelligence and to beg them to allow him to go to Earth. Nathaniel refuses, as Gardner would have to undergo a highly risky surgery to increase his bone density and then train to adapt to Earth's atmospheric pressure. Gardner undergoes the surgery anyway and after training, he, Kendra and some other astronauts board a space shuttle for Earth.
On the day of the space shuttle's arrival, Nathaniel discovers that Gardner is on board. He angrily confronts Tom, who hid this from him. Despite his anger, Nathaniel visits Gardner, who is being quarantined in NASA while undergoing medical tests to determine whether he is fit for life on Earth. After a visit from Kendra, Gardner manages to discover that he is not fit for life on Earth. Upset, he stages a daring escape and hitches a ride to find Tulsa. Upon seeing him, Tulsa hits him as she is upset at Gardner for 'ghosting' her for 7 months. However, she forgives him and he convinces her to help him find his father. They stop by her house to get supplies for the journey, but are found by Nathaniel and Kendra. While trying to convince him to return to NASA, Gardner angrily confronts Kendra with her own admission of not wanting children and escapes with Tulsa on an old plane which her foster father was working on. The plane abruptly loses oil pressure while still in the sky. Tulsa manages to crash-land the plane into an old, abandoned barn, causing a fiery explosion. They escape safely to a diner where they determine the location of the shaman who married Gardner's parents, Shaman Neka.
Believing that Gardner has died, a grieving Nathaniel and Kendra let out their rage at one another. After discovering that no bodies were found in the wreckage, they receive some devastating news - Gardner's body contains dangerously high levels of troponin, meaning that he has an enlarged heart. His heart is unable to stand Earth's atmospheric pressure and so Gardner must be returned to Mars immediately if he is to survive. The search is resumed with renewed fervor and they discover CCTV footage of Gardner and Tulsa in a supermarket parking lot, where they have bought clothes and supplies for the journey. During the journey, Gardner tells Tulsa the truth - that he was born and raised on Mars. Unwilling to accept the truth, she forces him out of the car but forgives him once he promises never to lie to her again, although she still does not believe him.
At night, they camp out under the stars, where they make love. In the morning, they are discovered by a follower of Shaman Neka and are brought to him. He agrees to help them. Gardner's nose starts bleeding, a fact he conceals while Tulsa accesses the records to get the location of the beach house, which is in Summerland, California.
Before they begin their journey, they make a detour to Las Vegas. Gardner's nose starts to bleed again and he collapses and is taken to a hospital. After seeing the carbon tubes in his bones on the results of an X-ray at the hospital, Tulsa tells Gardner she now believes he was born on Mars, but plans to leave him in the hospital, before foster care can come, as he is too sick to continue their journey. Gardner reveals that he knows he won't last on Earth anymore and all he wants is to meet his father before he dies. Tulsa gives in and helps him escape. They steal a car and drive to the beach house. There, they meet the man from the video, who reveals that he is not Sarah Elliot's husband, but her own brother. However, he thinks that the two are lying to him. Gardner runs down to the sea, where he tells Tulsa that this is where he wants to die. He collapses. Tulsa tries frantically to drag him to the shore, but he is too heavy for her. Nathaniel and Kendra arrive just in time to save him. After Nathaniel performs CPR on him, Gardner asks him about his mother Sarah and reveals that he knows that Nathaniel is his real father. Nathaniel, Kendra and Tulsa rush Gardner to a Dream Chaser. They plan to launch into the stratosphere to stabilize him. When that proves to not be enough, a desperate Nathaniel takes control and launches into outer space. Free of Earth's gravity, Gardner is revived.
Soon, Gardner boards a space shuttle to Mars. Tulsa and Gardner have an emotional parting. Kendra, who is staying on Earth because she is retiring from NASA, adopts Tulsa. Determined to join Gardner on Mars, Tulsa joins Kendra's training program. Back on Mars, with his father Nathaniel, Gardner is glad to be home."

The Lego Batman Movie,"Within the Lego Universe, Batman continues to protect Gotham City and fight crime. During his latest mission to stop Joker from destroying the city, he hurts his arch-rival's feelings by telling him he is not as important in his life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him. The following day, Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne, attends the city's winter gala, which is celebrating both the retirement of Commissioner Gordon and the ascension of his daughter Barbara as the city's new police commissioner, only to be infuriated by Barbara's plans to restructure the police to function without the need of Batman. Without warning, Joker crashes the party with the city's other villains, all of whom surrender, with the exception of Harley Quinn, who disappears during the confusion.
Suspecting his arch-rival is up to something, Batman plots to steal Superman's Phantom Zone Projector, a device that can banish anyone to the Phantom Zone which houses some of the most dangerous villains in the Lego multiverse. Just as he plans his heist of the device, Alfred intervenes and advises him to take charge of Dick Grayson, whom Bruce unwittingly adopted as his ward during the gala. Reluctantly agreeing to do so, Batman fosters Dick as Robin, whereupon the pair successfully recover the Projector from the Fortress of Solitude, and break into Arkham Asylum to send Joker to the Phantom Zone. Suspecting that the Joker wanted to be sent there, Barbara locks up Batman and Robin for their reckless actions.
While the Projector is being seized as evidence, Harley steals it back as part of Joker's plan and frees him, allowing him to return to Gotham with all the villains he had recruited in the Phantom Zone, including King Kong, the Gremlins, the Wicked Witch of the West, a Tyrannosaurus and a Velociraptor, Lord Voldemort, Sauron, the Jaws shark, the Daleks, Lord Vampyre, Agent Smith and his clones, and the Kraken. Realizing that the city does need him, Barbara releases Batman and Robin and teams up with them and Alfred to stop the Joker. Although Batman finds himself able to trust and rely on his new team upon reaching Wayne Island, he chooses to send them away rather than losing them like his parents. Upon facing him alone, Joker believes that Batman is incapable of change and zaps him to the Phantom Zone before stealing the Batcave's stash of confiscated bombs. Arriving in the Phantom Zone, Batman witnesses the harm his selfishness has caused to everyone and slowly accepts his greatest fear. Making a deal with the Zone's gatekeeper Phyllis, a talking Lego brick, to be allowed back to Gotham in order to retrieve the Zone's escaped prisoners, Batman arrives in time to save his teammates, apologizing to them for his actions, and requesting their help to stop Joker.
Realizing that Joker plans to use the explosives he took to destroy the city's Energy Facility, thus causing the city to come apart and be destroyed, Batman turns Barbara into Batgirl, before he, his team, and Gotham City's other villains, who felt neglected by Joker, manage to successfully send the escaped villains back to the Phantom Zone. However, the group fail to stop Joker's bombs going off as the explosion begins to tear the city apart at the plates beneath it. Knowing this was his fault, Batman reluctantly convinces Joker that he is the true reason for being the hero he is before they, their friends and allies, and the city's inhabitants, chain-link themselves together and pull the plates back together, saving the city.
With the city saved, Batman prepares to be taken back into the Phantom Zone to fulfill his bargain only to be rejected by Phyllis who chooses to let him remain after seeing how much he had changed in order to save everyone. Batman allows Joker and the rest of his rogues gallery to temporarily escape with the confidence that whenever they return, they will be no match for his new alliance with Robin, Batgirl, and Alfred."
Fifty Shades Darker,"After Anastasia Steele leaves Christian Grey, he has nightmares about his abusive childhood. Meanwhile, Ana begins a new job as an assistant to Jack Hyde, an editor at Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP) whose previous three assistants all quit within the last 18 months. Ana unexpectedly runs into Christian at the opening of her friend Jose Rodriguez's photography exhibit. She is dismayed that Christian bought all of Jose's portraits of Ana. Christian wants Ana back and agrees to her no rules, no punishments, and no more secrets terms.
As Jack and Ana head for an after-work drink, Ana is approached on the street by a young woman resembling her. Christian arrives at the bar and acts coolly towards Jack, then quickly departs with Ana. Ana dismisses Christian's warning about Jack's reputations. She is annoyed that Christian is considering buying Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP). Jack tells Ana he expects her to accompany him on a New York book expo trip, but after speaking with Christian, she agrees not to attend.
Shortly after, Ana again notices the same woman observing her and Christian from a distance. Christian deflects Ana's inquiry about the woman's identity, but later admits she is Leila Williams, a former submissive. After their contract ended, Leila wanted more, but Christian ended the relationship. Leila married a man who later died, causing Leila to have a mental breakdown. She has been stalking Ana and Christian.
Prior to the Grey family's annual charity ball, Christian takes Ana to Esclava, a beauty salon owned by Elena Lincoln. Elena is Christian's former dominant who introduced him to the BDSM lifestyle. Ana is furious that Christian took her there and that Elena and Christian are business partners. At the ball, Christian's sister mentions that her brother was expelled from four different schools for brawling. Christian tells Ana that his mother committed suicide; he was alone with her body for three days before being taken to the hospital where Grace Trevelyan Grey worked; she cared for and later adopted the young boy. During the ball, Ana rebuffs Elena's demand that she leave Christian and warns Elena to stay away. Arriving home, she and Christian discover Leila has vandalized Ana's car. Christian later tells Ana that his birth mother was a crack-addicted prostitute.
When Ana tells Jack she won't be attending the expo with him, he attempts to seduce her while they are alone at work, but she evades him and escapes. Christian exerts his influence to have Jack fired, and Ana is promoted to acting editor in Jack's place. Christian asks Ana to move in with him and she agrees.
At Ana's apartment, Leila threatens her with a gun. Christian and his driver/bodyguard, Jason Taylor, enter and Christian controls Leila by becoming her dominant. Ana, seeing Christian's need to be dominant, leaves, returning hours later. Christian is furious but Ana needs time to consider their relationship. Christian submissively drops to his knees and confesses that he is not a dominant, but a sadist who enjoyed hurting women who looked like his birth mother. He insists he wants to change. Christian later proposes but Ana needs time before accepting.
Christian leaves on a business trip, piloting his own helicopter. An engine failure occurs over Mt. St. Helens, forcing him to ditch the craft in a heavily forested area. A massive search and rescue ensues. As Ana and Christian's family await news, Christian arrives home safely. Ana, realizing she loves him, accepts his marriage proposal.
At Christian's birthday party, Elena accuses Ana of being a gold digger. Ana orders her to stop interfering. Christian overhears and dismissively tells Elena that she taught him, ""how to fuck"" while Ana taught him ""how to love."" Grace overhears the conversation and demands Elena leave for good; Christian also cuts all ties with Elena. Later that evening, Christian proposes to Ana, this time with a ring, and she accepts. As fireworks erupt in the sky, Jack Hyde watches the festivities from afar, silently swearing revenge against Christian and Ana."
John Wick: Chapter 2,"Four days after the events of the first film[6], former assassin John Wick finds his stolen 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1 at a chop shop owned by Abram Tarasov, brother of Viggo and uncle of Iosef. John dispatches Tarasov's men in a violent rampage that heavily damages the Mustang. He then spares Tarasov under the auspices of peace, and returns home.
After Aurelio takes John's Mustang for repairs, John is visited by Italian crime lord Santino D'Antonio. It is revealed that to complete his ""impossible task""—which allowed him to retire and marry Helen—John asked Santino for help. As a form of contract, Santino swore John to a ""Marker,"" an unbreakable promise symbolized by a ""blood oath"" medallion.[7] Santino presents the medallion to demand services from John, but John declines, claiming that he is retired. In retaliation, Santino destroys John's house with a grenade launcher.
Winston, the owner of the Continental hotel in New York City, reminds John that if he rejects the Marker, he will be violating one of the two unbreakable rules of the underworld: no killing on Continental grounds, and Markers must be honored. John accepts his commitment and meets with Santino, who tasks him with assassinating his sister Gianna, so he can claim her seat on the ""High Table,"" a council of high-level crime lords. Santino sends Ares, his mute personal bodyguard, to surveil John.
In Rome, John infiltrates Gianna's coronation party and confronts her. Faced with certain death, Gianna commits suicide by slitting her wrists. After she dies, John shoots her to make sure that she is dead, thereby fulfilling his commitment to Santino. John is then ambushed by Santino's henchmen, who intend to ""tie up loose ends"" by killing him. After killing most of the henchmen, John is pursued by Gianna's bodyguard, Cassian. Their battle is halted when they crash into the reception area of the Rome Continental, which—like the New York Continental—prohibits any ""business"" on its grounds. As the two share a tense drink, Cassian vows revenge for Gianna's death.
After John returns to New York City, Santino opens a $7 million contract for John's death under the guise of avenging his sister, leading numerous assassins to attack John. Cassian confronts John once again in the subway. John wins the battle, but leaves Cassian alive out of professional respect. Injured and desperate, John seeks help from an underground crime lord, the Bowery King, whose subordinates treat his injuries and guide him to Santino's location. John kills Santino's bodyguards and defeats Ares in a knife fight, but Santino is able to escape to the Continental. Santino smugly makes it clear that he intends to remain indefinitely in its sanctuary. Despite Winston's warnings, John shoots and kills Santino in the Continental lounge.
The next day, Winston sends for John and explains that, per the High Table, the contract on John has been doubled and offered globally. As a consequence of killing Santino on Continental grounds, Winston declares John ""excommunicado"" from the Continental, losing all access and privileges to the Continental's underworld resources. However, Winston delays announcing John's excommunication and global bounty by one hour to give him a head start, and provides him with a Marker for future use. Before leaving, John advises Winston to make it known that whoever tries to come after him will be killed. As John and his dog run through the park, dozens of cellphones around him ring, signaling that the global contract has been activated."
The Great Wall,"Searching for the secret of gunpowder, European mercenaries travel to China during the reign of the Renzong Emperor. A few miles north of the Great Wall, Khitan bandits attack them. Upon escaping, the survivors seek refuge in a cave but are attacked by a monster, leaving only William Garin and Pero Tovar alive. They cut off the monster's arm and bring it with them. The next day, they stumble upon the Wall and are taken prisoner by soldiers of the Nameless Order, led by General Shao and Strategist Wang.
The Nameless Order is a Chinese military order commissioned by the Imperial Court of the Song Dynasty to repel a horde of alien monsters called Tao Tieh. The monsters, one of whom William had slain, attack once every sixty years. The Order's commanders are stunned by the monster's severed hand, believing the invasion was still a week away. Suddenly, a large wave of monsters assault the Great Wall, and the Order is mobilized.
Both sides sustain heavy losses before the monsters' queen aborts the attack. During the battle, William and Tovar are freed by Ballard, a European who, like them, had ventured east twenty-five years ago in search of black powder, been detained, and now serves as an English and Latin teacher. William saves Peng Yong, a warrior, from the attacking monsters. William and Tovar's battle skills earn the Nameless Order's respect. William and Tovar meet with Ballard, plan to steal black powder, and flee while the Order is occupied in battle by the Tao Tieh.
During the night, two Tao Tieh reach the top of the Wall and kill several guards. Shao and Lin lead soldiers against them but are ambushed. The Tao Tieh are slain but Shao is killed, putting Lin in command of the Nameless Order. Around this time, an envoy from the capital Bianliang arrives with an ancient scroll which suggests that the monsters are pacified by magnets. Wang believes the stone William carries enabled him to slay the Tao Tieh he fought before entering the Wall. To test the hypothesis, William suggests they capture a Tao Tieh alive and agrees to help. This delays his escape plans, angering Tovar, who nevertheless postpones their plans to assist William over Ballard's protests.
During the next attack, the Tao Tieh are numerous enough to cause Lin to resort to using arrows equipped with black powder, whose capabilities had been kept secret from the Westerners until now. They capture a living Tao Tieh and prove the theory. The monster, however, is claimed and taken to the capital, Bianliang, by the Imperial envoy before it can be further studied. A short while later, a tunnel is discovered at the base of the Wall; the previous attacks had been a distraction, while the Tao Tieh dug a passage through the wall. While Lin investigates, Tovar and Ballard steal a supply of black powder and escape, knocking William unconscious after he tries to stop them.
William is arrested by the Chinese, and, though Peng Yong speaks up for him, is locked up in the Wall. Some distance away, Ballard betrays and abandons Tovar, but is captured by the Khitans, who accidentally kill themselves and Ballard after igniting the powder; the Chinese soldiers recapture Tovar. At the capital, the envoy presents the captive Tao Tieh to the Emperor, but it awakens and signals the Tao Tieh attack.
Rushing to protect the capital, Lin orders the use of hot-air balloons. Before setting out, Lin sets William free. Wang tells him to warn the outside world, but William boards the last balloon with Peng and Wang. They arrive just in time to save Lin from being devoured. They land in the Emperor's palace, where Wang proposes killing the queen by tying explosives to the captured Tao Tieh and giving it meat to be delivered. While transporting, a horde of Tao Tieh breach the sewers. Peng Yong sacrifices himself to save the others.
After releasing the Tao Tieh, Lin and William climb a tower for William to detonate the explosives via an arrow. Wang sacrifices himself to buy time for Lin and William to move to the upper floors. Two of William's arrows are deflected by the Tao Tieh queen's bodyguards, but William throws the magnet into the horde, creating a gap in the shields and allowing Lin's spear to get through. The queen is destroyed, and the rest of the horde is frozen solid. With the threat eliminated, William is allowed to return home and elects to take Tovar with him instead of the powder, much to Tovar's annoyance."
A Cure for Wellness,"At a large financial services firm in New York City, an ambitious young executive named Lockhart is sent by the company board of directors to retrieve Roland Pembroke, the company's CEO who had abruptly decided to stay at a ""wellness center"" in the Swiss Alps. The board needs Pembroke to sign off on an upcoming merger. The company is being investigated for criminal misconduct, and several self-serving partners hope to place all of the blame squarely upon Pembroke. Lockhart arrives at the spa, but he is met with resistance by the staff and Dr. Heinreich Volmer in attempting to speak with Pembroke.
Lockhart leaves but is involved in a car accident and supposedly awakens three days later at the center with his leg in a plaster cast. Curiously, in spite of the truly horrendous nature of the accident, both he and the driver suffer from no other injuries but a minor scratch or two. During his time at the spa, Lockhart meets a mysterious young girl named Hannah, who, among others, doses herself with a mysterious fluid kept in a small, cobalt-colored bottle.
A patient named Victoria Watkins, as well as residents of the nearby town, regale a fascinated Lockhart with the history of the spa. It was built on the ruins of a castle once owned by a baron roughly 200 years ago. The baron desired an heir of pure blood and married his sister. When the baron learned she was infertile, he began performing hellish experiments on the peasants in order to find a way to cure her infertility. He succeeded, but after finding the carelessly buried bodies of his victims, the peasants stormed the castle and set it on fire.
The baron's pregnant sister was captured by the peasants and the baby was cut from her womb before she was burned. Although the peasants tossed the baby into the local aquifer, it somehow survived. Lockhart attempts to escape the center but finds that no one is allowed to leave. After gifting Hannah a ballerina figurine, Lockhart bikes into town with her help. Lockhart leaves Hannah in a bar and seeks out a translator for Pembroke's German-language medical dossier.
He finds out that the people of the spa suffer from dehydration despite the quantities of water they imbibe from the aquifer. Meanwhile, Hannah, who has been kept at the spa her entire life, explores the bar and attracts the attention of the locals. Lockhart returns and gets into a fight with a man who was dancing with Hannah. He is rescued by Dr. Volmer, who has discovered that Lockhart had left the spa with Hannah. Everyone in the place is curiously cowed by Dr. Volmer.
Lockhart investigates his suspicions and discovers the transfusion wing of the spa is a front for macabre medical experiments. The water from the local aquifer possesses unique properties. It is very toxic to humans but has life restoring properties for the eels living in the water. The baron had devised a process to filter the water through the bodies of humans and distill it into a life giving essence. Volmer uses the patients as filters for this process.
This ""cure"" is ingested by Hannah, Volmer, and his staff in order to gain vastly lengthened lifespans. Lockhart also realizes that his leg isn't broken and that he is being forcefully kept prisoner there. Volmer then subjects Lockhart to nightmarish treatments that warp his mind until he believes he is insane. Hannah perceives this change and gives Lockhart back the ballerina that was given to Lockhart by his mother. This act helps to break him out of his delirium.
Around this time, Hannah has her first menstruation, and Volmer marries her. During the reception, he leads Hannah to a secret room built in the ruins of the castle and attempts to rape her. When Lockhart confronts Volmer he realizes that Volmer is the baron and Hannah is his daughter, the baby who was thrown into the well. They both had been aging very slowly due to the ""cure"". In the ensuing fight, Volmer's face is revealed to be a mask that hides his hideous burns. Lockhart sets Volmer and the castle on fire but is overpowered by Volmer all the same.
Hannah saves Lockhart by killing her father. He falls backwards into the aquifer and is eaten by the furiously voracious eels. Lockhart and Hannah escape from the premises on her bicycle as fire engulfs the structure. Not far down the road, Lockhart crashes into a car carrying his employers. They have arrived from New York to retrieve him and Pembroke. Lockhart is ordered into the car by the employers. They hope to make him the corporate scapegoat in lieu of the missing Pembroke. Lockhart instead chooses to ride away with Hannah while sporting a strange, wicked grin on his face."
Fist Fight,"It is the last day before summer vacation at Roosevelt High School in Atlanta, and the students are out of control, devising elaborate senior pranks and creating chaos. Andy Campbell, the school's mild-mannered and nerdy English teacher, and his fellow faculty members are trying to survive the chaotic day as best they can, but only the history teacher, Ron Strickland, is fierce enough to intimidate the students into behaving. Meanwhile, Campbell is awaiting news of the birth of his second child with his wife Maggie. While teaching, Campbell is pulled aside by his friend, the counselor Holly, to inform him of rumors of downsizing of all departments. Given his pregnant wife and child, this renders Campbell extremely anxious.
After preventing Campbell from walking into a paint trap, Strickland asks for his assistance in using an outdated AV system which keeps turning off after a couple of seconds. Campbell catches a student, Neil, secretly using a remote control app on his smartphone to turn off the VCR. An infuriated Strickland grabs the phone and destroys it. Neil, using a classmate's phone, turns the TV off again and it enrages Strickland, who grabs a fire axe and destroys the student's desk, sending the class screaming from the room. Both Campbell and Strickland are brought to Principal Tyler's office to discuss the matter. Strickland warns Campbell to keep his behavior a secret, but after Tyler threatens to fire them both if no one steps forward, Campbell tells the truth, resulting in the loss of Strickland's job. In retaliation, Strickland challenges Campbell to a fist fight after school. Campbell is convinced that he physically does not stand a chance against Strickland, and tries to set matters straight by asking Neil to share a false testimony to Principal Tyler in order to clear Strickland's name and have him reinstated. Neil agrees on the condition that Campbell buy him a MacBook Pro. After doing so, Campbell runs into Maggie and his daughter, Ally, who remind him to arrive promptly that afternoon for Ally's father-daughter talent show. Neil's false account is enough to convince Principal Tyler to reinstate Strickland.
Campbell and Strickland receive an emergency call from Molly. The two meet up with her in a mock United Nations debate room and discover she tricked them into coming there so they could talk through their issues, with Holly acting as mediator. When Campbell tells Strickland that he was able to get him his job back, Strickland is further enraged, stating that Campbell should have told him about this plan before acting, and citing the mishandling of the school system. The fight is still on.
Campbell tries to call 9-1-1 for help, but after telling the operator that he's a teacher and that another teacher wants to fight him, she hung up after laughing at the situation. After seeking the advice of Holly and Coach Crawford, Campbell resolves to have Strickland removed from the campus before the day's end. As a last resort, Campbell threatens Neil into giving him the drug MDMA. As Principal Tyler finds his Toyota Prius vandalized and parked in the school's lobby, Campbell plants the Molly in Strickland's satchel. Campbell calls the police in the hopes of having Strickland arrested, but the attempt is botched and both teachers are incarcerated. The two teachers share a cell with other inmates, and Campbell goes across the cell and tricks an enormous inmate into giving Strickland a beating, but only when signaled. Campbell then returns to Strickland in order to trick him into giving the signal, but Strickland instead tells Campbell that the fight is called off after everything that they have been through the day. When the inmate nonetheless attacks Strickland, Strickland easily knocks him out, and upon realizing Campbell's actions, declares the fight back on. The two are then released, after the police discover the drug used to frame Strickland was only aspirin.
Campbell heads back to the school to meet up with the school board, Tyler and Superintendent Johnson, but learns that his colleagues have all been fired. Impatient after being told to wait for nearly an hour, Campbell barges into the meeting and learns that he is one of the few to remain at his position. However, Campbell stands his ground and voices his complaints about the public school system not receiving the respect and materials it truly needs. Campbell heads over to Ally's talent show, where Ally's rendition of Big Sean's ""I Don't Fuck with You"" inspires him to take a stand against Strickland.
In the school parking lot, Campbell and Strickland confront each other, and engage in a heated fight that is dragged throughout the school and sees both men seemingly gaining the upper hand at different moments, and the fight goes throughout the entire school. Campbell briefly knocks Strickland out with a fire extinguisher and celebrates only to be sucker-punched by Strickland after he gets up. Strickland then answers Campbell's phone and learns that Maggie is about to give birth, at which point he decides to drive Campbell to the hospital.
That summer, Tyler arrives at the Campbell household to tell Campbell that the publicity and public outcry the fight generated has put the Department of Education in a position where they need to put more effort and money toward their schools, and must rehire Campbell and Strickland.

Get Out,"African-American photographer Chris Washington reluctantly agrees to meet the family of his white girlfriend Rose Armitage. During their drive to the family's countryside estate, they hit a deer and report the incident. The white policeman asks for Chris's identification even though he was not driving, but Rose intervenes and the incident goes unrecorded.
At the house, Rose's parents, neurosurgeon Dean and hypnotherapist Missy, and her brother Jeremy make discomfiting comments about black people. Chris witnesses strange behavior from the estate's black workers, housekeeper Georgina and groundskeeper Walter.
Unable to sleep, Chris goes outside to smoke and sees Walter sprinting through the grounds while Georgina prowls the house. Missy talks Chris into a hypnotherapy session, ostensibly to cure his smoking addiction. In a trance, he recounts the death of his mother in a hit-and-run when he was a child, about which he feels guilty, and sinks into a void Missy calls the ""sunken place"". He awakens believing he had a nightmare but realizes cigarettes now revolt him. Walter confirms that Chris was in Missy's office. Georgina unplugs his phone, draining his battery, though she claims it was an accident.
Dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together. They take an interest in Chris, admiring his physique or expressing admiration for black figures such as Tiger Woods. Jim Hudson, a blind art dealer, takes particular interest in Chris's photography skills. Chris meets another black man, Logan King, who acts strangely and is married to a much older white woman.
Chris calls his friend, black TSA Agent Rod Williams, about the hypnosis and the strange behavior at the house. Chris tries to inconspicuously photograph Logan with his phone to send to Rod, but his flash goes off; Logan becomes hysterical, yelling at Chris to ""get out"". The others restrain him and Dean claims Logan had an epileptic seizure. Away from the house, Chris persuades Rose that they should leave, while Dean holds an auction with a photo of Chris, which Jim Hudson wins. Chris sends the photo of Logan to Rod; Rod recognizes Logan as Andre Hayworth, who has been missing for months. Suspecting a conspiracy, Rod goes to the police, but they deride him.
While he packs to leave, Chris finds photos of Rose in prior relationships with black men, contradicting her claim that Chris is her first black boyfriend; the collection also includes pictures of Rose with Walter and Georgina. Chris is blocked from leaving the estate by the Armitage family, including Rose. He tries to attack Jeremy, but Missy hypnotizes him into unconsciousness. He awakens strapped to a chair in the basement. A video presentation featuring Rose's grandfather Roman explains that the family transplants the brains of white people into black bodies; the consciousness of the host remains in the ""sunken place"", watching but powerless. Hudson tells Chris he wants his body so he can gain Chris's sight and artistic talents.
Chris plugs his ears with cotton stuffing pulled from the chair, blocking the hypnosis. When Jeremy comes to collect him for the surgery, Chris bludgeons him with a croquet ball and impales Dean on the antlers of a deer mount. After fatally stabbing Missy and beating Jeremy to death, he drives away in Jeremy's car, but hits Georgina. Remembering his own mother's death, he carries Georgina into the car, but she is possessed by Rose's grandmother Marianne; she attacks him and he crashes, killing her. An armed Rose apprehends him with Walter, possessed by Roman. Chris awakens Walter with his phone flash. Walter takes Rose's rifle and shoots her and then himself. Rose, wounded, attempts to shoot Chris; Chris begins to strangle her but stops. Rod arrives in a TSA car and rescues Chris."
Rock Dog,"Bodi (Luke Wilson) is a young Tibetan Mastiff who is expected to be the next guard of the village of Snow Mountain, succeeding his father Khampa (J. K. Simmons) after the latter has driven out a pack of gangster grey wolves led by the villainous Linnux (Lewis Black) years ago, but is sure they will return. Khampa has some of the local sheep dressed up as Mastiffs to give the illusion the village is being guarded by multiple Mastiffs to keep the wolves at bay, but Bodi has trouble perfecting his father's signature move the Iron Paw which projects a powerful blast that as Khampa states can only happen if Bodi ""finds the fire."" Khampa has also forbidden music in the village since Bodi got distracted from his duties when he was younger.
After a disastrous training session, Bodi accidentally and indirectly causes a nearby flying plane to drop a package. Among the items that fell out, Bodi becomes interested in a red radio and listens to some of the music on the stations before becoming entranced on rock music and idolizes British rock legend Angus Scattergood (Eddie Izzard). Bodi steals a traditional dramyin from a den of locked up instruments, adds additional strings to make it a conventional Western guitar, and begins neglecting his guard duties in favor of playing music, which puts him at odds with his father, especially since Bodi told him that he has decided to be a musician.
After Khampa and some of the guard sheep accidentally cause Bodi to unleash a false alarm on the village while dressed as wolves (in an attempt to scare him straight) escalating into some fireworks being set off, the village elder Fleetwood Yak (Sam Elliott) convinces Khampa to let Bodi follow his dream and gives him a bus ticket to give to Bodi that will take him to a nearby city. Khampa gives Bodi the ticket, but makes him promise to give up music if his trip doesn't work out; the villagers and Fleetwood say goodbye to him after he leaves with his guitar. At the bus station, Bodi is discovered by two of Linnux's henchman, the short and comical Riff (Kenan Thompson) and the tall and silent Skozz. Riff informs Linnux of Bodi's departure and Linnux orders them to kidnap Bodi, reasoning that Bodi is his chance to take over Snow Mountain.
When Bodi makes to the city, he heads to Rock and Roll Park since it's where Scattergood began his career. He attempts to join a band consisting of the down-to-earth fox Darma (Mae Whitman) and an absent-minded goat drummer named Germur (Jorge Garcia), who are the only members and therefore don't have an audience. However, Bodi is humiliated after losing a guitar contest to an arrogant snow leopard guitarist named Trey (Matt Dillon), who is amused with Bodi's naivety. Trey, discovering his idolization for Scattergood, manipulates Bodi into convincing Scattergood to give him some guitar lessons at his mansion, though he knows a little secret about Angus' security set-up. At Scattergood's mansion, he is revealed to be a white Persian cat who wears black sunglasses all the time and has a serious case of songwriter's block as his manager, Ian, has given him three days to unleash a new song or his career will go down. His only companion is his robot butler Ozzie.
When Bodi tries to meet Scattergood, the latter is put off by Bodi's fanboy attitude and tries to evade him. Eventually, Bodi and Scattergood get lost in a back alley and Bodi decides to play music at Rock and Roll Park to get money for Scattergood to get back to his mansion. However, Riff and Skozz mistakenly kidnap Scattergood after they see Bodi at the park just when Bodi tries to convince a disbelieving Darma and Germur that he is with Scattergood. After Riff and Skozz realize their mistake, Linnux angrily sends them off to find Bodi again and they drop Scattergood off at his home. After Scattergood thinks that his career is over since he has less than a day to write a new song, he hears Bodi playing on his guitar and decides to use Bodi to create a new song. He invites Bodi into his home with the facade of a ""guitar lesson"" and together they create a new song called ""Glorious"".
Bodi later realizes that he was used after hearing Scattergood take full credit for the song on a radio, which saddens him. Trey mocks Bodi and everyone in the park leaves, although Darma and Germur feel sorry for Bodi. Soon afterward, Bodi finally gets captured by Linnux's henchmen via tranquilizer darts and he accidentally - while slightly under the tranquilizer's effects - reveals the fake Mastiff guards when Linnux interrogates him for information. Linnux and his gang head off to Snow Mountain while Bodi is put into a boxing match at Linnux's Fight Club, but Bodi cleverly has his opponent break the cage surrounding them so he can escape.
Meanwhile, Scattergood, after being guilt-tripped by Ozzie for exploiting Bodi for his own self-serving goals (Ozzie only needed to be recharged), uses his old tour bus to find Bodi. At Rock and Roll Park, Scattergood meets up with Darma and Germur and they discover that Bodi has been captured when they see his guitar covered in tranquilizer darts. Scattergood, with a change of heart, forgoes sending in his new song to rescue Bodi. After meeting with Bodi outside of Linnux's hideout, Scattergood makes amends with him by giving his old acoustic guitar with his autograph as a sign of gratitude and then takes him to Snow Mountain to stop Linnux and his henchmen.
Linnux and his gang overpower Khampa and the whole village and attempt to devour the villagers, but Bodi appears. After a climatic chase, Bodi subdues the wolves by ""finding the fire"" by playing Scattergood's guitar and making the wolves, the villagers, and his friends levitate. Khampa banishes Linnux with his Iron Paw and accepts Bodi's ambition to play rock music.
At the city, Scattergood gives full credit of the song ""Glorious"" to Bodi. Bodi forms a band with Darma and Germur as they (including Scattergood, Fleetwood, and the sheeps) sing and play ""Glorious"" to the city, the Snow Mountain villagers, Khampa, and most of the redeemed wolves (including Riff and Skozz) at Linnux's old Fight Palace. Outside, Trey tries to convince a bear bouncer that he's a part of the band, but is rejected. Scattergood recommends Bodi's band to Ian as Bodi shows the audience his blue energy wave."

The Girl with All the Gifts,"In the near future, humanity has been ravaged by a mysterious fungal disease (a mutation of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis). The afflicted are robbed of all free will and turned into fast, mindless flesh-eaters, referred to as 'hungries'. Humankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid, second generation children who crave living flesh but retain the ability to think and learn. The children are imprisoned, and go to ""school"" at an army base in the Home Counties, where they are experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell. Helen Justineau is responsible for educating and studying the children. Among the children is an exceptional girl named Melanie.
The base is overrun and the lab is breached. Melanie escapes the lab but outside the hungries are everywhere and soldiers are being swarmed and violently attacked in a failing, chaotic mass breach. Melanie wanders stunned by what she sees, but then violently attacks and infects two soldiers who are trying to restrain Helen. Helen and Melanie jump aboard an escaping armoured van.
The soldiers want to shoot Melanie, but Helen shields her and Caldwell insists she needs her. Melanie is muzzled and handcuffed to the gunner's chair atop the armoured vehicle and the group escapes into the wilderness. The van breaks down, the group proceed to London on foot. Caldwell reveals to Melanie that ""second generation"" hungries were discovered after newborns killed their infected mothers by burrowing out of the womb. When they try to leave the next day, they realize the hospital has been surrounded by a greater horde of hungries, and Melanie offers to lead the hungries away. She captures a small dog to use as bait to distract and lure the hungries away from the hospital so the group can escape.
As they progress through London they come across a mass of decomposing, infected bodies encircling the completely overgrown BT Tower and sprouting seed pods. Caldwell explains to the group that the pods contain spores that if released could end humankind. She reasons that she can save Helen and the human race for Melanie by making a vaccine. Melanie asks why her kind should die to save humanity if Caldwell admits that the children are in fact alive and not just imitators. Melanie runs back to the centre of London where she sets the towering seed-pod structure alight, causing it to germinate en masse and release an immense cloud of airborne spores. Not to soon after, Sgt. Parks finds Melanie by the BT Tower, fully ablaze and already seemingly infected by the spores. He cries out that this is the end of the world, whereas Melanie simply states its just ""not yours anymore"". He asks her to put him out his misery as he does not want to end up a hungry. He hands her his sidearm, and she tearfully obliges as he is about to turn. Melanie then returns to the lab to find Helen, standing just inside the hermetically sealed door, fearfully watching the spores fall around the lab.
The film closes with a tearful Helen awakening, secure from infection in the airlock, but effectively a prisoner inside the mobile med lab. Outside, sitting on the ground are the second generation children of the school/prison at the army base, along with the feral children all waiting and collected together, kept sternly in place by Melanie. Helen begins speaking through a microphone on outside speakers, once again to educate and teach all the children. It closes with Melanie asking for her favorite, a story, to which Helen politely declines and says not until bedtime. Melanie then responds that there'll be lots of time."

She reports to the police that the thief has medication along with her grandmother's silverware and a laptop computer. When she asks Detective William Bendix for advice, he chastises her for leaving her door unlocked. Ruth then goes door to door, asking her neighbors if they saw anything suspicious. One of them, Tony, becomes enraged that someone would target a neighbor. Frightened by his reaction, Ruth leaves; however, later, she returns to seek his help after the police refuse to follow up on a mobile app revealing the location of her laptop. Ruth and Tony go to the location, where Ruth intimidates the owner into returning her laptop. He reveals he bought it from a fence who operates a resale shop.

Ruth gets into a scuffle with the owner when he demands she pay for the stolen silverware. After he breaks her finger, Tony knocks him unconscious, and they flee.
After Ruth becomes frustrated that she was not able to confront the youth she suspects to be the burglar, Tony reveals that he caught the license plate number on the van he rode away in. Tony researches the tag number of the van online, revealing the owner of the van and possible thief as Christian Rumack. After again receiving no help from Bendix, Ruth and Tony impersonate cops at the address belonging to the van where a woman named Meredith lets them inside and answers their questions regarding Christian Rumack and the van. She reveals that the owner of the van, her husband Chris, is not the one who uses the van; it is instead her step-son, who was given the van by his father. She says Christian became disowned by his father after being jailed for drug-related offenses and befriending criminals he met there. Chris senior returns home abruptly with his bodyguard. Despite Chris offering a payoff, Ruth merely states that she has no interest in money and only wants to confront Christian about his behavior. Chris taunts her for her idealism and kicks them out.

Tony arrives and strikes Dez in the face with a throwing ninja star. When Dez tries to fire her gun at Tony, it backfires and explodes, blowing her hand off. Chris takes the opportunity to try to steal Marshall's gun, but Marshall accidentally shoots him through the head, killing him. Marshall points his gun at Tony next, but Ruth wrestles him to the ground. Dez stabs Tony several times in the stomach. Marshall's gun goes off as Ruth fights him, and a stray bullet strikes Dez in the head, killing her. Ruth gains the upper hand over Marshall, bludgeoning him in the head and leg with the butt of his own gun, and helps Tony flee into the forest behind the mansion. Marshall recovers and chases them. Ruth hides a severely injured Tony under some foliage and continues to run from Marshall. Ruth attacks Marshall by throwing rocks at him, and his sudden movements cause him to be bitten by a water moccasin. Ruth leaves him to die from his wounds. Panicked that she cannot find Tony on her way back, Ruth sees her grandmother's ghost point her in the correct direction. Grateful that Ruth saved her life, Meredith neglects to identify her as one of the burglars to Bendix. Ruth returns to her daily life with Tony, who survives his wounds, and she joins his church."
Logan,"In 2029, no mutants have been born in 25 years. Logan's healing ability has weakened and he has aged; he spends his days working as a limo driver in El Paso, Texas. In an abandoned smelting plant in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker Caliban care for nonagenarian Charles Xavier, Logan's mentor and founder of the X-Men. Charles, a psychic, suffers from a brain disease that causes him to have destructive seizures unless controlled with medication; a seizure a year earlier killed seven mutants, leaving Logan, Caliban, and Xavier as the last of the X-Men.
Gabriela Lopez, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, tries to hire Logan to escort her and an 11-year-old girl, Laura, to Eden, a refuge in North Dakota. Logan reluctantly accepts but finds Gabriela killed. He is confronted at his hideout by Gabriela's killer Donald Pierce, Transigen's cyborg chief of security, who is looking for Laura. Laura has stowed away in Logan's limo and has powers similar to Logan's. She, Logan, and Charles escape Pierce and his Reavers, but Caliban is captured and tortured by Pierce into tracking Laura.
A video on Gabriela's cellphone shows that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA samples to turn into weapons. Laura was created from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen had found an alternative, the children were to be killed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some of them escape.
In Oklahoma City, Logan discovers that Eden appears in an X-Men comic in Laura's possession and assumes it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Charles has a seizure and incapacitates everyone in the vicinity except for Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Charles with his medication. As they flee, Dr. Zander Rice, head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce.
Logan, Laura, and Charles help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident and accept an offer of dinner at their home. Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm harassing Will. Rice unleashes X-24, a clone of Logan in his prime, who murders Charles and Will's family, stabs Will and captures Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers while injuring Pierce. Logan fights X-24 but is outmatched. Will pins X-24 with his truck, but dies from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Charles's body.
After burying Charles, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to take her to Eden where they find Rictor and other Transigen children preparing to cross to Canada. Laura finds an adamantium bullet Logan has kept since his escape from Weapon X, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides his job is done and chooses not to accompany them, much to Laura's dismay.
The children are captured by the Reavers. Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily strengthens his physical and healing abilities. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers, but the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan, who killed Rice's father years ago while escaping from Weapon X, that no new mutants were born due to a Transigen virus that Rice created. Logan shoots Rice, killing him, and attacks Pierce. X-24, enraged by Rice's death, fights Logan. With their guards distracted, the children kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his seismic powers to flip a truck onto X-24, who then frees himself, drags Logan and impales him on a tree branch, mortally wounding him, but Laura shoots X-24 in the head with the adamantium bullet, killing him.
Near death, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon she was made to be, and after Laura finally tearfully acknowledges him as her father, Logan dies peacefully in Laura's arms. Laura and the children then mourn over Logan's death and bury him near a lake, just like Charles. After the burial, Laura turns the cross on Logan's grave on its side to create an X, to honor him as the last of the X-Men, and then departs with the other children to continue their journey across the frontier."
The Shack,"Mackenzie ""Mack"" Phillips suffered physical and emotional abuse as a child at the hands of his drunken father. He witnessed similar abuse of his mother as well. There is the implication that as a 13-year-old boy he attempted to poison his father with strychnine. Whether he succeeded in killing the man is not entirely clear, although subsequent events suggest that he did. But as an adult he has a bountiful life with his wife, Nan, and their three children: Kate, Josh and Missy.
Mack's life is shattered, however, when their youngest child Missy disappears during a camping trip while he is saving Kate and Josh during a canoeing accident. The police determine Missy is the victim of a serial killer after finding her torn dress and blood in a vacant cabin. Kate blames herself for Missy's death because of her own reckless behavior in causing the canoe accident in the first place. The tragedy derails Mack's faith and life until the onset of winter when he receives an unstamped, typewritten note in his mailbox. The surrounding snow is devoid of any incriminating tracks. The message is signed ""Papa"" (which was Nan's nickname for God) and invites him to meet at the cabin.
Thinking this may possibly be an opportunity for meeting and capturing or killing the serial killer, Mack drives himself there and, finding the ruined cabin cold and desolate and empty, is overcome with frustration, rage and an almost irresistible impulse to turn his handgun on himself. But he suddenly encounters a mysterious trio of strangers who invite him to stay at their well-furnished, cozy little house that is situated just down the path and, oddly, in the midst of a beautiful, sunshiny, summertime wilderness.
The trio of strangers gradually reveal their identities. The purpose of their invitation is to first help him to better understand his life as seen from a much broader context or higher perspective. This realization helps free him from an inclination to pass judgment upon himself as well as upon everyone else who crosses his path. It is from that new starting point that he may then continue his long, slow journey into healing for himself and his family and forgiveness for himself as well as for those who have grievously harmed him and his loved ones."

It's discovered that she was originally maid of honor but ""dropped out"" two months ago after her ex boyfriend Teddy, the bride's brother and the best man, broke up with her by text after two years together. Teddy is now back with his old girlfriend Nikki, who has replaced Eloise as maid of honor. At the reception, Eloise discovers she has been seated at Table 19. While she considers leaving early, she meets a man named Huck who notices her looking distressed and offers words of advice which are not well received.
Eloise decides to stay and meets her table mates: Jerry and Bina Kepp, Facebook friends with the groom's father who own a chain of diners; high-schooler Renzo Eckberg, whose parents are acquaintances of the groom and who came to the wedding in the hopes of meeting a girl; Jo Flanagan, Francie's childhood nanny; and Walter Thimble, the bride's cousin who is currently on parole. The table debates whether table 19 is a ""good table,"" to which Eloise responds that before getting dumped she planned half the wedding and knows for a fact that table 19 is for ""guests that should have known not to show up.""
As the newlyweds come in the reception hall and start dancing, Eloise starts feeling insecure and accepts a dance from Huck, whom she kisses. He declines to sit down with her and she realizes he is crashing the wedding and that ""Huck"" isn't his real name.
Although the six initially have difficulty finding anything to talk about, they swiftly band together when Jo realizes that Eloise is pregnant. The table confronts Teddy about dumping Eloise after she told him about the baby, and he reveals he dumped her because she said they would be ridiculous parents and he was tired of disappointing her. During this confrontation the wedding cake is destroyed as Eloise backs into it, knocking it onto Teddy. Bitter at this development and feeling unappreciated at the wedding, the Table 19 denizens quickly conceal the cake mishap, and go to Jo's room to smoke pot and converse about their reasons for attending the wedding. Walter reveals he went to prison for stealing 125,000 from the father of the bride, but only did so because he was conned into taking it by his former friend. Renzo tells the group that the wedding is the same night as his junior prom, but his mom encouraged him to come to the wedding instead as he would ""probably have a better chance of meeting someone."" Jo believes that the children she has cared for have now completely forgotten about her. Going out for a walk, Jerry offers Renzo some advice about how to pick up girls, while Eloise realizes that Jo has cancer. Jo admits that she is probably 'due' the same time Eloise will give birth. Eloise says she thinks she's having a girl and Jo asks that she not name her ""Jo"" as it's a tough name for a girl. Bina and Jerry fight and she tells him the reason she came to the wedding was to have an affair with an old flame, who has not shown up. They fight about their marriage, and Bina heads back inside with Walter.
On Jo's recommendation, the six attempt to find the wedding crasher that Eloise had encountered earlier, with the aid of the wedding photographer and the hotel reception staff. They learn that ""Huck"" is actually the groom from another wedding. As payback, Walter steals Huck's wedding cake to replace the one they destroyed earlier.
Returning to the wedding, Table 19 is visited by the bride and groom, who express genuine happiness that everyone there has attended. Francie and Eloise talk briefly, and Francie apologizes that Eloise was seated so far away from her for the reception, and Eloise decides to leave early. Francie then assures Jo that she has not forgotten her, telling a brief but touching childhood story about Teddy, inspiring the table to see him in a new light. The rest of the table tracks down Eloise and encourages her to tell him how she really feels. As the core wedding party leaves the hotel on a ferry, she shouts out an apology to him from the dock, but he's unable to hear.
Eloise, Walter, Jo, and Renzo return to the wedding hall for the last of the cake. In their room, the Kepps discuss their fragile marriage and reconcile before joining the others. The mood significantly changes when Teddy suddenly appears, dripping wet from apparently jumping off the boat and swimming to shore, and asks Eloise to repeat what she was trying to yell to him. Eloise asks that they both continue to be willing to forgive each other and they reconcile. Renzo asks the band to play them another song to which everybody dances, including Teddy.
A few months later, Jo has died of cancer and the Kepps are now happy and taking care of her dog. Renzo has a new girlfriend, and Walter refers to the other Table 19 guests as his family. Eloise and Teddy are together and have a son, who they have named Joe. The movie ends with Eloise and Teddy mailing birth announcements to their friends and family, including all the guests from Table 19."
Catfight,"The film opens showing the lives of two women, outsider artist Ashley Miller (Heche) and wealthy housewife Veronica Salt (Oh). Ashley is struggling to sell her dark and apocalyptic artwork, straining her relationship with her girlfriend Lisa, and she is also verbally abusive to her assistant Sally. Veronica, meanwhile, is an alcoholic who is treated with disdain by her husband Stanley, and although she loves her son Kip dearly, she carelessly mocks his drawing talent. Both women watch a political news show that reports escalating tension between the United States and the Middle East.
Stanley throws a birthday party for his business partner. Lisa, who is catering the party, forces Ashley to help her. While tending the bar, Veronica comes for a drink and the two women recognize each other from college - they were once friends, until Veronica suddenly stopped speaking to Ashley for unclear reasons. Although they both try to make pleasant small talk, they quickly offend each other and descend into bitter verbal barbs. After getting drunk, Veronica is told to leave by her husband, and she runs into Ashley smoking in the stairwell. The two sling hateful insults at each other, leading to a violent fight. Ashley ends up getting the upper hand, punching Veronica multiple times in the face before leaving. Veronica, badly injured, attempts to stand up but collapses down the stairs, falling into a coma.
Two years later, Veronica awakens in the hospital with no memory of her fight with Ashley. She is horrified to learn that while she was in a coma, her husband died in a car accident, her son died after joining the military following the reinstatement of the draft for the war in the Middle East, and all of her money was spent to pay for her treatment. Now broke and alone, Veronica moves in with her former housekeeper Donna and gets a job as a maid. Meanwhile, Ashley has become a famous artist after the war causes her dark paintings to become popular. She and Lisa also decide to start a family, and Ashley is successfully impregnated after they use a sperm donor; however, Ashley and Lisa's differing beliefs on how to prepare for the baby and raise it cause their relationship to once again become estranged.
One day while cleaning a hotel room, Veronica finds a magazine with Ashley on the front cover, and is annoyed that her old college friend is now successful. Veronica clashes with Donna over their opinions about the war, and she is forced to move in with her mentally unstable Aunt Charlie. Before leaving New York, Veronica finds a video recording left to her by Kip, who reveals he left art school to join the army because he believed it would make Veronica proud. Veronica breaks down in tears. Later, a drunk Veronica goes to the opening of Ashley's new gallery. When she sees a painting depicting her own bloodied face, Veronica suddenly remembers their fight and realizes Ashley is the reason she lost everything. Veronica goes into a rage and begins destroying the paintings, and Ashley is shocked to see her when she tries to stop her. Veronica punches Ashley and runs off with the painting of her face. Ashley runs after her into a construction site, where the two begin brutally beating each other with various tools. Veronica manages to overpower Ashley and hits her over the head several times with a wrench. Satisfied with her revenge, Veronica stumbles away. Ashley attempts to stand up, but a cinder block falls and hits her in the head, and she falls into a coma.
Two more years pass. Ashley awakens in the hospital and discovers that she lost her baby during the coma, Lisa has left her to begin a family with a man, and she is completely broke after all of her paintings were sold to pay her hospital bills. The United States has won the war on terror and completely westernized the Middle East, meaning that her dark art style has suddenly lost all popularity. Sally, meanwhile, has become immensely famous and wealthy after her comics about happy blue bunnies became popular after the end of the war. Ashley is now forced to work for her former assistant and attempts to begin painting again, only to find she is physically unable to do so because of her injuries, meaning her art career is ruined forever. Ashley has lost everything - just as Veronica did.
One night, Ashley asks Sally why she is being nice to her, and Sally unapologetically admits that she enjoys seeing Ashley so miserable because of the cruel treatment she received while working for her. Enraged, Ashley begins destroying the few possessions she has left, only to discover a bus ticket to Pennsylvania. Ashley realizes that the bus ticket belongs to Veronica. During the last two years, Veronica has been caring for her Aunt Charlie out in the middle of the woods, and has come to enjoy living away from the rest of the world. Veronica is surprised when Ashley suddenly appears at her home. Ashley blames Veronica for her misery, and intends to ""destroy"" her. Veronica calmly offers to make her breakfast beforehand, and Ashley reluctantly accepts.
While the two women eat, they discover that they have some things in common - they both hated the war with the Middle East, but didn't let that hate stop them from profiting off of it, and both of them deeply miss their lost children. Veronica shows Ashley the camera full of recordings made by Kip while he was deployed, and confesses that watching the clips makes her feel like her son is still with her, and has helped her overcome her anger and sadness towards Ashley. Ashley is moved, and for a moment it seems as though the two will be able to reconcile. However, Ashley accidentally spills her coffee onto the camera, frying it. Veronica freaks out, revealing she never backed up the files on the camera, and blames Ashley for destroying it. Ashley gets mad and calls Veronica an idiot. The two begin fighting for the third time, taking their brawl from the house and into the woods. The fight starts out just as brutal as their previous fights, but it soon loses all passion, and the two women end up just sitting on the ground punching each other over and over again as they both break down sobbing.
Aunt Charlie watches the two fight from the window. The video camera suddenly reboots, revealing it wasn't broken after all, and showing that all of Ashley and Veronica's fighting is completely pointless."
Donald Cried,A Manhattanite banker returns to his hometown to pick up an urn and forgets his wallet. He seeks help from a home across the street only to find that it is still occupied by his high school neighbor who holds him hostage.
Kong: Skull Island,"In 1944, in the midst of World War II, two fighter pilots – American pilot Hank Marlow and Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari – parachute onto an island in the South Pacific after a dogfight and engage in close combat, but the fight is interrupted by a giant ape.
Twenty-nine years later, in 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa hires former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad, a skilled tracker, to guide an expedition to map out a recently discovered island known as Skull Island. Their military escort is the Sky Devils, a U.S. Army helicopter squadron newly returned from the Vietnam War and led by Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard and his subordinates, Major Jack Chapman and Captain Earl Cole. The group is joined by pacifist photojournalist Mason Weaver, who believes the expedition is a secret military operation and plans to expose it. Upon arrival at Skull Island, Packard's men begin dropping explosives, developed by seismologist Houston Brooks, to map out the island and prove his Hollow Earth theory. However, the air unit is attacked by the same giant ape from 1944, who kills a number of military personnel and scatters the survivors across the island.
Packard regroups with some of the scattered survivors, including Randa, Cole, his door gunner Reles, pilot Glenn Mills, and Landsat employee Steve Woodward. After being confronted by Packard, Randa reveals his affiliation to the secret government organization Monarch, and its plan to use the expedition to prove the existence of monsters and determine their threat to humanity. Packard's group begins making their way to Chapman, whose helicopter crash-landed elsewhere. Meanwhile, the other group of survivors, consisting of Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin, soldier Reg Slivko, and Landsat employee Victor Nieves, try to get to a rendezvous point to meet a resupply team arriving in three days' time. Along the way, the survivors have various encounters with the island's creatures.
Conrad's group eventually encounters the local Iwi natives and an older Marlow. Marlow reveals the ape is Kong, the island's guardian, worshiped as a god by the natives for protecting them from many predators, including two-legged, lizard-like monsters dubbed ""Skullcrawlers"". He informs them Kong attacked and destroyed the air unit because their bombs brought the subterranean Skullcrawlers to the surface; the Skullcrawlers are responsible for killing Kong's ancestors, leaving him as the last of his kind. Marlow also tells them that he and Ikari became friends, but Ikari was killed by a Skullcrawler some time ago. He also says they are fortunate that they didn't awaken ""the Big One"", the largest of the Skullcrawlers.
Chapman is ambushed and eaten by a Skullcrawler, while Conrad's group helps Marlow complete a boat built from parts scavenged from Marlow and Ikari's downed planes. They ride down the river, and manage to secure communication with Packard's group, but the boat is attacked by pterosaur-like creatures that kill Nieves. They regroup with Packard, who insists on searching for Chapman, though his true objective is to secure weapons and kill Kong, who he perceives as an enemy due to killing his men. Marlow leads the two groups to a mass grave littered with the bones of Kong's kin. There, the same Skullcrawler that killed Chapman attacks the group, killing Randa and many soldiers before dying in a flammable gas explosion triggered by Weaver. Learning about Chapman's death, a vengeful Packard becomes even more determined to kill Kong and avenge his fallen men. The group parts ways, with Packard's group retrieving weapons from Chapman's chopper and laying a trap for Kong at a nearby lake, while the non-military personnel head back to the boat. While scouting the path ahead, Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong up close and, seeing his true peaceful nature, they resolve to save him.
As Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong, Packard's group uses the remaining seismic charges to lure him in. Kong charges to the lake, where Packard incapacitates him with ignited napalm, though Woodward is killed. Conrad, Weaver, and Marlow arrive and persuade the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard refuses to stand down. A massive Skullcrawler, the Big One, emerges from the lake and Packard is crushed to death by a recovering Kong. The Skullcrawler overpowers Kong and chases the humans to a marsh at the island's edge. Cole is killed in a failed suicide bomb attempt to kill it. Kong returns to rescue the others and battle the beast, and is aided by the survivors. Weaver is knocked into the marsh during the fight but Kong saves her from drowning. The Skullcrawler then tries to kill Kong and eat Weaver, but Kong finally kills it by tearing out its tongue and eviscerating it, and allows the survivors to leave the island.
During the credits, Marlow is shown returning home, reuniting with his wife, meeting his son for the first time, and watching a Chicago Cubs game on television. In a post-credits scene, Conrad and Weaver are detained and recruited by Monarch. They are informed by Brooks and San that Skull Island is just the beginning and that Kong is not the only monster king to roam the world. As proof, they are shown archive footage of cave paintings depicting the monsters Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah."

Beauty and the Beast,"A beautiful enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, a rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses, she reveals her identity. To punish the prince for his selfishness, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, the prince and his servants from the memories of their loved ones. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the curse will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return, before the last petal falls.
Some years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of a music box maker and artist Maurice, dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier. On his way to a convention and lost in the forest, Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.
Belle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a friendship develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a plague doctor mask and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the plague.
In Villeneuve, Gaston sees rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, and agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime but is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.
After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity.

Ungrateful and unrepentant, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, but it collapses when the castle crumbles, and he falls to his death. The Beast dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. As Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms and the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily."
The Belko Experiment,"Mike Milch (John Gallagher Jr.), an employee of Belko Industries, arrives at his remote office building in rural Bogotá, Colombia, to find unfamiliar security guards turning away the local Colombian staff at the gate. Everyone else at the non-profit company — has been there for a little over a year. New employee Dany (Melonie Diaz) reports for her first day on the job, and is told that a tracking device is implanted in the base of every Belko employee's skull in case they are kidnapped. This is common in Colombia due to the high incidence of kidnapping and Belko being a wealthy company.
Evan (James Earl), Belko's head security guard, does not know who the new security guards are, nor why the Colombian staff have been barred from entering. Mike also sees the guards moving in and out of an airplane hangar next door. He tells Evan and both are confused.
With the local staff gone, the eighty employees left at the office go about their day as usual. Once the eightieth employee shows up for her job, a voice on the intercom then instructs the co-workers to kill two of their co-workers, or else four workers will be killed at random. Several staff attempt to flee the building, but steel shutters suddenly rise up, sealing off the outside walls and doors and locking them all in. They ignore the announcement at first, believing it to be a prank, but four employees die when explosives hidden in their trackers detonate and blow their heads apart. The employees believe the deaths are due to sniper fire at first, but Mike realizes the actual cause and attempts to remove his tracker with a box cutter. Warned by the voice that he too will die unless he stops within ten seconds, Mike gives up the idea.
The group is next told that unless thirty of them are dead within two hours, sixty will be killed. They split into two factions, one led by Mike who believes that there should be no killing, and chief operating officer boss Barry (Tony Goldwyn) who intends to follow the directions in order to save himself. Barry and his group attempt to burn off the lock of the armory in order to gain access to its weapons, as Evan refuses to hand over the keys. Mike and his group, including his girlfriend Leandra (Adria Arjona), Evan and employees Keith (Josh Brener) and Roberto (David Del Rio), try to hang banners from the roof of the building as a call for help, but soldiers outside shoot at them, hitting Keith in the hand. The voice warns that unless they stop, all involved will be killed, forcing them to abandon the plan. Barry, executive Wendell (John C. McGinley), and employee Terry (Owain Yeoman) knock Mike out, kill Evan, grab Leandra, and take Evan's keys to the armory.
With his group now armed, Barry orders everyone down to the lobby and tries to calm them down. He and Wendell select thirty people, including Mike, forcing them to kneel in a line. He begins executing them with a gunshot to the back of the head. Dany, who has been hiding in the basement, hears gunshots and goes up to the floor, sees what is happening, and runs back to the basement. She shuts off the building's lights before Mike and several others can be killed.
Barry and Wendell hunt down the fleeing employees, as the voice informs them that only twenty-nine have been killed. Terry attacks Leandra, but she gains the upper hand and opts to spare him, only for the two-hour time limit to run out. Terry and Keith, along with twenty-nine other employees, have their trackers explode, leaving only 16 survivors. The voice informs them that the one who kills the most people by the end of the day will be allowed to walk out alive. The voice lists the people who have killed the most. Barry finds Dany and Roberto hiding in the elevator shaft, but Dany escapes while Roberto is crushed and killed by the ceiling on one of the floors. Two employees, Marty (Sean Gunn) and Chet (Abraham Benrubi) collect the unexploded trackers from the heads of people who have died by other methods, planning to use them to blow up the wall. Marty and Chet group up with Leandra, but are soon killed by Wendell. Leandra manages to kill Wendell, and Mike takes the trackers. While Mike and Leandra escape, Barry kills Vince and Dany, and shoots Leandra, who dies from her wound shortly after. Mike and Barry are left as the only two survivors.
In a rage, Mike chases Barry. The two fight briefly and Mike kills Barry with a tape dispenser. The building is then unsealed, as he is the last survivor, and the soldiers escort him to the hangar next door. There, he meets the owner of the voice (Gregg Henry), who introduces himself as a social scientist who believes that discoveries about human nature can only come from placing people in extreme environments. As he and his colleagues begin to question Mike about his emotional and mental state, Mike notices a panel of switches that correspond to the eighty employees. Having planted the trackers that Marty collected on the soldiers and the Voice, he charges across the room and flips every switch except his own. The trackers explode, killing the soldiers and wounding the Voice, before Mike grabs a gun and kills the remaining scientists. The Voice then attempts to reason with Mike, stating how Mike has shown he believes life is sacred. Mike then unloads the rest of the magazine into the Voice’s head, killing him. He then leaves the warehouse in a state of shock. The view zooms out to reveal that Mike is one of many sole survivors from similar experiments, being watched by another group through security cameras. A new voice states ""end stage one"" and ""commence stage two."""

The Devil's Candy,"Late at night in a countryside house, Raymond Smilie hears a voice. He reacts by playing his red Flying V loudly in front of a crucifix. His mother enters his room and unplugs the guitar. When Ray awkwardly explains he plays to avoid hearing ""Him,"" she says he needs to return to the hospital. Ray continues to hear the voice and kills his mother, who falls down the stairs. Shortly after, a man enters the house and sees the dead woman.
Some time later, the house is sold to Jesse Hellman, a struggling painter. Jesse, along with his wife Astrid and daughter Zooey, move into the house. Elsewhere, Ray checks into a motel. He listens to tapes preaching about the Devil, and plays his guitar. When a noise complaint brings a police officer to his room, Ray stops playing.
After settling in, Jesse starts hearing voices. Inspired, he paints a black and white painting based on an upside down cross motif. Jesse later approaches Belial, an art gallery whose owner Leonard previously turned away his portfolio. At his insistence, the receptionist looks at the scan of the painting and appears pleased. One evening, Ray shows up and has a brief conversation with Zooey, who tells him she would love to have a Flying V. Ray wants to enter the house, but a disturbed Jesse turns him away.
The next morning, Zooey and Jesse find Ray's Flying V outside their house, but Jesse refuses to let her keep it. Elsewhere, Ray kidnaps a young boy. He carries the boy to a motel room, cuts up his body and puts it in a suitcase. Ray buries the boy in a hole already filled with several suitcases. Meanwhile, Jesse paints a new painting with distorted faces of children - including the one Ray killed. Immersed in his work, he forgets to pick up Zooey at school, and to appease her, he lets her keep Ray's guitar. Jesse keeps working on the painting, which depicts the children's heads being devoured by a black creature, and adds Zooey being burned alive. He tells a horrified Astrid that the he feels the children inside him screaming to be let out.
At night, Ray sneaks into Zooey's bedroom. He covers her mouth and explains that ""He"" wants her, but Ray is trying to avoid hurting her. Zooey agrees to stay quiet, but then screams, alerting Astrid and Jesse. Ray flees. The Hellmans go to the police, who begin identifying the man.
The next day, Leonard arrives to see Jesse's latest work. Pleased with the painting, Leonard offers him some wine. Despite his initial hesitation as he needs to pick up Zooey at school, Jesse drinks with Leonard. As he rushes to Zooey's school, his car tires blows out and he runs to the school, but Zooey is nowhere to be found. In Ray's motel bathroom, Zooey is tied up with duct tape. Ray tells Zooey that he can no longer resist ""Him,"" and that ""He"" considers her ""the sweetest candy."" While Ray prepares to kill her, Zooey frees herself and escapes. At the police station, the Hellmans are reunited. The police tells Jesse of Ray's identity and history of mental illness. Ray explained that he served the Devil, and that the murdered children were ""His candy"". The Hellmans are escorted home, and two police officers are stationed outside the house, with the intention of placing them under witness protection the following day.
That same night, Ray kills the two police officers and takes a gun from them. He shoots Jesse and Astrid, drags Zooey upstairs into her room, splashes gasoline on the floor, then sets the room on fire. Astrid, still alive, wakes Jesse up and the two leave the house. Jesse climbs through Zooey's bedroom window, fights Ray, and bludgeons him to death with his own guitar.
Jesse gets Zooey safely to the ground. He walks to a spot near the house, where he finds the children's bodies that Ray had buried. As the sun rises, Jesse looks to the sky, smiles, and starts to cry."
Power Rangers,"In the Cenozoic era, six interplanetary warriors, the Power Rangers, are tasked with protecting life on Earth and the Zeo Crystal. The Green Ranger, Rita Repulsa, betrays them and plans to dominate the universe. The Red Ranger, Zordon, survives Rita's attack and hides five of the Rangers' power source, the Power Coins. He orders Alpha 5, his robotic assistant, to perform a meteor strike that kills him, the dinosaurs, and sends Rita to the bottom of the sea, foiling her scheme.
In 21st-century Angel Grove, high school football star Jason Scott is dismissed from the team and placed under house arrest after a failed prank. In detention, he encounters Billy Cranston and Kimberly Hart. After defending Billy from a bully, Billy offers to deactivate Jason's ankle monitor for help at an old gold mine that evening. Once there, Jason leaves to explore and runs into Kimberly. Billy detonates explosives to break some rock, attracting the attention of Jason, Kimberly and nearby students Trini and Zack. The five discover the Power Coins and each take one. While escaping mine security, their car is hit by a train. The five find themselves at home the next morning and discover that the coins have granted them superhuman abilities. Elsewhere, Rita's body is found. Waking, she goes on a rampage, hunting pieces of gold to raise her minion Goldar to find the Zeo Crystal.
The five teenagers return to the mine and discover an ancient spaceship where they meet Alpha 5 and Zordon's consciousness. They inform the teenagers about the Rangers history and Rita, warning that they have eleven days until Rita has her full power, finds the Zeo Crystal, and uses it to destroy life on Earth. The five leave the ship with no intention of returning until Zordon pleads with Jason to convince the team.
The five return to train the next day, but they cannot morph. They spend the next week training against simulated Putties and trying unsuccessfully to morph. To inspire the Rangers, Alpha reveals the Zords. Zack takes his Zord out for a joyride and almost kills the other Rangers when he crashes it. This angers Jason, and they fight. While trying to separate the two, Billy spontaneously morphs. However, when he becomes conscious of it, the armor disappears. Angered at their lack of progress, Zordon dismisses the group. Jason returns to the ship to confront Zordon and discovers that once the Rangers morph, it will open the Morphing Grid and allow Zordon to restore himself in a physical body. Feeling betrayed, Jason accuses Zordon of using the team for his own benefit. That night, the team camp at the mine and bond with each other.
Later that night, Rita attacks Trini and orders her to bring the Rangers to the docks. Trini informs them about Rita and they arrive to fight, but are quickly defeated. Rita forces Billy to reveal the location of the Zeo Crystal, which he'd figured out, kills him, and releases the others. The Rangers take Billy's body to the ship and ask Zordon to resurrect him. The Rangers agree they would give their lives for each other and resolve to defeat Rita. In doing so, they unlock the Morphing Grid. Zordon revives Billy, sacrificing being able to restore his physical self. With the team restored and confident, the Rangers morph into their armor.
Rita creates Goldar, raises an army of Putties, and attacks Angel Grove to find the Zeo Crystal. The Rangers battle the Putties and head to Angel Grove in their Zords. After the Rangers destroy the Putties, Goldar pushes the Rangers and their Zords into a fiery pit. In the pit, the Zords combine and form the Megazord. Rita merges with Goldar. The Rangers battle and destroy Goldar. After refusing Jason's offer to surrender, a defiant Rita tells the Rangers that more will come for the crystal and leaps at the Megazord only to be slapped into space. The Rangers are praised as local heroes, and with Rita's threats foiled, they return to their normal lives while keeping their powers.
In a mid-credits scene, in detention, the teacher announces that Tommy Oliver will be joining them, but the desk is empty save for a green jacket.[note 1]"
Life,"In the near future, the unmanned Pilgrim 7 space probe returns from Mars to Earth orbit with soil samples potentially containing evidence of extraterrestrial life. The probe is captured and its samples retrieved by the International Space Station and its six-member crew. Exobiologist Hugh Derry, who is paralyzed from the waist down, revives a dormant cell from the sample, which quickly grows into a multi-celled organism that American school children name ""Calvin"". Hugh realizes that Calvin's cells can change their specialisation, acting as muscle, sensor, and neuron cells all at once.
An accident in the lab causes Calvin to become dormant; Hugh attempts to revive Calvin with electric shocks, but Calvin immediately becomes hostile and attacks Hugh, crushing his hand. While Hugh lies unconscious from Calvin's attack, Calvin uses Hugh's electric shock tool to escape its enclosure; now free in the laboratory, Calvin devours a lab rat by absorbing it, growing in size. Engineer Rory Adams enters the lab to rescue Hugh; he is locked in by fellow crew member and physician David Jordan, however, to keep Calvin contained. Calvin latches onto Rory's leg; after Rory unsuccessfully attacks Calvin with a portable rocket thruster, Calvin enters his mouth, devouring his organs from the inside and killing him. Emerging from Rory's mouth even larger, Calvin escapes through a fire-control vent.
Finding their communication with Earth cut off due to overheating of the communication systems, ISS commander Ekaterina Golovkina performs a space walk to find and fix the problem. She discovers that Calvin has breached the ISS's cooling system; soon after, Calvin attacks her, rupturing her spacesuit's water coolant system in the process and causing the water in the system to fill her suit. She blindly makes her way back to the airlock; however, she and the crew realize that if she re-enters, Calvin will also be able to re-enter the ISS. Hence, she refuses to open the hatch and stops David from helping her do so; this keeps Calvin out of the station for the time being but also causes her to drown and die in her spacesuit.
Calvin then attempts to re-enter the station through its maneuvering thrusters. The crew try to fire the thrusters to blast Calvin away from the spacecraft, but their attempts fail, using up too much fuel and causing the ISS to enter a decaying orbit where it will burn up in Earth's atmosphere. Pilot Sho Murakami informs the crew that they need to use the station's remaining fuel to get back into a safe orbit, although this allows Calvin to re-enter the station. The crew plan to make Calvin dormant by sealing themselves into one module and venting the atmosphere from the rest of the station.
After the remaining crew finalize preparations to do so, Hugh enters cardiac arrest. The crew then discover that Calvin has been feeding off of Hugh's paralyzed leg. Calvin attacks the remainder of the crew; Sho seals himself in a sleeping pod. As Calvin attempts to break its glass, David and the quarantine officer Miranda North use Hugh's corpse as bait to lure Calvin away from Sho and trap it in another module to deprive it of oxygen. Having received a distress call prior to the damage to the ISS's communication system, Earth sends a Soyuz spacecraft to the station as a fail-safe plan to push the station into deep space. Believing the Soyuz to be on a rescue mission for the ISS crew, Sho leaves his pod and moves to board it, forcing open its hatch; Calvin then attacks him and the Soyuz crew, causing the craft's docking mechanism to fail and resulting in the capsule crashing into the ISS, killing Sho and the Soyuz crew and causing the ISS to once again enter a decaying orbit.
The only two remaining survivors, David and Miranda, aware that Calvin could survive re-entry, plan for David to lure Calvin into one of the two remaining escape pods attached to the ISS for David to manually pilot the pod into deep space, isolating Calvin and allowing Miranda to return to Earth in the second pod. David manages to lure Calvin into his pod while Miranda enters her pod; as they simultaneously undock their pods from the ISS, one of the pods hits debris and is damaged, veering off course. In David's pod, Calvin attacks him as he struggles to manually pilot the pod; in Miranda's pod, she records a black box message in case of her death during re-entry informing the world of her colleagues' deaths and not to trust Calvin nor any extraterrestrial life from Mars as well as to destroy Calvin at any cost should he make his way to Earth.
The two pods separate, one earthbound, the other spiraling away from Earth. The earthbound pod lands in the ocean; two nearby Vietnamese fishermen approach it. As they look into the pod, it is revealed to be David's, the astronaut now encased in a web-like substance. Meanwhile, Miranda's pod's navigation system fails due to damage sustained from the debris, sending her flying away from Earth out of control, much to her horror. On Earth, despite David attempting to warn the fishermen, the fishermen open the pod's hatch. Meanwhile, more boats arrive."
CHiPs,"The film begins with a getaway driver waiting for his crew in a Miami bank. Following a brief car chase, the driver reveals himself as Special Agent Castillo (Michael Peña) of the FBI. He then arrests the criminal crew who killed his former partner. During the arrest, Castillo fires his service weapon through his partner's, Special Agent Clay Allen's (Adam Brody), shoulder. He then proceeded to show a naked photo of the criminal's wife to prove Castillo's affair with her.
Meanwhile, at the training center for the California Highway Patrol, Jon Baker (Dax Shepard) is a trainee who is awaiting his final exam to graduate. Failing a series of simple tests, he is placed at the desk of CHP Sergeant Gail Hernandez (Maya Rudolph) for a final interview and decision. Hernandez acknowledges his ability to ""ride"" a motorcycle better than the majority of the cadets she trained. She grants him probationary approval to graduate pending a performance review based on Citations, Arrests and Good overall evaluations from Superiors.
During the interview he mentions his past as a motocross competition champion and the fallout resulting from his injuries on the track. After losing all he had gained, from sponsors to contracts, Baker's wife Karen (Kristen Bell) divorced him and allowed Baker to remain a resident of their estate in the guest house.
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, the California Highway Patrol begins a pursuit with a crew of robbers that ride motorcycles following their robbery of an armored car. During the chase, a CHP Air Unit is overhead. The helicopter's pilot recognizes the Armed Guard that is being held hostage and is told by the hostage taker to jump from the chopper to prove his love. The pilot subsequently jumps to his death. The guard is told by the Hostage Taker, referred to as ""L.T."", to return the money he stole as part of the crew.
In Miami, Castillo's boss Agent Peterson (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) notifies him that his actions resulted in the Bureau convening a review panel to consider terminating Castillo from the FBI. Following the conversation, he orders Castillo to go undercover in California to help investigate the series of armored car robberies with alleged connections to the police.
Castillo is given the alias of Officer Frank (Ponch) Poncherello in the California Highway Patrol's LA District. Unknown to the officers, CHP Lieutenant Raymond Kurtz (Vincent D'Onofrio) is the leader of a small group of corrupt CHP Officers. The group is committing these robberies to gather money for Kurtz's heroin addicted son (Justin Chatwin) to escape the access to drugs he has in LA.
Now undercover as Officer Poncherello he arrives at his assigned station. There he is partnered with Baker who immediately shows the inability to speak to women as fellow Officer Ava Perez (Rosa Salazar) invites him to take a motorcycle tour of her favorite route. Baker mistakes this as an attempt to hit on him, which angers Perez greatly.
Following a long time in a public restroom, Baker accuses Ponch of masturbating multiple times a day to refrain from his sexual addiction. As they discuss the issue, Ponch brings up the fact that if Baker hasn't had sex with his wife for than a year, it obviously means that someone is doing her for him. During that argument, the robbery crew makes another attempt at an armored truck job. The crew shoots and kills two CHP Officers during the attempt prompting a police response. While responding the crew evades them using Ducati motorcycles. Baker then saves Ponch from being run over by a trucker who was unfocused on the road.
During another chase, Baker encounters Kurtz' son. The two begin a pursuit that results in Lieutenant Kurtz running Baker over with a SWAT van after his son is decapitated and subsequently killed by a steel cable. Officer Perez (Rosa Salazar) begins CPR and the air unit is called in to airlift Baker to a hospital while Kurtz escapes easily. Following the incident, Castillo is held responsible by the FBI Agent in charge of the case for the 3 CHP officers and 2 FBI agents that were injured.
During that time, Baker is confronted by Officer Perez and asked if he would like to get a ride home from her. Baker responds that he would like to wait for his wife to come for him. Perez leaves upset about the encounter. While this is happening, Castillo mistakenly dials Captain Jane Lindel and begins sexting her. Upon seeing her naked and having an episode of Premature ejaculation, Castillo destroys his phone.
The next day, Peterson travels to LA to speak to Castillo since his phone wasn't working. Upon seeing the level of destruction Castillo caused, Peterson agrees with the panel's decision and terminates Castillo from the FBI. With no one picking him up from his discharge, Baker is met by Castillo and the two discuss the sexting issue and his termination from the bureau.
Baker and Castillo return to the Baker residence to find that Karen (Kristen Bell) and her new boyfriend Rick (Josh Duhamel) sold the house and all of Baker's assets to another family. They sit down and enjoy dinner together while discussing the case. There, after seeing the photo of the severed head of the suspect, Baker realizes that the suspect competed against him in the Motocross sport. They begin a simple Google Search that reveals the full legal name of the suspect and the clear connection to the CHP Lieutenant as the suspect was a motocross competitor named ""Reed Jr"". The search gave a Wikipedia page that made the connection to the Kurtz family as the Lieutenant's son.
Together, they approach CHP Captain Jane Lindel (Jane Kaczmarek) to demand resources from the CHP and to arrest the five officers they've discovered to be working with Kurtz. However, Castillo realizes that he was fired from the FBI and no longer acts as a officer of the law. Captain Linden subsequently swears him in as a CHP Officer. Meanwhile, Kurtz Jr's cousin and corrupt CHP Officer, Brian Grieves (Ryan Hansen), was discharged by fellow corrupt CHP Officer and Castillo's love interest Lindsey Taylor (Jessica McNamee). Officer Ava Perez, upon arrving too late to apprehend them, begins recruiting a group of officers to go on the hunt.
Now formally a CHP Officer, Castillo recruits Baker into the hunt for the Kurtz crew. As they gear up, Kurtz sends a photo of Karen tied up and demands that they come to a location in the middle of the desert. There, Kurtz opens fire and shoots Castillo's fingers off. As Kurtz enters he begins a fistfight with Baker and Castillo. During the fistfight, fellow CHP members led by Officer Ava Perez encounter heavy gunfire from the corrupt Officers guarding the location.
Following an attempt to shoot Kurtz, Baker shoots an explosive resulting in a massive explosion of the bunker. However, Kurtz is still alive and begins another fistfight with Baker. Lindsey Taylor arrives and fakes an arrest. She places the pistol in Kurtz' hands and reveals herself as a crew member. Kurtz fires the pistol into Baker's arm three times with the third bullet splinting off of his titanium arm implant into Kurtz' head, killing him instantly. Baker reveals his arm was titanium following an injury in a motocross competition that he won 1st place in. Meanwhile, a fistfight begins between Officer Perez and Taylor ending in Perez taking Taylor into custody.
While in the ambulance to the hospital, they encounter a Paramedic (Erik Estrada) who treats Castillo's injuries. With them is Officer Perez, who was asked to ride in the ambulance by Baker. Baker and Perez begin having sex in the Ambulance as Castillo and the Paramedic (Estrada) converse, in Spanish, on Perez' body and Baker's inability to perform anal sex. The movie ends with Perez acknowledging the comments and revealing that she does speak Spanish, understanding what they're saying.
A final cut scene shows Castillo receiving a call from his former FBI boss, Agent Peterson, offering his FBI position back to which he responds that he'd prefer to stay in the CHP."
Ghost in the Shell,"In the near future, humans are augmented with cybernetic improvements to traits such as vision, strength, and intelligence. Augmentation developer Hanka Robotics establishes a secret project to develop an artificial body, or ""shell"", that can integrate a human brain rather than an AI. Mira Killian, the sole survivor of a cyberterrorist attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer, Dr. Ouelet, Hanka CEO Cutter decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative.
A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa under Chief Daisuke Aramaki. Killian, who experiences hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as glitches, is troubled by how little she remembers of her past. The team thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a robotic geisha after it murders a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity known as Kuze, Killian breaks protocol and ""dives"" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. They trace the hacker to a yakuza nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The explosion destroys Batou's eyes and damages Killian's body. Cutter is enraged by Killian's actions, and threatens to have Section 9 shut down unless Aramaki keeps her in line.
Kuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers and realize that Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet. Batou, now with cybernetic eyes, kills one while the repaired Killian subdues the other. While they interrogate the worker, Kuze speaks through him before compelling him to commit suicide. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers a large number of humans mentally linked as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured and Kuze reveals that he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian. He urges her to question her own memories, then frees her and escapes.
Killian confronts Ouelet, who admits that 98 test subjects died before Killian, and that her memories are implanted. Cutter has decided that Killian is a liability and orders Ouelet to kill her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated.
Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter, Motoko Kusanagi, ran away from home a year ago and was arrested. Motoko took her own life while in custody. Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who allows Cutter to remotely eavesdrop on their conversation. Batou, Togusa, and Aramaki eliminate Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. There, she and Kuze meet and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka as test subjects.
Cutter deploys a ""spider-tank"" to kill them. Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear off the tank's motor, losing an arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze offers to merge his ""ghost"" with Killian's, but Killian refuses. Kuze fades out, then a Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, Killian, now repaired and embracing her true identity as the Japanese Motoko, reconnects with her mother and returns to work with Section 9."
The Boss Baby,"A man named Tim Templeton tells a story about his 7-year-old self and his parents, Ted and Janice. One day, Tim is surprised when an infant wearing a business suit arrives at his house in a taxi, and Ted and Janice call him Tim's little brother. Tim is envious of the attention the baby receives, not to mention suspicious when the infant acts odd around him.
Soon, Tim learns that the baby can talk like an adult, and he introduces himself as ""The Boss"". Seeing an opportunity to be rid of him, Tim decides to record a conversation between the Boss Baby and other toddlers who are at Tim's house for a meeting. The Boss Baby and the other infants catch Tim with the recording, and the cassette tape is terminated after the Boss Baby threatens to tear up Tim's favorite stuffed animal, Lam-Lam. With no evidence to support him, Tim's parents ground him for three weeks.
The Boss Baby apologizes to Tim and has him suck on a pacifier that transports them to Baby Corp., a place where infants with adult-like minds work to preserve infant love everywhere. The Boss Baby explains that he was sent to see why puppies are being loved more than infants. He has infiltrated Tim's residence because his parents work for Puppy Co., which will unleash a new puppy on ""take your child to work day"". The Boss Baby stays intelligent by drinking a ""Secret Baby Formula"" that enables a baby to act like an adult. However, if a baby does not drink it after a period of time, he or she becomes a regular baby. When they overhear Boss Baby's boss threaten to fire him for not bringing in information, which would strip him of his formula and strand him at the Templetons, he and Tim agree to work together to prevent that.
Tim's parents lift the grounding and take them to Puppy Co. While there, they slip away and find what they think is the plans for a ""Forever Puppy"", but they are captured by the company's founder and CEO, Francis E. Francis. They discover that Francis used to be the head of Baby Corp. and Boss Baby's idol, but was fired when it was discovered that his lactose intolerance kept the secret formula from working properly. Francis intends to have the Forever Puppies overshadow babies by stealing Boss Baby's serum bottle and infecting the puppies with it. Tim's parents go with Francis to Las Vegas, and Francis has his brother Eugene pose as Tim and Boss Baby's babysitter to keep them from interfering.
Without a steady flow of formula to keep his intelligence in check, Boss Baby starts becoming a normal baby. Despite this, he and Tim evade the ""babysitter"" long enough to reach the airport but are too late to intercept Tim's parents. They sneak on to another plane bound for Las Vegas. There, they stall Francis' presentation when Eugene unwittingly gives away their plan. Furious at their interference, Francis locks Tim's parents up so he can burn them with exhaust from a rocket used to launch the Forever Puppies. Tim and Boss Baby push him off a ledge, making Francis tumble into the formula. Boss Baby opens the rocket to let the puppies out so they can save Tim's parents. His return to baby state is complete while on the rocket, but the baby starts crying and Tim sings to him with the family song to show his appreciation, causing him to jump off the rocket before it launches. After the rocket does launch, Francis tries to attack Boss Baby, but is picked up by Eugene and is raised without revenge in his mind.
Boss Baby is promoted and leaves. Tim goes back to being an only child, but he and Boss Baby miss each other. After Tim writes a letter convincing him to live with him as his brother, Boss Baby returns to the Templeton family as a regular baby named Theodore Lindsey ""Ted"" Templeton.
Back in the present, Tim is now an adult and the father of two daughters, one of whom acts like Ted did when he was Boss Baby."
The Zookeeper's Wife,"Dr. Jan Żabiński (Johan Heldenbergh) and his wife, Antonina (Jessica Chastain), are the keepers of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest and most prolific zoos in 1930s Europe. In the calm of August 1939, Antonina rides her bicycle through the beautiful zoo grounds, greeting a hippo, horses, bison, and followed faithfully by Adam, a baby camel. She opens the zoo gates with Jerzyk (Michael McElhatton), another zookeeper. A crowd has already gathered to view the many species on display. Jan is the director of the zoo and faces the scornful, yet envious advances of a colleague, Dr. Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl), the head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist.
On September 1, 1939, Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) are shocked witnesses to the aerial bombardment of Warsaw as German forces storm Poland. The zoo is not spared; bombs raze the cages and kill many of the animals. Lions, tigers, monkeys and kangaroo take to the streets. As Polish resistance collapses under overwhelming odds, Heck arrives at the zoo, convincing Antonina to let him save her prize animals as a ""loan."" He promises to return them to Warsaw when the war ends, which he believes will be soon. With the onset of winter, Heck returns with Nazi soldiers, but this time he has come to shoot the remaining animals, which he says will otherwise die in the cold. Something sinister has invaded Heck, revealed in the cold delight he takes in shooting an eagle, then casually telling an aide to have it stuffed. It becomes evident that Heck has begun to keep a subtle, romantic eye on Antonina.
Warsaw becomes the scene of monstrous upheaval. Jewish-owned shops are shuttered, and Jews are herded into the Ghetto. Wearing Star of David armbands, two of the Zabinskis' friends, Maurycy Fraenkel (Iddo Goldberg) and his partner Magda Gross (Efrat Dor), seek a haven, not for themselves but for another friend's notable insect collection. Antonina makes an unusual offer to shelter Magda in an attic closet. Jan and Antonina take stock of what defiance of the Germans would mean, and how dangerous it would be: they can be shot simply for offering a Jew a glass of water. But they come to the realization that, in their zoo, they can save one life. Magda Gross is the first.
With the zoo abandoned, Jan and Antonina seek out Heck at his headquarters in Warsaw. The couple make a daring proposal to turn the zoo into a pig farm. They secretly hope to help Jews by bringing food into the Ghetto, but they tell Heck that, with pigs, they can help feed the German occupying forces. Heck is intrigued; he needs a home for his experiments on recreating ancient beasts as a symbol of the Reich.[Note 2] He agrees to the pig farm idea.
Jan begins retrieving garbage scraps from the Ghetto to feed the pigs; the sights he sees there, of starving Jews, is shocking and unbearable. Jan begins to work with the Underground Army, to spirit Jews from the Ghetto to safehouses in other parts of the country. He sneaks them out in his garbage truck, taking them to the zoo, where they hide in animal cages, tunnels, and inside the Zabinski house. After some trepidation, Antonina agrees to help. It's not easy for her at first, but she has a gift with frightened creatures and learns how to comfort even the most terrified people.
While trying to rescue a group of Jews, Jan discovers a young girl, Urszula (Shira Haas), being raped by two Nazi guards. Jan hides Urszula in his truck and sneaks her into the zoo. She is traumatized and refuses to speak. Antonina slowly draws her out by telling her the story of her own hard childhood, and by giving her a baby rabbit. Urszula eventually loses her fear and becomes part of the secret household of hidden Jews.
The Żabińskis continue to sneak Jews out of the Ghetto, hiding them in the zoo or disguising them as Aryans by bleaching their hair and taking them to safehouses. However, in 1942, the Germans begin deporting Jews to the death camps. Jan is devastated to see young children being put into cattle cars, to be taken to the camps. They reach for his hand, leaving him no choice but to help them into a cattle car, beneath the eyes of German police.
In 1943, two women rescued by Jan and disguised as Aryans by Antonina are arrested and executed in a Warsaw street. Several months later, after a failed uprising, the Germans announce their intention to liquidate the Ghetto. It will happen on Hitler's birthday, which also falls on the first night of Passover. While the Jews mournfully celebrate a secret Passover Seder in the zoo, the Germans burn down the Ghetto, killing any remaining Jews inside.
Several months later, Antonina has become pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl, whom Ryszard names Teresa. As Heck's attraction to Antonina deepens, and as she struggles to fend him off while still guarding their secret ""guests,"" Jan participates in the Warsaw uprising, in which he is shot in the neck and captured. Antonina worries and wishes that he will return to reunite with them.
In January 1945, with the Soviet troops forcing the Germans to retreat, the enemies begin to evacuate Warsaw. In a last attempt to find Jan, Antonina asks Heck for help, but he refuses, revealing that he once heard Ryszard say ""Hitler ist kaputt"" and accusing Antonina of resistance activity. Heck attacks Antonina in a rage of sexual aggression. She tells him that she is repulsed by him and he realizes that she never wanted him, that he had been duped by her self-protective flirtatiousness. Antonina returns to the zoo, warning her guests just in time for their escape. Magda takes baby Teresa with her as Antonina hides Ryszard in the basement, knowing Heck will come back. Heck arrives in a fury with his men, barging into the villa's basement and discovering, at last, secret drawings on the walls: yellow Stars of David and dates, and images of hidden Jewish guests drawn with animal faces. In raging retaliation, Heck chases Ryszard through the basement's lion tunnel and outside again, seizing him at gunpoint.
Antonina begs Heck not to kill Ryszard but he drags the boy away. A tense beat; a shot rings out off-screen. Antonina collapses in sobs. And then Ryszard suddenly returns, victim of a cruel hoax. Lutz Heck leaves the zoo for good, and Antonina and Ryszard join the long march out of Warsaw, taking with them the rabbit and one of Heck's test subjects, a young bison. As they leave their home and the city is liberated, they release the bison into the woods.
Four months after the Nazi surrender, Warsaw begins to be rebuilt. Antonina, Ryszard and baby Teresa return. The zoo is terribly damaged but still standing. Jerzyk, their loyal zookeeper, is there to greet them. Spring comes as they begin to rebuild, and with them, Urszula, Magda, and Maurycy. As birds return and life resumes, Antonina looks up to see Jan walking home, a survivor of a prison camp. Antonina runs into his arms.
In the film's final moment, the Żabińskis paint Stars of David on all the cages in the zoo.
The Postscript tells us that 300 people were saved by the Zabinskis in their zoo. Lutz Heck returned to Berlin, where his zoo was destroyed by Allied bombings. His efforts to recreate extinct aurochs failed. The Żabińskis were eventually recognized by Yad V'shem for their righteous acts and defiance against the Germans.[9] The Zabinskis rebuilt their zoo and the Warsaw Zoo remains open to this day."
The Blackcoat's Daughter,"In February, at a prestigious Catholic boarding school in upstate New York, students are preparing to be picked up by their parents for break. Kat (Kiernan Shipka), a freshman, has a dream where her father shows her the horribly smashed family car. She awakens from the dream, and marks off her calendar, looking forward to the day her parents will come. An older student, Rose (Lucy Boynton), worries she might be pregnant and intends to tell her boyfriend that night.
When both Kat and Rose's parents fail to pick them up before break, Rose confesses she told them the wrong date but doesn't disclose it's because she wants to delay them until she can tell her boyfriend about the pregnancy. Mr. Gordon, the headmaster, jokes that their parents will eventually show up since they can't live there forever. Kat is visibly upset, and the two nuns who are acting as chaperones reassure her that everything's fine and promise to keep calling her parents. They ask Rose to watch over Kat that night.
That night Rose tells Kat that she's going out. When Kat protests, Rose tries to unnerve her by telling her a story about the nuns at the school being devil-worshipers. She leaves Kat alone and gets in the car with her boyfriend. Kat hears a payphone ringing in the hall and picks up.
Meanwhile, a girl named Joan (Emma Roberts) gets off a bus in upstate New York and cleans herself up in the bus station bathroom. She has a flashback of a psych ward and tears a hospital bracelet off her wrist. She attempts to make a call on a payphone but the number she calls has been disconnected. As she waits outside for the next bus, she's noticed by a man named Bill (James Remar) who offers her a ride, much to the chagrin of his wife, Linda (Lauren Holly). Joan notices a bouquet of flowers in the backseat.
Once dropped back to the school by her boyfriend, Rose goes to the bathroom and hears strange noises coming from the boiler room and goes to investigate. When she looks through a window in the door she sees Kat prostrating in front of the lit boiler.
Joan awakens in a hotel room. She takes a shower and a bullet scar can be seen on her shoulder. In a flashback, a police officer shoots a rifle. Bill knocks and tells Joan the reason he picked her up is because she reminds him of someone. He invites her to have dinner with him at the restaurant next door, where he shows Joan a picture of Rose, who is revealed to be his daughter. He explains she died nine years ago. Joan excuses herself and goes to the bathroom where she giggles and has a memory of killing a woman and stealing her identification card. Joan sees Bill talking to a cop and steals a knife from a bus tray. Bill tells her they have to hit the road to beat an impending storm and Joan goes to the car where Linda is waiting. Linda tells Joan that Bill sees Rose in every young girl but that she doesn't see Rose in Joan at all.
Rose tucks Kat in and tries to reassure her that her parents are on their way. Kat tells Rose she knows her parents are dead, which disturbs Rose. Rose goes back to her room and bars her door with a chair. Rose awakens and goes to breakfast with the two chaperones and Kat. Kat begins to act strangely and is unable to pray. When one of the chaperones begins to scold her, Kat stands up and vomits. As they try to nurse her, she lashes out at them. Mr. Gordon rings to tell them he will be coming back to the school. It is implied that Kat's parents have indeed died in a car crash. The women ask Rose to shovel the driveway for him. After shoveling, Rose tries to re-enter the chaperones' house but the doors are locked, so she returns to her dorm room.
When Mr. Gordon arrives at the house, he is accompanied by a police officer. Upon entering the house, Mr. Gordon grasps his face in horror. In a flashback, Kat is seen answering the payphone and hears a gravely voice on the other end, which she calls ""Dad."" It tells her that her parents aren't coming, and to kill everyone. Later, Kat is seen stabbing the two chaperones to death. While one of the victims crawls along the floor, mortally wounded, Kat casually walks upstairs and returns with two pillowcases. She then finishes the job. Rose goes to the bathroom and gets her period, sighing in relief. She hears someone enter the bathroom but then leave. When she goes to the dorm stairwell she sees two bloody heads wrapped in pillowcases and hurries back to the hall. Kat appears and stabs Rose to death before decapitating her.
The police officer finds Kat in the boiler room, kneeling in front of the lit boiler and surrounded by the heads of her three victims. She stands and begins to yell ""Hail Satan!"" When she fails to drop the knife, the cop shoots her in the shoulder.
Joan is in the car with Bill and Linda. Linda reveals to Joan that Rose was brutally murdered nine years earlier and decapitated. Joan says she's going to be sick and Bill pulls over. Joan then slashes Bill's throat and stabs Linda to death. She cuts off their heads and puts them in a suitcase which she carries to the boarding school, now all boarded up.
Father Brien visits Kat, now revealed to be a younger ""Joan"", in the psych ward and performs an exorcism. Kat sees a shadowed, demonic figure; she asks it to stay with her, but it disappears. In present day, Joan enters the boiler room with the suitcase only to find the boiler dark and cold. She exits the school and looks back at it as she begins to sob, realizing she is truly alone."
The Discovery,"The film opens with an interview with Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford), the man who scientifically proved the existence of an afterlife, which has led to an extremely high suicide rate. The interviewer (Mary Steenburgen) asks Harbor if he feels responsible, to which he says no. Directly after, a member of the crew kills himself on air.
On the two year anniversary of the discovery, Harbor's son Will (Jason Segel) travels on a ferry where he meets Isla (Rooney Mara). They have a conversation and Will notes Isla looks very familiar. He says he is upset that people keep killing themselves, while Isla thinks it's an easy way out. Will also shares a memory he had while being dead for a minute, where he saw a young boy at a beach.
Will is picked up by his brother Toby (Jesse Plemons), who drives him to an isolated mansion where their father has built up his new station. Will notes people working for him, and Toby says they all attempted suicide. They enter a room where Will meets Lacey (Riley Keough) and Cooper (Ron Canada), and sees his father tied up to a machine as they kill and revive him. Will blames him for the high suicide rate.
Later, Will sees Isla on the beach as she walks into the water with a backpack loaded down by a gym weight. He runs after, barely saving her. He brings her to the mansion, where she is taken in. At a later meeting with the occupants, Thomas reveals he invented a machine that can record what dead people see in the afterlife, which requires a dead person, and they steal the corpse of Pat Phillips (Paul Bellefeuille) from the morgue.
Will reveals to Isla that his mother killed herself when he was younger. The next day, they try to record the afterlife but nothing happens. After the failed attempt, Will enters the room alone and puts back a piece of wiring he took out of the machine, which then shows a sequence of Pat Phillips driving to a hospital, visiting someone and fighting with a woman there. Will finds the hospital from the recording online and visits it, but finds that the hallway from the video is gone after remodeling a decade prior.
Later, during a meeting, Thomas brings Lacey on stage and confronts her about telling other people in the mansion about the failed device and tells her to leave immediately. Will drives Isla to the hospital and shows her the recording and tells her that he thinks the device records memory rather than the afterlife. After breaking into the hospital, they find a file from Pat Phillips' father, who died in the hospital.
Isla finds out that the man in the recording has a different tattoo from the one she saw on Pat earlier. Will drives her to the beach, where she reveals to him that she had a son and that he died while she was asleep. Later they seek out the woman from the video, revealed to be Pat's sister Janice (M.J. Karmi). She tells them that Pat left her alone with their dying father and that he never visited him in the hospital.
Isla and Will grow closer together and share a kiss, which is interrupted by Toby. Together they rush to Thomas, who is hooked up on the machine and dead. They observe that he is seeing the night their mother killed herself, except that Thomas stops her. They are able to revive Thomas, who concludes that the afterlife is an alternate version of their existing life, only with different choices made. They agree to destroy the machine, as this revelation would provoke millions of suicides by people wanting to improve the lives they have. Thomas prepares to hold a speech, which is interrupted by Lacey shooting Isla, claiming she has just ""relocated"" her. Isla dies in Will's arms.
Later, a devastated Will hooks himself up with the machine. He arrives back on the ferry, where he meets Isla again, who states that this is a memory. It is revealed that Will is living in a memory loop trying to prevent Isla's death and that he restarts on the ferry every time. Isla says that he saved her and that they both will move on now. Although Toby and Thomas try to revive Will, he dies, promising Isla to remember her.
Will stands on the beach, where he sees a little boy and gets him out of the water. The little boy's mother, Isla, arrives and thanks Will. They don't recognize each other. After she leaves, he walks away, but starting to recall who Isla is, he slowly stops and looks back."

Smurfs: The Lost Village,"In Smurf Village, the Smurfs live peacefully among themselves and their leader is Papa Smurf. Some of the Smurfs include Clumsy Smurf, Brainy Smurf, Hefty Smurf and Smurfette, who was created by Gargamel from a lump of clay, but redeemed by Papa Smurf and became part of the village. Gargamel makes it his mission to capture the Smurfs, steal all of their essence, and become the most powerful wizard in the world.
After Smurfette accidentally breaks an invention by Brainy, she sees a blue creature hidden by a leaf and follows it straight into the Forbidden Forest, believing the creature to be a Smurf. She loses sight of the creature but discovers a hat was dropped by the possible Smurf. Smurfette ends up being captured by Gargamel and at his castle, she ends up inadvertently revealing the hat, enabling Gargamel to mix up a brew that causes him to locate the village on a map. Soon enough Hefty, Brainy, and Clumsy help Smurfette escape and return to Smurf Village, where Papa Smurf punishes them for disobeying his orders and confines them to their houses while dismissing their claims of a lost village filled with Smurfs.
Smurfette sneaks out into the night to look for the lost village, however, and Brainy, Clumsy, and Hefty volunteer to come with her. Smurfette agrees to let them join her and together the four enter the Forbidden Forest. Gargamel soon discovers them trying to find the lost village and heads out with Azrael and Monty to stop them.
The four follow the map and end up in various adventures, all while encountering bizarre creatures; the four encounter a colony of fire-breathing dragonflies, where Gargamel follows them and tries to have them killed by having the dragonflies attack them. Smurfette, Brainy, Hefty and Clumsy survive, but then end up getting lost in a maze of caverns, where they eventually get out thanks to a stampede of glow-in-the-dark rabbits. The four then head off to a river and sail on a handmade raft along the river to get to the lost village, but then they encounter Gargamel, Azrael, and Monty again. Following a brief chase, Gargamel is thrown out of his own raft, so Hefty and Smurfette convince the others to help save him. They do so, but instead of thanking them, he pushes them out of their raft, leaving them to plunge down a waterfall.
Meanwhile, back at Smurf Village, Papa Smurf tries to reconcile with Smurfette over his actions on the previous night but soon discovers she, Brainy, Hefty, and Clumsy are gone, so he sets out to find them and set things right with them. The four are soon captured by the leaf-covered creature along with a few others who reveal themselves to be female Smurfs. They are taken to Smurfy Grove where they meet Smurf Willow, Smurf Storm, Smurf Blossom, Smurf Lily and Smurf Melody, who all welcome the Smurfs to their humble home. Smurf Storm and Clumsy head away from the village to locate Gargamel and alert the others. During the trip, Clumsy reveals that Smurfette was created by Gargamel, which causes Smurf Storm to distrust Smurfette. Gargamel, who was led into a piranha-infested swamp, spots Clumsy and Smurf Storm, and has Monty attack them, but they fly away to return to the village.
After a while of showing them what they do, Smurf Storm and Clumsy come back with her telling Smurfette was created by Gargamel. The female Smurfs prepare an attack that night but instead of Gargamel, Papa Smurf appears, and the female Smurfs accept him into their home. Soon, Gargamel comes and destroys Smurfy Grove, capturing all the Smurfs, with the exception of Smurfette, who is now alone, feeling heartbroken for her actions. However, Snappy shows her a picture of her and the others, and realizing she is not a real Smurf, heads back to Gargamel's lair to save the Smurfs.
At Gargamel's lair, Brainy makes a plan to escape. Papa Smurf hears their plan and he and Smurf Willow decide to help them. Hefty, Brainy, Clumsy, and some of the female Smurfs succeed at the plan until Gargamel and Azrael spot them and put some of the female Smurfs and Clumsy into his Smurfilator, a machine capable of extracting their essence. Smurfette appears, tricking Gargamel into believing she wants to be an evil smurf again. When Gargamel tries to turn Smurfette into an evil smurf, he realizes Smurfette is absorbing his magic powers instead. Gargamel, Azrael, and Monty are sent flying back into the piranha-infested lake. The Smurfs are freed but despite their victory, Smurfette has reverted back to a lifeless lump of clay.
Back at Smurf Village, the Smurfs make a memorial for Smurfette. Their energy and love for Smurfette revives her, and everybody happily celebrates. Smurf Village and Smurfy Grove rejoice in their new unity; in the end, Smurfette finally finds her purpose and most of all, a true-blue Smurf.
During the end credits, Gargamel, Azrael, and Monty are walking back to their castle with Gargamel feeling angry in his failure to kill the Smurfs."
Going in Style,"Joe, Willie, and Albert are senior citizens and lifelong friends living in New York. During an unpleasant appointment at the bank, Joe is one of the victims to witness a robbery in progress carried out by three individuals wearing black masks. During the robbery, he notices the leader bearing a Mongol warrior tattoo on his neck as the only lead that could help the police identify the culprit. However, the leader sympathizes with Joe when he finds out about his current financial situation brought up by the bank. Then, the robbers manage to escape with over $1.6 million.
When the company they worked for is bought out, their pensions become a casualty of the restructuring. Joe is hit particularly hard and finds out that he, his daughter, Rachel, and granddaughter, Brooklyn, will be homeless in fewer than 30 days. Willie finds out he's gravely ill from kidney failure and needs a transplant and is even more frustrated because his financial situation forces him into a long-distance relationship with his daughter and granddaughter. Desperate, the three friends decide to rob the bank that is going to restructure their pension funds and take back what is rightfully theirs.
Inspired by his experience of the robbery, Joe originates the idea; at first Albert and Willie are appalled, but eventually agree when they later learn that their bank intends to steal their pensions. Trying to shoplift some items from a grocery store, where Al's love interest, Annie, works, results in a comic disaster, so the trio turn to Joe's former son-in-law, Murphy, and a criminal working as a pet store owner named Jesus to teach them the ropes. They plan an alibi using their lodge's carnival as a cover.
Joe, Willie, and Albert disguise themselves as ""The Rat Pack"" (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis, Jr.) and use guns with blanks so that no one gets hurt. The robbery almost goes awry when Willie collapses briefly and a child witness partially pulls off his mask to allow him to breathe better; she sees the wrist watch he wears with a picture of his granddaughter on it as he engages in a friendly conversation and sympathizes with her, so as not to let her feel intimidated about the robbery in progress and when the bank manager clumsily tries to fire shots at them; however, the three manage to get away with over $2.3 million. They are soon arrested on suspicion by FBI Agent Hamer after the manager from the grocery store recognizes Al's walk from the video surveillance cameras, but they all stick to their alibis.
Hamer puts them along with other senior suspects into a police lineup, using the child witness who partially took off Willie's mask. She refuses to identify Willie, leaving Hamer with no case. Willie suffers total renal failure and is near death until Al agrees to donate a kidney. While part of the money is used to help the three friends with their financial situations, the rest is given to their families, friends, co-workers, and fellow members at the lodge. Joe finally gets his granddaughter a puppy he promised her if she got A's in every subject at school; courtesy of Jesus, who is later revealed to be the leader of the robbers from the robbery Joe witnessed and has laundered the money that they stole. The tattoo on his neck is also revealed to be a fake made of henna, intended to throw the FBI and the police off the scent. The movie ends at Al and Annie's wedding as the three friends celebrate their good fortune."
Colossal,"Gloria is an unemployed writer struggling with alcoholism. Her errant behavior prompts her frustrated boyfriend Tim to break up with her and evict her from their New York City apartment. Forced to move back to her hometown in New England (the fictional Mainhead), Gloria reunites with her childhood friend Oscar, who now runs his late father's bar. Oscar is warm and welcoming to Gloria; he brings her an old television set for her unfurnished house and offers her a job at the bar to help her, which Gloria accepts.
Working at the bar aggravates Gloria's alcohol problem. Each shift, she hangs out and drinks until morning with Oscar and his friends, Garth and Joel, while sleeping it off on a bench near a children's playground. At the same time, a giant reptilian monster appears in Seoul, leaving death and destruction in its wake. Gradually, Gloria realizes that when she walks through the playground at exactly 8:05 am, she causes the monster to manifest and the creature's movements correspond with her own.
Gloria reveals her secret to Oscar and his friends; however, when Oscar steps onto the playground, he causes a giant robot to appear in Seoul. Gloria ultimately tries to make amends by having the monster spell out an apology in Korean, to the delight of the South Koreans and the media, and begins to avoid both the playground and alcohol.
After spending the night with Joel, Gloria discovers that a drunken Oscar is using the robot to taunt South Korea. After a tense confrontation, Gloria manages to make him leave. Oscar is jealous, believing that something happened between Gloria and Joel. Later that night at the bar, he drunkenly insults his friends and demands that Gloria drinks, then orders her to do so by threatening to return to the playground if she does not. The next morning, a sobered-up Oscar confesses his remorse and pleads with Gloria to forgive him. Gloria accepts his apology, but Oscar's controlling attitude becomes clear.
Tim shows up in town on a pretense in order to see Gloria. Oscar provokes a confrontation that ends with him setting off a large firework inside the bar. He follows this up by boasting that, no matter how he behaves, he knows that Gloria will remain under his thumb. He later shows up at Gloria's house, telling her he is there to prevent her from going back to New York with Tim.
A flashback reveals how Gloria and Oscar are able to manifest their avatars in South Korea: a freak lightning flash struck both of them, a toy robot and a toy reptilian monster while they were passing through the playground when they were children. Gloria also realizes that Oscar has always been violent and manipulative because he hates himself, and resolves to leave town with Tim. Oscar, in response, heads for the playground. When Gloria follows, Oscar assaults her, leaving her on the ground while he terrorizes Seoul.
Upon returning to her house, Gloria comes up with a plan to stop Oscar. She flies to South Korea, apologizing to Tim for not coming with him. Once again at 8:05 am, U.S. time, Oscar causes the giant robot to manifest in Seoul. As she heads towards Oscar's avatar, Gloria causes her monster to appear again, this time at the playground back home. Clutching Oscar in her hand, Gloria's monster throws Oscar off into the distance, causing the giant robot to be launched into the sky, disappearing from Seoul.
Her mission accomplished, Gloria retreats to an empty bar in Seoul. Settling into her seat, Gloria promises the young waitress an incredible story. Offered a drink, Gloria simply lets out a long sigh."
Gifted,"In a small town near Tampa, Florida, seven-year-old Mary Adler lives with uncle and de facto guardian, Frank. Her best friend is her 40-ish neighbor, Roberta. On her first day of first grade, she shows remarkable mathematical talent, which impresses her teacher, Bonnie Stevenson. There, despite her initial disdain for average children her own age and her boredom with their classwork, she begins to bond with them when she brings her one-eyed cat, Fred, for show-and-tell and later defends a classmate from a bully on the bus. Mary is offered a scholarship to a private school for gifted children. However, Frank turns it down. Based on his family's experiences with similar schools, he fears Mary will not have a chance at a ""normal"" childhood.
It emerges that Mary's mother, Diane, had been a promising mathematician, dedicated to the Navier–Stokes problem (one of the unsolved Millennium Prize Problems) before taking her own life when Mary was six months old. Mary has lived with Frank, a former college professor turned boat repairman, ever since.
Frank's estranged mother and Mary's maternal grandmother, Evelyn, seeks to gain custody of Mary and move her to Massachusetts, believing that Mary is a ""one-in-a-billion"" mathematical prodigy who should be specially tutored in preparation for a life devoted to mathematics, much as Diane was. However, Frank is adamant that his sister would want Mary to be in a normal public school and have the childhood she didn't have. Worried that the judge will rule against him and he will lose Mary completely, Frank accepts a compromise brokered by his lawyer Greg Cullen that sees Mary placed in foster care and attend the private school where Evelyn wants to have her enrolled. The foster parents live just 25 minutes from Frank's home, Frank will be entitled to scheduled visits, and Mary will be able to decide where she wants to live after her 12th birthday.
Mary is devastated at being placed in foster care, and her foster father says she refuses to see Frank. When Bonnie sees a picture of Fred up for adoption, she alerts Frank. Frank retrieves the cat from the pound and, learning that Fred was brought in due to allergy issues, realizes that Evelyn—who is allergic to cats—is overseeing Mary's education in the guest house of Mary's foster home. He then reveals to Evelyn—who had been a mathematician herself—that Diane had solved the Navier–Stokes problem, but stipulated that the solution was to be withheld until Evelyn's death. Knowing that it meant everything to Evelyn to see Diane solve the problem, Frank offers to publish Diane's work if Evelyn drops her objection to him having custody of Mary. Evelyn reluctantly agrees.
The film ends with Mary back in the custody of Frank, returning to public school while taking college-level courses in the mornings."
Aftermath,"Roman Melnyk, a construction worker, is allowed to leave work early, for the arrival of his wife and pregnant daughter, Olena and Nadiya, from New York City aboard AX 112. At the airport to welcome his family, Roman receives the news that AX 112, with his wife and daughter onboard, had been in an accident. From this point, Roman is devastated and blames the air traffic controller for the deaths of his family.
Meanwhile, in another angle of the story, Jacob ""Jake"" Bonanos, an air traffic controller, is happily married to a woman named Christina with whom he has a young son named Samuel. Jake is now also devastated, after seeing AX 112 and the other flight, DH 616, disappear from the radar, showing that the two planes collided and were destroyed. Although the investigators cannot hold Jake responsible for the deaths of the passengers, he blames himself. However, as time passes, he slowly unravels, straining the relationship with his family, and is unwilling to talk about what happened.
It is reported that all 271 passengers and crew were killed in the mid-air collision. Roman goes to the crash site and, posing as a normal volunteer, he recovers his daughter's necklace and the bodies of his wife and daughter. At his home, Roman stays hidden inside, when Tessa Gorbett, a journalist, approaches, expressing interest in writing a book on the incident. She ends up leaving behind some prior articles of plane disasters she had written about (to show her credentials as a serious journalist) through the mail slot of the door.
Because of the seriousness of the incident, the lawyer advises Jake to move to another state and adopt a new name for the safety of himself and of his family. Roman meets lawyers John and James Gullick to sign an agreement stating that the airport companies will pay for the expenses and damages to his family. Roman refuses to sign it as neither the company nor the lawyers express apologies for the loss of his family.
One year later, Roman and the families of the crash victims attend an inauguration of the newly completed memorial at the crash site. Jake, having moved to another site, now works at a travel agency, under the name ""Pat Dealbert"" and lives alone. Roman has also moved on to another town and now works as a carpenter. Roman meets Tessa and asks her, as a favor, to find Jake. Tessa later reveals Jake's cover name and occupation but she initially refuses to give his address. Roman tracks down the building where Jake is working and follows him to his apartment. There, after waiting a day, on a day when Christina and Samuel happen to be visiting Jake for the weekend, Roman confronts him at his door. Jake refuses to offer an apology, so Roman stabs Jake in the neck. Jake falls to the floor and bleeds to death while Christina and Samuel sob uncontrollably.
Roman is convicted of murder and serves a 10-year prison term, then is released on four months' parole. He visits his family's grave where he meets a stranger. The stranger turns out to be a now-grown Samuel, who has tracked Roman down with the intention of killing him to avenge his father's murder. However, Samuel cannot bring himself to kill Roman since it's not what he was taught. Samuel accepts Roman's apology and allows him to leave."
The Fate of the Furious,"Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto and Letty Ortiz are on their honeymoon in Havana when Dom's cousin Fernando gets in trouble owing money to local racer Raldo. Sensing Raldo is a loan shark, Dom challenges Raldo to a race, pitting Fernando's reworked car against Raldo's, and wagering his own show car. After narrowly winning the race, Dom allows Raldo to keep his car, earning his respect, and instead leaves his cousin with his show car.
The next day, Dom is approached by the elusive cyberterrorist Cipher who coerces him into working for her. Shortly afterwards, Dom and his team, comprising Letty, Roman Pearce, Tej Parker, and Ramsey, are recruited by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs to help him retrieve an EMP device from a military outpost in Berlin. During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison he helped imprison Deckard Shaw in. After escaping, Deckard and Hobbs are recruited by intelligence operative Mr. Nobody and his protégé to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Deckard reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen Shaw to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as the latter two attack the base and steal God's Eye. When Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has been holding hostage Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves—as well as their son, of whose existence Dom was previously unaware. Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos.
In New York City, Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a nuclear football held by the Russian Minister of Defence. Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher and persuades Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to drive automatically and taking out the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom.
Dom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a nuclear submarine, enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Deckard, whose death was apparently faked, teams up with Owen, and under Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher fires an infrared homing missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion. When Deckard reaches the front of the plane and confronts a defeated Cipher, she makes her escape by parachuting out of the plane.
Mr. Nobody and his protégé visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large in Athens. Hobbs is offered his DSS job back, but he declines in order to spend more time with his daughter. Deckard delivers Dom his son, putting his differences aside with Dom and Hobbs. Dom names his son Brian, after his friend and brother-in-law Brian O'Conner, and they celebrate."
Spark,"Thirteen years ago, the evil primate General Zhong overthrew his noble brother to seize the throne of the planet Bana, using a spacetime anomaly known as a ""slick"", which has the ability to create black holes; slicks were made by a wild creature known as a space kraken. The black hole created from the slick partially destroyed Bana, and swallowed up many subjects. Among the few survivors were a baby monkey named Spark, a warrior fox named Vix, and a pig mechanic named Chunk.
In the present, Spark, Vix, Chunk and Spark's forgetful nanny bot, Bananny, secretly live on a shard used as a garbage dump, with Vix and Chunk leading insurgency missions against Zhong, although they constantly forbid Spark from coming along. One day, Spark intercepts an e-mail sent to Vix about a new mission, and decides to take the mission himself without her knowing. The e-mail leads to the Queen of Bana, whom Zhong still permits to live in the palace. After Spark infiltrates the palace and meets the Queen, she hands him a kraken-finder, which Zhong wants to use to find and recapture the space kraken in order to destroy another planet. Spark decides to use it to find the kraken himself; he tames the creature and brings it back to the garbage shard. But he then finds his home raided by Zhong's forces, who then capture both him and the kraken. Zhong forces the kraken to make a new slick into which he hurls Spark, Vix, Chunk and the entire garbage shard.
The trio discover that the slick is actually a wormhole that leads to a desert planet. Vix and Chunk get upset at Spark for causing Zhong to obtain the kraken, and then split up. Spark finds survivors of the first slick, living in the King's old flagship battle cruiser. The Captain of the flagship reveals that Spark is in fact the son of the King and Queen, who entrusted Vix and Chunk to hide and protect him. He also reveals that the King had actually died in an accident some years ago, but Spark has a vision of the King when he visits a memorial to him, and finds a special weapon made for the royal family. Spark then learns from the deceased King that his friends have been captured by giant mutated roaches. Spark, with the help of his father's spirit and his roach friend, Floyd, defeats the mutated roaches and rescues Vix and Chunk. Spark rallies Vix, Chunk, the Captain and his survivors to mount an attack on Zhong, and Chunk figures out a way to use technology to make a slick of their own. In the meantime, Zhong uses the space kraken to intimidate the rest of the galaxy.
The flagship and survivors return to Bana through their own slick, and ultimately defeat Zhong's forces after a prolonged battle. Spark personally rescues the queen from Zhong's own flagship, which gets critically damaged during the battle. Spark decides to rescue his ""Uncle"" Zhong as well, but the annoyed Queen then punches Zhong into the slick after he ""begs"" for forgiveness.
The film ends with Spark's friends and allies celebrating him becoming the new Prince of Bana."
The Lost City of Z,"Ireland, 1905: Percy Fawcett is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. A skilled horseman and marksman, he brings down the stag swiftly but is snubbed at the after-hunt party. A year later, Fawcett is sent to London to meet with officials of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS). The governments of Bolivia and Brazil are nearly at war over the location of their mutual boundary and its direct effect on the region's extremely lucrative rubber trade, and have asked the British government to survey it. Fawcett agrees to lead the survey party to restore his family's good name. Aboard a ship to Brazil, Fawcett meets Corporal Henry Costin, who has knowledge of the Amazon rainforest. At a large rubber plantation in the jungle owned by the Portuguese nobleman Baron de Gondoris, the two meet Corporal Arthur Manley, who tells them that the British government advises against further exploration. Fawcett, with several guides and the Amazonian scout Tadjui, completes the mission. Tadjui tells Fawcett stories about a city in the jungle covered in gold and full of people. Fawcett dismisses such stories as insane ravings, but discovers highly advanced broken pottery and some small stone statues in the jungle that convince him of the veracity of Tadjui's story.
Fawcett is praised upon his return, where his wife, Nina, has given birth to their second son. In the Trinity College Library, Nina discovers a conquistador text which tells of a city deep in the Amazonian jungle. Fawcett meets the renowned biologist James Murray, who agrees to back Fawcett's expedition to the Amazon to find what Fawcett calls ""the Lost City of Z"". Fawcett attempts to convince the members of the RGS to back the expedition, but is publicly ridiculed. Nevertheless, the RGS backs the expedition to further exploration of the Amazon basin. Murray, unfamiliar with the rigors of the deep jungle, slows the party down significantly. Fawcett's party is attacked while traveling along the river. However, Fawcett makes peace with the natives. Murray suffers a leg injury which becomes severely infected, and begins to go mad. Fawcett sends him off with a native guide and the group's last pack animal to find aid. Fawcett's team are forced to abandon the expedition after discovering that Murray poured paraffin on their remaining supplies.
Murray survives and, in front of the RGS trustees, accuses Fawcett of abandoning him in the jungle. Fawcett elects to resign from the society rather than apologize. World War I breaks out in Europe, and Fawcett goes to France to fight. Manley dies in the trenches at the Battle of the Somme, and Fawcett is temporarily blinded in a chlorine gas attack. Jack, Fawcett's eldest son—who had long accused Fawcett of abandoning the family—reconciles with his father as he recovers.
In 1923, Fawcett is living in obscurity in Britain. North American interest in exploring the Amazon has reached fever pitch, primarily due to Fawcett's stories of the lost city. John D. Rockefeller Jr. and a consortium of US newspapers finance a new expedition by Fawcett. The RGS co-funds the expedition at the last moment to maintain British pride. Fawcett shows Sir John Scott Keltie a compass, informing Keltie that should he (Fawcett) find the lost city, the compass will be sent back to Britain. Fawcett and his son intend to go alone this time, traveling as light as they can for up to three years in order to find ""Z"". Fawcett invites Costin, but he declines. Fawcett and Jack are attacked by natives and escape, only to be ambushed again. This second tribe gives the Fawcetts a fair hearing, but are puzzled by them, noticing that their spirits aren't wholly of their own world but also not wholly of the Amazon. They declare that the spirits of the Fawcetts ""must belong"" somewhere and they will help them find their rightful place. Fawcett and Jack are drugged during a ceremony and carried away.
Some years later, Nina Fawcett meets with Keltie, claiming she has heard that Fawcett and Jack are still alive and are living among tribespeople. The RGS, having sent more than a hundred people to search for Fawcett in the intervening years, declines to send another expedition. Keltie advises Nina to come to terms with her husband's death, but she refuses. Nina instead opens her purse, to give Keltie the compass Fawcett had promised to send were he to have found the lost city."
My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea,"Dash (voiced by Schwartzman) and his best friend Assaf (Watts) are sophomores at Tides High School, a school located at a cliff edge above a fault line. The friends write as a team for the school newspaper, edited by mutual friend Verti (Rudolph). But one day Verti assigns Assaf to write a story solo about the new auditorium opening in the top floor, and Dash clearly picks up a relationship forming between Assaf and Verti. Feeling angered and betrayed, Dash writes a hurtful article about Assaf that provokes Principal Grimm to put a mark on his permanent record. Dash breaks into the school archives to find his record, but discovers evidence that Grimm had forged the inspection report for the auditorium. He also runs into Mary, a junior overachiever trying to find her confiscated cell phone. Dash tries to warn the rest of the students, but gets thrown into detention along with Mary for breaking into the archives, right when the auditorium opens causing the school to break off the cliff and fall into the ocean.
Dash rescues Assaf and Verti from the sophomore level library, and Verti figures out that they can swim through the seawater by breathing trapped pockets of air. Dash nearly drowns, but is rescued by Lunch Lady Lorraine. At the junior level floor, the teachers are trying to bring surviving kids in line. It takes Lorraine to calm down a riot; she further shows her survival skills by saving Verti from a group of drug dealing students. The trio plus Lorraine and Mary decide to make it to the roof, but no one else wants to follow them. At the senior level floor, they find Brent Daniels organizing a hostile cult around him. They then find Grimm, who admits to the forgery. Grimm points out that they can scale to the roof using the back of the auditorium bleachers, and then sacrifices his life to open the bleachers up. The five friends reach the roof just as rescue helicopters arrive. Lorraine rescues a handful of other students while some others escape using a makeshift raft. Dash and Assaf vow to write a book about the disaster.
Many weeks later, the surviving students attend a party for the release of Dash and Assaf's book, ""Our Entire High School Sinking into the Sea"". Reviews of the book come out mixed to negative because of Dash's turgid prose. Lorraine notes to Dash that she has a new year's worth of students to feed and take care of, before leaving the party."

The film cuts to six months earlier, with Julia getting a sendoff from her boss and friend, Ali, from her job as chief online editor for a storytelling website. Julia is now going to work remotely from the mansion she will be sharing with her new fiancé, David Connover, and her soon-to-be stepdaughter, Lily. Arriving at David's, she is greeted by David's ex-wife, Tessa, who is still not coping with the end of her marriage two years earlier.
The next evening, Tessa shows up at the house to drop off something, but Lily insists she stays for dinner. While they are eating, Tessa openly criticizes Julia's cooking and leaves. Julia then gets a notification that her restraining order against Michael has expired, much to her distress.
Tessa is visited by her controlling mother, ""Lovey"", who is constantly belittles Tessa. Tessa puts Julia's name into an identity search engine and discovers her restraining order against Michael. She sets up a Facebook account as Julia and begins messaging Michael, telling him how much ""Julia"" misses him.
Julia receives a surprise flower delivery, sent anonymously by Tessa to make it look like Julia is having an affair. While Julia is at the door, Tessa sneaks in and steals David's watch, his grandmother's wedding ring, and a pair of Julia's panties. That afternoon, while Julia and Lily go to a farmer's market to see David's brewry booth, Lily wanders off. After a few minutes of frantic searching, she finds Lily in Tessa's arms, who is complaining to David about Julia's incompetence as a mother. When Tessa shows up at the house, Julia yells at her about trying to get back into David's life. That afternoon, the two have lunch together to try and reconcile, and Tessa reveals the reason that David left her was because she was having an affair. Tessa then mails Michael the watch and panties.
A few days later, Tessa attempts to get Lily to ride an unruly horse at her riding practice. Julia notices how scared Lily is and takes her home, much to Tessa's annoyance. That night, Tessa is seen pleasuring herself while sexting, as Julia, with Michael.
Tessa cuts Lily's long hair short for leaving riding practice early, leading to a heated argument with Julia when Tessa drops Lily off. Tessa throws herself down the stairs and pretends that Julia pushed her when David arrives a few minutes later. After taking Tessa to a hospital, David castigates Julia for treating his ex-wife so badly. When Julia calls on Ali for help, the two discover that Tessa has a child services record as a teenager for trying to kill her father when he left her mother for his secretary.
Tessa messages Michael, as Julia, saying she wants him to visit for sex. Michael enters the house when Julia is alone, and when she spurns his advances, Michael's violent tendicies emerge. A badly beaten Julia stabs him in the leg with a kitchen knife and escapes the house. Tessa, who was waiting outside, enters the house and stabs Michael in the heart.
The police release Julia (returning to the opening of the movie), stating the investigation will continue. After a tearful Julia explains her history with Michael, a disillusioned David goes to Tessa's to get Lily. He sees burned gloves in the fireplace and his grandmother's wedding ring on Tessa's finger, finally realizing that Tessa set up Julia. She knocks him out with a fireplace poker. Julia arrives and tries to call 911. Tessa finds her and the two fight, ending with Julia knocking her out. Julia rushes to revive David, but is attacked again by Tessa, now using a knife. When she sees herself in a mirror, Tessa realizes the monster she has become and impales herself on the knife Julia is now holding – begging Julia to not let Lily remember her like this.
Six months later, David and Julia are newly married and, with Lily, have moved into a new house. Julia answers the door to find Lovey, wanting to see her granddaughter. Julia looks on in horror as she hugs Lily."
The Promise,"Mikael (Oscar Isaac) is an apothecary who lives in the small Armenian village of Sirun in the southeast part of the Ottoman Empire. In order to help pay the expenses for medical school, he promises himself to the daughter of an affluent neighbor, receiving 400 gold coins as a dowry. This allows him to travel to Constantinople and attend the Imperial Medical Academy.
There, he befriends Emre, the son of a high-level Turkish official. Through his wealthy uncle, Mikael also meets Ana (Charlotte Le Bon), an Armenian woman raised in Paris, who is involved with an American reporter for the Associated Press, Chris Myers (Christian Bale). In due course, Mikael falls in love with Ana just as international tensions begin to rise with the outbreak of World War I. Mikael temporarily manages to avoid conscription in the Ottoman army through a medical student exemption with the help of Emre. But when he tries to save his uncle from imprisonment during the roundups of April 24, 1915, he is detained and sent to a prison labor camp himself.
Mikael eventually escapes the camp, returning to his village only to find the Turks have violently turned on their Armenian fellow townspeople. His parents, and particularly his mother, persuade him to marry his betrothed and seek refuge in a remote mountain cabin where she soon becomes pregnant. A difficult pregnancy leads Mikael to bring his wife back to the care of his mother in the village. There he learns that Ana and Christopher are at a nearby Red Cross facility and he goes to seek their help for his family to escape the imminent Turkish threat.
Departing the mission with a group of orphans, they head back to Sirun to retrieve Mikael's family. Along the way, however, they encounter a site of a massacre, as it becomes clear all of Sirun's inhabitants, including Mikael's family, save his mother, have been killed by Turkish troops. Chris is captured by Ottoman troops and sent back to Constantinople, charged with being a spy and slated for execution by the authorities; with the help of Emre, and through the intercession of American Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Chris is released and allowed to depart for Malta. Once there, he boards the French cruiser Guichen, as it prepares to set sail along the Ottoman coast. Emre's role in helping to save Chris is discovered and he is executed by a firing squad.
Escaping pursuit, Mikael, Ana, and the orphans join a large group of refugees determined to fight off the Ottoman army on mount Musa Dagh. As they fend off repeated assaults, Mikael's mother succumbs to her wounds and is buried on the mountain. The refugees hold on long enough to escape on the back side to the coast as the Guichen comes to their rescue. But as the launches return to the ship, a Turkish artillery barrage throws Ana and Yeva, the young daughter of Mikael's uncle, overboard. Mikael jumps in after them and is able to rescue Yeva, but Ana drowns.
In a voice over, Mikael recounts that he adopted Yeva and together they settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. During Yeva's wedding reception in 1942, with the Armenian orphans who have now grown up in attendance, Mikael presides over a toast, wishing good fortune to their families and the generations to come."
The Circle,"When her car breaks down, Mae Holland contacts an old acquaintance, Mercer, who is liked by her parents: Vinnie has multiple sclerosis and needs the help of his wife, Bonnie.
Mae's friend Annie Allerton works at The Circle, a tech company where Mae gets a job in Customer Experience. At a company meeting, Eamon Bailey (The Circle's CEO) introduces SeeChange, which uses small cameras placed anywhere to provide real-time video. At work, Mae rises in The Circle, embracing social networking. At a further company presentation emphasizing the need for accountability in politics, The Circle's Chief Operating Officer (COO), Tom Stenton, introduces a political candidate who has agreed to open her daily workings to the public through Circle.
Mae again sees a man from the party, Ty Lafitte. He takes her to an area where he says that all information on everyone is to be kept. Mae becomes embarrassed, as Ty is the creator of True You, a popular Circle product, and she had not recognised him. He tells her that True You has become something he did not intend. Mae is shown a picture of a light fitting, made by Mercer, in the shape of (or from) deer antlers. She photographs it and shares it on her Circle profile. The image attracts significant negative attention to Mercer, with people accusing him of killing real animals. Distressed by Mercer’s reaction to this, Mae goes kayaking at night and the rough waters cause her kayak to capsize, requiring rescue by the Coast Guard. The next day, Eamon says that SeeChange cameras recorded her at the kayak premises and in the water, which is how the Coast Guard was able to save her. At the next meeting, Eamon introduces Mae to the crowd and they discuss her experience of the rescue. The kayaking experience moves her to become the first circler to go ""completely transparent”, which involves wearing a small camera and exposing her life to the world 24/7. Mae's transparency damages her relationships, as she accidentally sees her parents having sex and they become distant from her soon after.
At a board meeting, Eamon announces support from all 50 states for voting through Circle accounts. Mae takes it a step further and suggests requiring every individual to have a Circle account, which they can then use to vote. Eamon and Tom approve, but the suggestion upsets Annie. At the next company-wide meeting, Mae says that The Circle believes it can find anyone on the planet in under 20 minutes and introduces a program to find wanted felons in the same time frame. The program identifies an escaped prisoner within 10 minutes, which causes the Circlers in the audience to erupt in applause. Mae uses this successful test to suggest transparency can be a force for good.
Mae says that the program can find anyone, not just wanted felons, and someone suggests Mercer. Mae is initially hesitant to use the program to locate Mercer, but Tom persuades Mae to continue, asking if they can break their record of 10 minutes. Mercer is quickly located in an isolated cabin where he works on his antler projects. Startled by this, he flees from the cameras to his truck and proceeds to lead those tracking him on a car chase. Not long into the escape attempt, Mercer loses control of his truck and drives off a bridge to his death, which horrifies Mae. She is seen in bed, three days later, still mourning the loss of Mercer. She calls Annie, who has also left The Circle, to her apparent benefit. Mae, however, finds that connection with others helps her cope with Mercer's death. Mae returns to the Circle, despite her parents' pleas. Mae calls Ty to ask for a favor, and Ty tells her something that he has discovered. At the next company-wide meeting, Mae explains how connection has helped her recover. She speaks with Eamon, and invites Tom onstage, then invites both Eamon and Tom to go fully transparent. She explains that Ty has found all their accounts, even the accounts that their wives were unaware of, and exposes them to the world, as no one should be exempt. Eamon and Tom, clearly upset, try to save face before Tom leaves the stage.
Mae reiterates her point of transparency being good, with the support of the audience. Mae goes kayaking again, untroubled by the drones that surround her."

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"In 2014, Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Baby Groot are renowned as the Guardians of the Galaxy. Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign race, has the Guardians protect valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister Nebula, who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After Rocket steals some for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. These are destroyed by a mysterious figure, and the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. There, this figure reveals himself as Quill's father, Ego, and invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard Nebula.
Ayesha hires Yondu Udonta and his crew, who have been exiled from the greater Ravager community for child trafficking, to recapture the Guardians. They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant Taserface leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard the latter's ship and executes his loyalists by releasing them into space. Nebula leaves to find and kill Gamora, whom she blames for the torture inflicted on her by their father: Thanos. While imprisoned, Rocket and Yondu bond. Groot and Kraglin, a remaining Yondu loyalist, free Rocket and Yondu, and they destroy the ship and its crew as they escape, though not before Taserface warns the Sovereign before getting killed himself.
Ego, a god-like Celestial that manipulated the matter around its consciousness to form this ""home"" planet, explains that it projected a humanoid guise to travel the universe and discover a purpose, eventually falling in love with Quill's mother Meredith. Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds which can terraform them into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he gave Meredith the tumour that killed her due to the distraction she posed.
Mantis, Ego's naïve empath servant, grows close to Drax and warns him of Ego's plan. Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan as Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive. As they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones, the reunited Guardians find Ego's brain at the planet's core. Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial powers to distract him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb then explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet. Yondu then sacrifices himself to save Quill, who realizes that the reason Yondu kept him was to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny, and that Yondu was Quill's true ""daddy"". Having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos by herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which is attended by Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships, acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,"Mordred, an iron-fisted warlock, and his armies lay siege to Camelot, seeking to establish the dominance of magic-wielding mages over humankind. Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, infiltrates Mordred's lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uther's treacherous younger brother Vortigern, who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to moat hags to become a demon knight, who kills Uther's wife and slays him in combat. The only survivor is Uther's son, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in Londinium, where he is found and raised by prostitutes.
Arthur grows into a skilled fighter and man of the streets. Arthur and his friends confront a group of Vikings who had mistreated one of the prostitutes, forcing him to pay her restitution. Afterwards, the brothel is raided by the Blacklegs, Vortigern's minions, and Arthur learns that the Vikings were under the king's protection. Arthur tries to escape the city but is caught and put on a ship with hundreds of other men; the Blacklegs have been forcing all men of Arthur's age to try to pull a sword that has appeared near the castle from the surrounding stone. Arthur is able to remove the sword but is quickly overwhelmed by its power and passes out. Vortigern meets with him in the dungeon, revealing his true lineage.
Meanwhile, a mage identifying herself as an acolyte of Merlin presents herself to Uther's former general, Sir Bedivere. At Arthur's planned execution, the mage uses her magic to stage a diversion while Bedivere's men rescue Arthur. Taken to Bedivere's hideout, Arthur initially refuses to help them. The mage persuades Bedivere to take Arthur to a realm called the ""Darklands,"" where he's given a vision of how Uther sacrificed himself to save Arthur and entomb the sword in stone. Arthur learns Vortigern was responsible for persuading Mordred to rebel against humanity, and he returns determined to destroy Vortigern.
With his friends and Bedivere's men, Arthur stages a series of ambushes against Vortigern, culminating in an assassination attempt in Londinium. The rebels sense a trap but attack anyway, fleeing to a fighters' school run by Arthur's mentor George, where they are overrun by the Blacklegs. Seeing the mage held at knifepoint, Arthur unleashes Excalibur's potential, single-handedly killing all of the soldiers. The rebels are able to escape the city except for Arthur's injured friend Back Lack, who is killed at Vortigern's hand in front of his son Blue.
Ashamed of his failures, Arthur tries to throw away the sword, but the Lady of the Lake returns it and shows him a vision of England's future under Vortigern's rule. Coming to terms with his responsibility, Arthur reunites with Bedivere. When they return to the rebel hideout, however, they discover all of their allies dead, Vortigern having found them and delivered an ultimatum: if Arthur does not surrender himself, the captured mage and Blue will die. Arthur surrenders himself, but as Vortigern is about to execute his nephew, a giant snake summoned by the mage attacks and devours Vortigern's men. While Bedivere and the others lead an attack on the castle, a desperate Vortigern sacrifices his only daughter and is transformed into the demon knight, confronting Arthur in a separate dimension. Despite his fighting skill, Arthur is beaten, and he is about to submit when he witnesses a vision of his father, convincing him to accept the sword and his character as his own. Arthur violently slays Vortigern but blesses him as he dies.
In the aftermath, Arthur dissolves Vortigern's pact with the Vikings and begins building a Round Table where his knighted friends will meet. Blue and the prostitutes arrive with the crown of Uther, which Arthur accepts, holding the sword aloft."
Snatched,"Recently fired from her job and dumped by her rock musician boyfriend, Emily Middleton is determined to enjoy a previously planned nonrefundable trip to Ecuador. Learning of her relationship status from social media, her mother, Linda, tells her to come home in order to move on, where she reunites with her agoraphobic brother, Jeffrey. Initially refusing, Linda agrees to go on the trip with her daughter.
In Ecuador, after they check into the upscale hotel, Emily meets a handsome man named James at the hotel bar, and they begin a relationship. After one night of drinking and dancing with James, Emily and her mother take a sightseeing day trip with him. During their ride, masked men in a white van ram James' Jeep and abduct Emily and Linda. James escapes, but Linda suspects he was in on the kidnapping plot from the start. Emily awakens inside a cell and begins to panic, while Linda calms herself by reading men's magazines. The leader, Hector Morgado, contacts Jeffrey and demands $100,000 in ransom money. Morgado then has his nephew take both women away from the kidnappers' hideout to another location. They manage to escape from their captors' car and stow away into a passing truck, but not before Emily kills the leader's nephew by pounding his head with a shovel. The truck's driver then stops his truck and leaves them both in the middle of the jungle.
They find a phone at a nearby bar, where they call the U.S. State Department officer Morgan Russell, saying that they are in peril, and Morgan advises them to go to the US Embassy in Bogota, Colombia. They meet a rugged-looking American named Roger Simmons. He agrees to help them find the consulate. After the three share a meal, Morgado and his men track them down. Morgado is about to kill them both as revenge for his only nephew's death, but Linda distracts him while Emily retrieves a nearby spear gun with which to threaten him. As she retrieves it, she accidentally fires it, killing Morgado's only son. They manage to escape with Simmons onto a boat. That's where they learn he is not an experienced outdoorsman, but a Trader Joe's manager who recently found out he has a month to live due to a cancer diagnosis. His dream is to live like an adventurer. Soon, however, they are forced off the boat when the captain detects another boat nearby that is looking for the two women.
Meanwhile, Jeffrey, learning that his mother and sister have been kidnapped, calls Morgan at the State Department, saying he will join forces with the agents in order to find his mother and sister. Morgan reluctantly agrees. In Colombia, Emily, Linda, and Simmons hike through the jungle until Simmons falls to his death from a cliff. Later, Emily passes out from the effects of a tapeworm infestation. After a local village doctor removes the tapeworm from her body, Morgado and his men track them down again. They spot a zip line and decide to use it to escape. Unfortunately, the zip line is good for only one person. Linda forces Emily to leave her behind and is recaptured.
Emily safely arrives at the US Consulate. Determined to find her mother, she seeks help from two feisty American women veterans, Ruth and Barb, whom Emily met at the resort in Ecuador. Ruth and Barb take her to James, who was conspiring with Morgado, to the apartment where he is being interrogated for the kidnappers' location. With the ladies' help, Emily rescues her mother at the kidnappers' apartment. They try to escape in another truck, but Morgado intercepts them. As he is about to kill Emily, Linda blows her dog whistle (which was supposed to serve as a rape whistle), summoning a dog that attacks Morgado. U.S. State Department agents arrive to arrest Morgado, and Jeffrey reunites with his mother and sister.
One year later, Emily and Linda take another trip to Kuala Lumpur, at which point Emily meets another man, who offers her a drink. Emily refuses, and she and Linda proceed to dance."
Lowriders,A contemporary tale about a teen whose loyalties are tested when an annual lowrider event forces him to choose between his father and his criminal brother.
The Wall,"During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews (John Cena) is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).
The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process.
Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers.
Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws.
Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of a rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.
Isaac hears the rescue helicopters coming, so he pushes down the wall and uses Matthews' rifle to try and kill Juba, or at least flush him out so the rescue chopper can see the trap. Juba fires at Issac twice and misses. Issac now has the snipers location and fires his only round. Issac stands up and waits for Juba's next shot, but it never comes. The helicopters land and the rescue team picks up Isaac and Matthews. Once the helicopters dust off, the sniper successfully shoots down both in rapid succession. He is then heard over the radio, calling for another rescue to set a new trap."

They plan to fly to Paris, but the pilot suggests Anne not fly due to an ear infection. Michael's producing partner Jacques (Arnaud Viard) offers to drive Anne to Paris himself.
What is supposed to be a short car ride quickly devolves into a pleasant leisurely trip as Jacques, a French foodie, can't resist taking any opportunity he can to stop every hour or so to sample new food. He is also openly flirtatious with Anne but she begins to question his intentions when he repeatedly uses her credit card to foot the bill for the gourmet meals they are sampling. They visit a church where Anne grieves the baby she lost, and tells Jacques she wears her locket necklace in his honor. They share a romantic dinner together where Jacques admires Anne's photography, and asks why she doesn't share it with her husband.
Later, on the road, Jacques confides that only he knows his brother's death was a suicide, and he carries that burden so his nephew doesn't have to know. They finally reach the place where Anne is staying and almost kiss, but the elevator doors close in on them. Anne sees Jacques has driven away, but he returns to kiss her passionately and ask her to rendezvous with him later in San Francisco.
Days later, she receives a package from Jacques with chocolate roses and the money she had lent him on the trip. It includes a note that reminds her of the restaurant they will be meeting at, and she smiles at the camera suggestively."
Alien: Covenant,"In a prologue, business magnate Peter Weyland speaks with his newly activated android, who chooses the name ""David"" after observing Michelangelo’s statue of David. Weyland tells David that one day they will search for mankind's creator together. David comments on his own unlimited lifespan compared to his creator's limited one, which unsettles Weyland.
In 2104, 11 years after the Prometheus expedition, the colonization ship Covenant is bound for remote planet Origae-6, with two thousand colonists in stasis and 1,140 human embryos aboard. The ship is monitored by Walter, a newer android model that physically resembles David. A stellar burst damages the ship, killing 47 colonists. Walter orders the ship's computer to wake the crew of 14, which includes several married couples. The ship's captain, Jake Branson, dies when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a radio transmission of a human voice from a nearby (two weeks’ travel) planet, which appears eminently more habitable than Origae-6 (still 7 years away). Despite the protests of Daniels, Branson’s widow, that this new ""perfect"" planet is too good to be true, newly-promoted captain Oram decides that they are going to divert and check the new planet.
With pilot Tennessee maintaining Covenant in orbit, his wife Maggie flies a small lander to the Earth-like planet's surface, where an expedition team tracks the transmission's signal to a crashed alien ship. Crew members Ledward and Hallett are infected by spores from a black fungus-like organism. Oram's wife Karine helps the increasingly ill Ledward back to the lander where Maggie quarantines them inside the med-bay. A small, pale, alien neomorph bursts from Ledward's back, killing him, and then kills Karine. Maggie attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but triggers an explosion which kills her and destroys the lander. Nearby, another neomorph bursts from Hallett's mouth, killing him as well.
The neomorphs attack the remaining crew and kills Ankor. The crew manages to kill a neomorph before David, who survived the Prometheus mission, scares away the other, and leads the crew to a temple in a city full of dead humanoids. David tells them that upon his and fellow Prometheus survivor Elizabeth Shaw's arrival at the planet, their ship released a black liquid bio-weapon which annihilated the native population and that Shaw died when the ship crashed in the ensuing chaos. The crew members attempt to contact the Covenant but are prevented by fierce storms. When a neomorph infiltrates the structure and kills Rosenthal, David tries to communicate with the creature, and is horrified when Oram kills it. Oram questions David, who reveals that the aliens are a result of his experimenting with the black liquid in an attempt to create a new species. He manipulates Oram into being attacked by a facehugger alien. An alien xenomorph later erupts from Oram's chest, killing him.
As the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter finds Shaw's dissected corpse, used by David as material for his evolving creature designs. David explains that he believes humans are a dying species and should not be allowed to colonize the galaxy. When Walter disagrees, David disables him, and threatens Daniels. Walter recovers (being a superior model capable of self-repair) and fights with David while Daniels escapes. A facehugger attacks security chief Lope, but he is later rescued by crew member Cole. The now fully grown Xenomorph kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Tennessee arrives in another lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who claims David has ""expired"". They successfully kill the attacking Xenomorph and return to the Covenant.
The next morning, Daniels and Tennessee find out that another Xenomorph burst from Lope's chest, killing him, and is loose on the Covenant. It matures, and kills crew members Ricks and his wife Upworth. Remaining crew members Tennessee and Daniels lure the creature into the Covenant's terraforming bay and flush it into space.
The Covenant resumes its trip to Origae-6. As Walter helps Daniels into stasis, she realizes that he is in fact David, but is unable to escape her pod before falling asleep. David regurgitates two facehugger embryos and places them in cold storage alongside the human embryos. He then poses as Walter to record a log stating that all crewmembers except Daniels and Tennessee were killed by the neutrino blast at the beginning of the film and that the ship is still on course for Origae-6."
Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul,"One year after the previous film, while at the Corny's family restaurant, the Heffley family plans to attend Meemaw's 90th birthday. However, after Greg rescues his younger brother Manny, who got stuck inside a tube in the play area, Greg ends up in a ball pit with a diaper stuck on his hand. He freaks out and started screaming. He subsequently becomes infamous after the people around him record him and post the footage on the internet, leading Greg to be dubbed as ""Diaper Hands"".
Later, at the Heffley residence, Greg learns that Player Expo is taking place not very far from Meemaw's house in Indianapolis. Greg's gaming star, Mac Digby, will be attending, and Greg hopes to meet him and get in one of his videos so he will gain popularity. He acknowledges that he will have to somehow sneak off from the road trip and attend the Expo without his parents' knowledge, however. The Heffley family hits the road, where Greg, Rodrick, Frank, and Manny's devices are immediately confiscated by Susan, who wants the road trip to be ""absolutely technology-free.""
After arriving at a motel, Greg discreetly gets into the Sienna and takes his phone out of the bag Susan had put it in and plans to use it. Later, when Greg and Rodrick are relaxing in the hot tub, Rodrick hears a notification from Greg's phone and discovers his plans to go to Player Expo. Greg discourages Rodrick from telling Susan, saying that they had a rock band video game tournament there that Rodrick could participate in. Liking the idea, Rodrick opts to go with Greg to the Expo.
Greg later encounters a family, whom he nicknames ""the Beardos"" due to the father's long beard, after being annoyed by a loud noise created by the Beardo siblings, who are playing with a cart, and storms out of the room in his underwear. He confronts them but Brandi, the eldest sibling, rolls the trolley into their Sienna, leaving a huge scratch. Just as Mr. Beardo comes out of his motel room, Brandi blames Greg for the damage and Mr. Beardo goes after him but he escapes. He returns to his hotel room and falls asleep. The next morning, Greg realizes he slept in the Beardos hotel room, but is able to escape.
The next day, the Heffleys attend a county fair where Manny wins a pig. Mr. Beardo and his family notices Greg and begins chasing after him but manages to outrun yet again. Back on the road, the Heffleys, unable to take care of the pig, drop it off at the petting zoo, much to Manny's dismay, but not before Greg reroutes the GPS to the Player Expo convention. Checking at the hotel room, Greg and Rodrick sneak out to go to Player Expo. However, after Frank and Susan see their sons on live television, they go to get the boys themselves.
Upon Greg sees Mac Digby participating in a video game competition, Greg instructs Rodrick to record him going up on stage with Mac so his popularity will boost, but the attempt fails when Susan storms into the stage and inadvertently reveals that he is Diaper Hands to the public. Susan opens up to Greg and says that all she wanted was a nice road trip that would bring the family closer together, and she accuses Greg of not caring.
Infuriated, Greg snaps back at Susan, saying that she doesn't care about what he loves, which is why he had to sneak out to the Expo in the first place. Hurt by her son's words, Susan hands her phone to Greg because she doesn't care anymore.
After encountering the Beardos and other obstacles on the road, the Heffleys celebrate happily at Meemaw's. Returning home, Manny manages to get the pig back. At the end, Greg explains that although the road trip wasn't perfect, he still wouldn't change a thing.
He says that Manny was allowed to keep his pig as a pet, Rodrick was able to get a Toyota Sienna 2018 Limited AWD, and Dad was able to explain having time off from work to bond with family. Greg expresses excitement for where they'll be going next year, but Susan steps in to say they will be flying.
In a mid-credits scene, two girls take selfies with Greg, who they recognize as Diaper Hands."
"Everything, Everything","Eighteen-year-old Maddy suffers from SCID, an immuno-deficiency disease that prevents her from leaving her home and interacting with others. Her mother, Pauline Whittier, takes care of her with the help of her nurse Carla, who has taken care of Madeline for 15 years. Only Pauline, Carla and Carla's daughter, Rosa, are allowed in the home. Maddy yearns to see the world, particularly the ocean.
One day, a new family moves next door, and their son, who is Maddy's age, catches her eye. They share a look as Maddy watches through the window. Later that night, while Pauline and Maddy are watching a movie, the boy and his sister appear on their doorstep, offering a bundt cake. Pauline politely rejects it, and as she's about to close the door, the boy asks where her daughter is. Pauline lies and tells him Maddy is not home. It is also revealed that the father of the boy is violent and their relationship is strained.
Later, the boy writes his number on his window for Maddy and soon they begin communicating through text. He introduces himself as Olly, and they text for a while, getting to know each other and eventually growing very fond of each other.
Knowing her mother won't approve, Maddy convinces Carla to secretly let Olly visit her inside the house, though Carla makes them promise to stay on different sides of the room from each other. She later invites Olly over for the Fourth of July, since her mother is working that day. Maddy and Olly share a passionate kiss as fireworks go off outside.
The next day, Maddy notices Olly fighting with his father outside. When his father shoves him to the ground, Maddy, to the shock of her mother, rushes outside to comfort Olly. Her mother rushes her back inside. Maddy briefly falls ill from the minute she spent outside. Pauline deduces that Maddy and Olly have been seeing each other, and forbids their relationship. She later terminates Carla for betraying her trust.
Maddy decides that it's time to take matters into her own hands. With a credit card she'd previously opened online, Maddy buys two plane tickets to Hawaii, and convinces Olly to travel there with her. In Hawaii, they share a romantic and life-changing experience together.
During the trip, Maddy passes out and Olly rushes her to the hospital. She wakes up back in her bed at home. She breaks off contact with Olly due to the fact that she doesn't want to make another mistake over love again, and is therefore unable to say goodbye when his mother finally decides to leave his father, and Olly, his mother and sister leave back to New York, where they are from.
A doctor from the hospital in Hawaii calls Maddy to give a following update and tells Maddy that she does not have something as severe as SCID. Maddy scours her mother's records, and cannot find anything that indicates that she's ever been diagnosed with the disorder. She realizes that her mother has been lying to her for her whole life, and runs away from home.
Maddy stays with Carla and Rosa. A doctor confirms that she's never had SCID, just an underdeveloped immune system from under-exposure due to living in filtered air her whole life. Her mother later tells her that, after Maddy's father and brother died in a car crash, Maddy was all she had left and she wanted to protect her and keep her safe.
Maddy takes a plane to meet Olly. She apologizes for not saying goodbye, and they start their relationship anew."
Wakefield,"The story is told from the point of view of Howard Wakefield, through narration that reveals his evolving emotional state. A successful attorney in New York City, he is unhappy in his marriage of 15 years to Diana, a beautiful art curator and former dancer. They used to use flirtation with other people to add excitement to their sex life, but she soon begins to resent it. One night, Howard returns home late from his commute by train and is distracted by a raccoon he sees entering his garage, which is detached from the house. He chases the raccoon into the garage's attic, where he realizes he has a perfect view into his home, where his wife and two daughters, Taylor and Giselle, are eating dinner. He ignores calls from his wife and is amused at her clear annoyance, but is insulted when she angrily throws his plate of dinner away instead of saving it for him. To avoid a fight, he decides to wait a bit to go into the house, but he ends up falling asleep.
The next morning, Howard realizes Diana will never believe his story of spending the night in the garage and will insist he was having an affair, so he plans to wait for her to leave for work before going in. Instead, he is shocked when, after finding his car still in the garage, she calls the police to report him missing. Howard feels bad when he sees Diana cry, but before he can go inside, his overbearing mother-in-law, Babs, shows up to comfort her. Babs appears to be saying that Howard has run off while Diana apparently defends him, showing her there is no evidence he has taken any money. Diana then leaves for work and Howard finally goes inside and showers, planning to just deal with the fallout of his absence, before he starts resenting the idea that his wife would still go to work after his disappearance. It then dawns on him that his disappearance is probably a relief to her, and that she probably thinks that she married the wrong man. He cleans up any evidence that he was inside the house, grabs some food from the pantry and returns to the garage.
Howard is overjoyed with abandoning all his responsibilities and amused that people would surely suspect his wife's involvement in his disappearance, just as he is amused at seeing her tackle the chores that used to be his responsibility. He feels unshackled and free as he spends his time doing puzzles, reading and observing his family and their neighbors. He also happily realizes that he is seeing more of his daughters' lives than he did before. For the first few days, he continues to sneak food and amenities from his house. He soon realizes that he no longer cares about having clients and being freshly showered and shaved, and vows not to take anything from his old life or spend the money he has in his wallet. He begins foraging each night through the trash and showers in the backyard bathroom built by his neighbor, Dr. Sondervan, who runs a small home for mentally disabled youth.
As months go by and he grows a beard and long hair, Howard is free to walk about town during the day, where people dismiss him as homeless. The only people who discover his presence are Herbert and Emily, two of Dr. Sondervan's residents, who follow him back to the attic one day. He reflects on the beginning of his relationship with Diana, whom he met when she was dating his best friend Dirk Morrison, an extremely competitive Wall Street trader. Through manipulation and dishonesty, Howard managed to take Diana away from Dirk, and as he thinks back, Howard wonders if he ever truly loved her. Nevertheless, he realizes that by simply disappearing, he has the upper hand in controlling her love life. If he had just divorced her, she would be free to date other men, but while he is missing under mysterious circumstances, she can't easily move on to another man.
As summer turns into fall, Howard no longer basks in his freedom but instead feels like he has become a prisoner of his choices. He has an epiphany and realizes that the old Howard had been a selfish, jealous and resentful husband and father, who made himself out to be a victim. While he feels happy to be free from himself, he also feels that his family is happier without him. He also realizes that he has never loved Diana more and one day, he walks out onto the sidewalk, but Diana doesn't recognize him.
Diana appears to be developing a romantic relationship, and Howard is stunned when he sees it is with Dirk Morrison. Howard surmises that Dirk would have probably told Diana the lies he had said that broke them up years ago. He decides to give Diana an honest chance this time to pick with whom she wants to be. After getting himself cleaned up and buying a new suit, Howard works up the courage to walk back into his house. As he sees his wife and daughters decorating the Christmas tree, he envisions them being overjoyed at his return, and also envisions a second scenario in which they respond with horror. He pauses, and then comes in through the front door and announces, ""I'm home."""
Baywatch,"In Emerald Bay, Florida, Lt. Mitch Buchannon and his team of lifeguards, including second-in-command Stephanie Holden and veteran C. J. Parker, protect the beaches and the bay as part of an elite division known as Baywatch. Having made over 500 rescues in his career, Mitch is beloved by the community, to the annoyance of local beat cop Garner Ellerbee and Mitch's superior, Captain Thorpe. During one of his morning patrols, Mitch discovers a small pouch of flakka drug washed up near the Huntley Club, which is now under the ownership of businesswoman Victoria Leeds, who has been secretly bribing city councilman Rodriguez and others in efforts to increase her stake in the bay.
At the tryouts for prospective lifeguards, three people stand out: surfer Summer Quinn, an old friend of Holden; Ronnie, a chubby computer nerd with a crush on C. J.; and Matt Brody, a former Olympic gold medal swimmer who fell from grace to grass after vomiting during a relay race. Summer and Ronnie both pass the trials, but Brody refuses to participate, insisting his Olympic status and recommendation letter entitles him to have a place on the team. Mitch challenges Brody on a course of the former's choosing, but a drowning woman and her kids interrupt the challenge and they rush to save her. Mitch learns Brody has to perform community service as part of an unspecified plea deal, and that Thorpe insists rehabilitating Brody's image is necessary to convince the city not to further cut Baywatch's funding.
When a private yacht catches fire, Brody disobeys orders and dives directly under the flames, causing Holden and C. J. to have to save him. The occupants are evacuated, except for the deceased councilman Rodriguez. Ellerbee disapproves of Mitch's further investigative actions. Mitch and the gang attend a party held by Leeds to look for more evidence but without much luck as Brody makes a fool of himself getting drunk. Mitch, Brody, and Summer later infiltrate the city morgue, where they record two of Leeds' men planting a falsified autopsy report to cover up the fact that Rodriguez was murdered on her orders. Unfortunately, they are discovered, and though Mitch manages to subdue and capture one of them, the recording is destroyed and Ellerbee is forced to release their suspect on a lack of evidence. Angered, Thorpe threatens to fire Mitch if he oversteps his authority again.
Convinced that Leeds is running drugs out of the Huntley, Mitch and Brody go undercover and sneak into the club kitchen, where they witness her workers retrieving the drugs from barrels of fish and processing them. They contact Ellerbee, only to learn that another body has been found on the beach. Thorpe, enraged that Mitch essentially deserted his post, fires him and names Brody as the new lieutenant. Brody accepts the job reluctantly, and Mitch takes a job as a cellphone salesman.
After finding another pouch of flakka on the beach, Brody steals the second victim's report from Ellerbee and brings it to Summer, who confirms his suspicion that the man was murdered. Ronnie, upon recognizing the victim as his friend Dave, helps Brody hack into Leeds' servers, revealing her plan to privatize the entire beach by systematically buying out or eliminating every competing business owner.
The team infiltrates a private party on Leeds' personal yacht, discovering how she's been using the hull to smuggle the drugs. Brody is captured and placed in a bait cage to be drowned, and a gloating Leeds reveals that she bribed the corrupt Thorpe to set Mitch up so he could justify firing him before pushing the cage into the water. Just before Brody drowns, Mitch appears and saves him. The two catch up to Leeds, while Ronnie and C. J. launch fireworks to prevent her escape helicopter from landing. Just as they run out, a wounded Mitch, having intentionally stung himself with a sea urchin to boost his adrenaline, uses a Roman candle to blow Leeds up, saving Brody once again. Ellerbee arrives and takes Leeds' henchmen into custody, apologizing to Mitch for doubting him. Thorpe arrives and begins to berate Mitch for returning to the beach. In response, Brody punches Thorpe in the face. Thorpe is subsequently arrested for his role in Leeds' plan.
In the aftermath, Ronnie and Brody begin relationships with C.J. and Summer respectively. Mitch, having been reinstated, formally inducts Summer, Ronnie, and Brody into Baywatch and introduces them to their new captain, Casey Jean (Pamela Anderson)."
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,"Twelve-year-old Henry Turner boards the Flying Dutchman and informs his father, Will Turner, that the curse which binds Will to the Dutchman and only permits him to step on land once a decade can be broken by the Trident of Poseidon. Henry intends to recruit Captain Jack Sparrow to help find it, but Will believes this is impossible and orders Henry to leave. Will and the Dutchman then disappear into the sea, but Henry vows to find Jack and the Trident.
Nine years later, Henry is a sailor in the British Royal Navy. The ship sails into the supernatural Devil's Triangle and stumbles upon the wreck of the Silent Mary, whose ghostly crew led by Spanish pirate-hunter Captain Salazar attack. Salazar spares Henry's life to deliver a message to Jack: Salazar is coming for him.
In Saint Martin, a young astronomer and horologist named Carina Smyth is sentenced to death for witchcraft but escapes and briefly crosses paths with Jack as he and his crew spectacularly blunder a bank robbery. Having suffered years of such bad luck, Jack's crew lose faith and abandon him. Depressed, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass frees Salazar and his crew from the Devil's Triangle. Carina learns Henry is looking for the Trident's location and offers to help him using her unknown father's diary. Carina and Jack are captured and face execution, but are saved by Henry and Jack's crew, setting sail on the Dying Gull. Carina deciphers clues that the stars will lead to an island where the Trident is hidden.
Meanwhile, Captain Barbossa hears from his pirate crew that the revived Captain Salazar has killed several pirates at sea, and learns that the Trident could lead him to a new ""treasure"". Barbossa sets off to find the Trident, until Salazar and his crew appear and destroy Barbossa's fleet. Barbossa manages to talk his way out of being killed by offering to help find Jack. Salazar agrees, wanting revenge on the pirate that caused his demise. Salazar pursues the Dying Gull, forcing Jack, Henry, and Carina to flee to an island, discovering that Salazar's crew cannot go on land. After saving Jack from a forced marriage, Barbossa allies himself with Jack, returning his compass and restoring the miniaturized Black Pearl, trapped in a bottle by Blackbeard, to its original size. They all continue their journey to the Trident's island, with Barbossa taking command of the Pearl once more. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realize Carina is the latter's long-lost daughter. Barbossa tells Jack that he had left her at an orphanage with his diary so she could live a better life, and refuses to tell her the truth so she will continue to believe her father was an astronomer.
Approaching the Trident's island, the Pearl evades a British Navy warship, which is destroyed by the Silent Mary before the Pearl runs aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa, and Carina use the island's magic to part the ocean and open a path to the Trident's location on the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and demonically possesses his body in order to walk on the ocean floor and seize the Trident. Once he does so, Henry is given his body back and decides to destroy the Trident, breaking all curses upon the sea and restoring Salazar's crew to life. However, the divided sea begins to collapse in on itself. The Pearl lowers its anchor to lift them to safety, but Salazar pursues them, still hell-bent on killing Jack. Carina realizes that Barbossa is her father when she spots a tattoo on his arm identical to the diary's cover. Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar, allowing the others to escape alive.
Some time later, Henry and Carina reach Port Royal, where Will appears, free from the Dutchman. His wife, Elizabeth, appears moments later and the Turner family reunites. Henry and Carina begin a relationship as well. Jack watches from the Pearl in faux-disgust before sailing away into the horizon, having been accepted by his crew as their captain once again.
In a post-credits scene, Will appears to have a nightmare where a resurrected Davy Jones enters his room, oblivious that Jones left a trace of wet barnacles on the floor beneath he and Elizabeth."
War Machine,"In the summer of 2009, four-star General Glen McMahon (Brad Pitt), having won renown for his effective leadership in Iraq, is sent to Afghanistan to prepare an assessment so that the government can end the ongoing war.[4][5] He is given wide latitudes to write it, on the sole condition that he not request more troops. McMahon and his staff, particularly his right hand man Major General Greg Pulver (Anthony Michael Hall), are united in their belief that the war can be won, and decide to recommend that President Obama authorize a surge of 40,000 additional troops to secure Helmand province in order to stabilize the country. However, the Secretary of State (Sian Thomas) informs McMahon that his report will not be reviewed until after the upcoming presidential election.
Captain Badi Basim (Aymen Hamdouchi), a member of the Afghan National Army, joins McMahon's staff as a ""representative"" of the Afghan people. He arrives, however, in civilian clothes as he would rather not wear his uniform, which he has in a bag, outside the compound near his home as he walked. Meanwhile, McMahon is informed that, due to alleged irregularities in the counting of votes, a runoff election will have to be held, delaying the review of the assessment further. Fed up, McMahon secretly leaks the assessment to the Washington Post and organizes an interview with 60 Minutes, during which he reveals that, in the last seventy days, he has only been granted one meeting with the President. In response, the government announces that they will send 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, and that all U.S. and coalition forces in the country will leave in 18 months. To gather the remaining 10,000 troops needed for his strategy to work, McMahon and his men head to Paris to negotiate with the other coalition nations.
In Paris, McMahon learns that the President is passing through, and wishes to meet with him. The ambassador to Afghanistan (Alan Ruck) warns McMahon that he needs to understand his position: if he continues to anger the President, he will be fired for insubordination. The President, however, merely shakes his hand as he climbs aboard Air Force One due to time constraints, and McMahon and his staff attend a dinner in McMahon's honor, accompanied by Rolling Stone writer Sean Cullen (Scoot McNairy), who intends to write a feature story about his performance for an upcoming issue. The next day, during their anniversary dinner, McMahon's wife Jeanie confronts him about how much time he's spending fighting abroad instead of being with his family back home.
While en route to Berlin with McMahon's staff to continue negotiations, Cullen observes their behavior and concludes that they are arrogant and seem to care little about the growing public perception that the war is costly and wasteful. At a conference to discuss his strategy, McMahon is confronted by a German official (Tilda Swinton) who is skeptical of his approach and suggests that McMahon's plans would only lead to more losses. Nevertheless, both the Germans and the French agree to furnish the troops needed for his planned offensive, codenamed ""Operation Moshtarak"", to begin, with Afghan President Hamid Karzai's (Ben Kingsley) approval.
The operation launches, but soon runs into trouble when several civilians are accidentally killed against McMahon's instructions. When he holds a public meeting to explain the incident, the crowd grows hostile and demands that he and his troops leave. Worse, McMahon learns that Cullen's article has been published, and paints a negative picture of him and his staff as openly speaking against the President and mishandling the war effort. Knowing that he will be fired for his actions, McMahon returns to Washington and later takes a job as a civilian consultant.
In the aftermath, Cullen ponders the consequences of his article, noting that he wished McMahon's fall would finally convince the government to stop invading foreign countries and end the war in Afghanistan. Instead, however, the government simply assigns a new general to replace McMahon: General Bob White (Russell Crowe)."
Wonder Woman,"In present-day Paris, Diana receives a photographic plate from Wayne Enterprises of herself and four men taken during World War I, prompting her to recall her past. Daughter of Queen Hippolyta, Diana was raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazonian warrior women created by Zeus to protect mankind. Hippolyta shares the Amazonian history with Diana, including how Ares, Zeus's son, became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat (thus dying in the process). Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the ""Godkiller"", to prepare them for Ares' return.
Although she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister, Antiope, train Diana, only more rigorously than any other warrior. In 1917, Diana, now a young woman, rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by a German light cruiser that had been pursuing Trevor. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana (by taking the bullet fired from a German sailor that was meant for Diana). Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia, and reveals that a great war is consuming the outside world and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas, under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff from a weapon facility in the Ottoman Empire. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the ""Godkiller"" sword, the lasso, and her armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.
In London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the Western Front. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Sir Patrick, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in Belgium. Diana goes alone through No Man's Land and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, while Diana and Steve grow closer romantically.
The team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, while Diana intends to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills Ludendorff, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.
Sir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the ""Godkiller"" sword, he destroys it, then reveals Diana to be the ""Godkiller"", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself in the process. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares' lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the end of the war. In the present day, Diana sends an email to Bruce Wayne thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve and reaffirms her new mission to fight and give on the world's behalf."
Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie,"In the city of Piqua, Ohio, two fourth-grade friends and next-door neighbors named George Beard (Kevin Hart) and Harold Hutchins (Thomas Middleditch) are the pranksters at their school, Jerome Horwitz Elementary School. They excessively pull numerous pranks on the cruel teachers, many of which are directed at their ""evil"" principal, Mr. Benjamin ""Benny"" Krupp (Ed Helms), putting the two at odds with him. The duo also create comic books about a superhero named Captain Underpants, a character who has superpowers and wears underwear and a cape. They sell these to their schoolmates through a comic company called Treehouse Comix Inc., located in their treehouse. George and Harold's pranks come to an apparent end after they're caught tampering with a toilet invention, the Turbo Toilet 2000, made by the school's local snitch and intellectual, Melvin Sneedly (Jordan Peele), on video. Finally having solid proof of the boys' antics, Mr. Krupp excitedly prepares to annihilate their friendship by putting them in separate classes.
To prevent this, George hypnotizes Mr. Krupp with a 3D Hypno Ring he received out of a cereal box. The boys see that Mr. Krupp bears an odd resemblance to Captain Underpants without his toupee and command him to be Captain Underpants. The boys soon learn the severity of their actions when ""Captain Underpants"" begins causing problems around Piqua. To prevent these issues, the boys take him to their treehouse, where they discover that they can turn Captain Underpants back into Mr. Krupp by splashing water on him and can turn him back into Captain Underpants by snapping their fingers. Knowing that Mr. Krupp will continue trying to separate them, they decide to settle with Captain Underpants but insist that he be dressed up as Mr. Krupp under the pretense of a ""secret identity,"" to which Captain Underpants agrees. His sudden personality change even manages to attract the attention (and affection) of the school's shy lunch lady, Edith (Kristen Schaal).
Just when George and Harold believe that their troubles have ended, Jerome Horwitz Elementary School is visited by an odd, German-accented scientist named Professor Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants, Esq. (Nick Kroll), or as he calls himself, Professor P. Captain Underpants (disguised as Mr. Krupp) hires him to be the new science teacher, but George and Harold are suspicious of him due to his violent and short-tempered attitude, as well as his resume's content. As it turns out, Poopypants is seeking to get rid of laughter altogether due to the fact that people have made fun of his name for years. He recruits Melvin to help him, as he discovers (after reading a comic book George and Harold made featuring characters resembling them) that Melvin's brain makes him incapable of laughing or having fun.
After a school carnival accident caused by Captain Underpants, Mr. Krupp finally separates the boys. Professor Poopypants tries to take over the town with a giant version of the Turbo Toilet 2000, fueled by the school cafeteria's rotten leftovers left out by Edith and uses Melvin's brain to turn the children into glum, humorless zombies. Captain Underpants tries to stop the villain, but due to having no actual superpowers, is effortlessly defeated and thrown into the toilet. George and Harold are captured and nearly turned into zombies, but are able to escape after Professor Poopypants mentions the planet Uranus, causing the boys to laugh and damage the Turbo Toilet 2000's computer, restoring the children back to normal. Upon consuming the mutated leftovers, Captain Underpants acquires superpowers and, with George and Harold's help, defeats and shrinks Poopypants, though he escapes on a bumblebee shortly thereafter.
Knowing that they can't control Captain Underpants, George and Harold destroy the Hypno Ring to permanently change him back into Mr. Krupp. Feeling that Mr. Krupp would be nicer if he had friends, the boys set him and lovesick Edith up on a date, thus making Mr. Krupp have a change of heart. Krupp returns the comics he took away from George and Harold, and even admits their comics are funny. However, the toxic waste from the Turbo Toilet 2000 transforms all the toilets into vicious monsters which attack the restaurant at which Mr. Krupp and Edith are dining. Upon snapping his fingers, Mr. Krupp once again becomes Captain Underpants, carrying George and Harold away to help him fight them, much to Edith's surprise and admiration.
In a mid-credits scene, George and Harold realize that the secretary, who they put on hold before by faking a contest with a cash prize of $1 billion, has been on the phone for the entire film, so they shut off the call, make the secretary angry, and make a new comic based on her reaction."
Dean,"Dean (Demetri Martin) lives in Brooklyn and has recently lost his mother. His father Robert (Kevin Kline) is an engineer who lives in the suburbs and is having difficulty adjusting to a life alone. Dean's ex-fiancée Michelle (Christine Woods) attempts to give back the engagement ring, as Dean has ""un-proposed."" Dean refuses, suggesting she put it on a charm bracelet.
Dean's best friend Brett (Reid Scott) is getting married. Dean is actually the ""second best"" man behind Kevin (Barry Rothbart). Brett and Dean were roommates, along with Eric (Rory Scovel) who has flown out from Los Angeles for the wedding. During the wedding ceremony, Dean sees Michelle's wedding date and gets distracted. When asked to produce the wedding ring, he fumbles with it and drops it. Later during the reception, a drunken Kevin finishes up the best man speech. Dean begins his best man speech, but gets rudely interrupted by Kevin, who gets up and starts swinging at Dean.
Waking up in bed with his face in donuts the next morning, Dean gets a call from Robert. Robert says it is time to sell the house. Dean cannot deal with that, so tells his father to wait because he has to fly to Los Angeles to meet with ad agency ""creatives"" who want to use his drawings. His father has been frustrated by Dean's lack of engagement, and has already brought in realtors Carol (Mary Steenburgen) and Patrick (Peter Scolari). Robert assumes that Patrick and Carol are husband and wife, but Carol says they are not. Robert sees that Carol has an online dating profile on her PC behind her realtor work. While he begins critiquing her profile, a relationship begins to form.
Dean meets with the advertising creatives, but is put off by their strange work habits and attitudes. They want to use his work to represent the ""before"" drawings in an advertisement for deodorant. The main character in the ad is a nerd, but the pitch is to have the deodorant enable the character to draw amazing detailed drawings after using the product. Dean excuses himself and leaves.
Dean calls his friends in Los Angeles including Becca and Eric. He goes to a party and meets Nicky (Gillian Jacobs). He is immediately taken by her, but clumsily tips over a serving tray when he absent-mindedly leans on it. He still pursues her, despite Nicky's friend Jill repeatedly dragging her away, and manages to give her his phone number, written on a small notebook paper in a ""twentieth-century way."" The next day Dean spends time with Eric and finds out he is a cat person, with cat furniture all over his bedroom.
As Dean is leaving Los Angeles, he gets a text on his iPhone from Nicky inviting him to come play volleyball at the beach. He leaves the plane and an annoying seat mate behind and heads to the beach, where he is seen dragging his suitcase across the sand. He finally finds Nicky, and they go out to have a dinner date. He kisses her at the end of the date. She invites Dean to come to an art gallery with Jill.
Nicky tells Dean that she and Jill will be going up to San Francisco. Dean says that he also had planned to go to the Bay area with Eric. The four end up driving together. Right as they are about to go on a hike, Eric gets a call from his roommate telling him that a bookcase has dropped on his cat. Eric demands to be taken to the San Francisco airport immediately to fly home. Dean goes to a hotel, because Nicky tells him that Jill's parents would not be comfortable with him staying there. He tries to kiss Nicky goodbye, but Jill honks the car horn and interrupts them.
Nicky later comes back to Dean's hotel room and spends the night with him. Dean tells Nicky that he thinks he might be falling in love with her, and tells her about the failed engagement and mother dying. Later in the morning, Nicky is gone. There is a hand-written ""twentieth-century style"" letter for Dean at the front desk. In it, Nicky explains that she is married, but has been separated. Jill had been telling Nicky to divulge that to Dean, but there was never an opportunity.
Robert and Carol have been going out together in New York. They return from a play, where they both confess they had no idea what was going on. Carol invites Robert up to her apartment for coffee, and Robert is unable to, because he is ""still married"".
At the end of the film Dean has returned to New York, and finished his next book. He sends a signed copy back to Eric. Robert has moved into a new apartment in the city. Dean tearfully admits that he has not been there, but he and Robert finally reconcile with each other. Later Robert sees Carol walking in his neighborhood, and they walk on together."
The Mummy,"In 1157 A.D., several English crusader knights bury an Egyptian ruby within the tomb of one of their members. In present-day London, a construction crew discovers the tomb and a mysterious man is authorized to investigate the site.
In a flashback to the New Kingdom era, Princess Ahmanet is first in line to succeed her father Menehptre until his second wife gives birth to a son. Determined to claim the throne for herself, Ahmanet summons Set, who agrees to help her if she uses a mystical dagger known as the Dagger of Set to transfer his spirit into a physical form. After murdering her father, his wife, and their child, Ahmanet attempts to sacrifice her lover to Set but is captured by her father's priests and condemned to be mummified alive for eternity. Her sarcophagus is buried in Mesopotamia and submerged in a pool of mercury so that her monstrous form will not escape.
In present-day Iraq, Sergeant Nick Morton and Corporal Chris Vail, while on Long Range Reconnaissance for the U.S. Army, discover the tomb of Ahmanet after calling in an airstrike on an insurgent stronghold. Jenny Halsey, an archaeologist who had a one-night stand with Nick and had her map stolen by him, arrives and investigates the tomb, correctly concluding that it is a prison. After Nick extracts Ahmanet's sarcophagus from the pool of mercury, Nick's superior, Colonel Greenway, places it on a transport plane headed to England. During the flight, Vail becomes possessed by Ahmanet's power after being bitten by a camel spider while inside the tomb. After attempting to open the sarcophagus, he stabs Greenway and tries to attack the group, forcing Nick to kill him. A huge number of crows then assault the plane, causing it to crash and killing everyone on board except for Jenny, who is parachuted off the plane by Nick.
Nick awakens a day later in a morgue in Oxford, discovering that he has been brought back to life by unknown means, and he learns from Vail's sardonic ghost that he has been cursed by Ahmanet, who seeks to use him as a replacement vessel for Set. Ahmanet's mummy escapes from the sarcophagus and begins feeding on rescue workers to regenerate her decomposed body. Turning the workers into zombie minions, she lures Nick and Jenny into a trap, forcing the two to fight off the minions as they unsuccessfully try to escape.
Ahmanet also recovers the Dagger of Set from a reliquary in a nearby church. At the last moment, however, unknown soldiers appear and subdue Ahmanet. Their leader, Dr. Henry Jekyll, explains that Jenny is an agent of Prodigium, a secret society dedicated to hunting supernatural threats. He reveals much of his own history and confirms that Nick was cursed when Ahmanet's tomb was opened. Although first welcoming Dr. Jekyll's help, Nick (as well as Jenny) become horrified to discover the doctor's intention to complete the ritual, allowing Set to possess Nick completely, in the belief that this will render Set vulnerable and allow his evil to be ended forever.
Meanwhile, Ahmanet summons a spider to possess a Prodigium technician and frees herself from captivity, wreaking havoc, death, and destruction in the process. After verbally sparring with Nick, Jekyll succumbs to his own dark impulses and transforms into Edward Hyde, his sadistic and murderous alternate personality, even as Ahmanet wreaks havoc outside unbeknownst to them. Nick rebuffs the repulsive Hyde's offer of an alliance between them, and Hyde attacks him. However, Nick manages to stop him with the serum Jekyll uses to suppress his evil side. He and Jenny then escape from Prodigium, but they run into Ahmanet once again. She steals back the dagger, summons an army of deceased crusaders to serve her, and creates a massive sandstorm that ravages London, with Nick and Jenny narrowly escaping her grasp. The undead knights slaughter the Prodigium soldiers in the tomb discovered during the film's opening, and Ahmanet finally recovers the ruby and places it in the dagger's pommel, granting her all that she needs to free Set aside from Nick himself.
Guided by the spectral Vail, Nick and Jenny flee into the London Underground tunnels, but it is revealed that Vail is still under Ahmanet's control and they are soon attacked by Ahmanet's minions. Ahmanet captures Jenny and drowns her, hoping to break her hold over Nick. Nick is beat up by Ahmanet until he gives up and lets himself embrace Ahmanet, using it as a ruse to steal the dagger and shatter the ruby. However, he sees the lifeless Jenny and bets on stabbing himself. Nick's body is partially possessed by Set, who proceeds to join Ahmanet to uphold his end of the bargain. However, looking back at Jenny's dead body, Nick regains control, using Set's powers to overpower and suck the life out of Ahmanet. Once Ahmanet is transformed back into a shriveled mummy, Nick harnesses Set's powers to resurrect Jenny, saying goodbye before succumbing to Set's nature and disappearing. Soon, Jenny regroups with Dr. Jekyll, and they tensely discuss if Nick, now fused with Set in an uncertain way, will use his powers for good, evil, or something else entirely. Ahmanet's corpse is lowered into a locked pool of mercury within the Prodigium base for safekeeping. Meanwhile, in the desert, Nick resurrects Vail, and the two set out on a new adventure."
It Comes at Night,"A highly contagious outbreak has ravaged the world. Paul, his wife Sarah, and their teenage son Travis have secluded themselves in their home deep in the woods in an undisclosed location. When Sarah's father, Bud, contracts the disease, they kill him and burn his body in a shallow grave. The next night, they capture an intruder breaking into the house. Paul ties him to a tree and places a bag over his head overnight to confirm he is not suffering from the disease. The stranger, Will, explains that he did not know the house was occupied and was only searching for fresh water for himself, his wife, and his young son. Will offers to trade some of their supply of food for water. Sarah suggests bringing Will's family back to their home, reasoning that the more people they have with them, the easier it would be to defend themselves should anyone else discover their location. Paul agrees, and he takes Will to collect his family. Along the way, they are ambushed by two men. Paul kills them and accuses Will of having set him up. Will points out that he fought them as well and assuages Paul's mistrust.
A few days later, Paul returns along with Will, his wife Kim, and son Andrew. After establishing the rules that Paul and Sarah have used to stay safe, including keeping the only entrance locked with a key Paul or Sarah wear around their neck, and keeping nighttime excursions to a minimum, the two families begin to establish a sense of normality and grow closer to each other. One day, Travis's dog Stanley begins barking aggressively at and chases an unseen presence in the woods. Travis follows the dog deeper into the woods before Stanley's barking suddenly ceases. Travis insists to Paul and Will that he heard something in the woods. They decide to return home, as Paul insists Stanley knows the woods and will find his own way home. That night, Will seemingly contradicts a story he had told Paul earlier about what he and Kim were doing prior to finding the abandoned house. Paul's response suggests an increasing level of distrust of Will.
That evening, Travis is awakened by a nightmare about his grandfather. He discovers Andrew sleeping on the floor of Bud's old room, also suffering from a nightmare. Travis leads him back to his parents' room before hearing a sound from downstairs. Investigating, Travis finds that the front door of the house is slightly opened. He wakes Paul and Will, who investigate further and find a bleeding and gravely sick Stanley lying on the floor. They kill and burn the dog. When Travis reveals that the door was already open when he came downstairs, Sarah suggests that a sleepwalking Andrew might have opened the door. Kim argues the possibility, and as tensions between the two families begin to rise, Paul decides that they should isolate themselves in their own rooms for a couple of days so that they can calm down and ensure no one is infected.
The next morning, Travis overhears a distraught Kim telling Will that they need to leave. Travis informs his parents that Andrew might be infected and, as such, he may be infected himself. Paul and Sarah don protective masks and gloves and take weapons to confront Kim and Will, fearing that they may steal their food and water, or return later by force. When Paul asks to be let in to see if Andrew is sick, Will draws a gun and takes Paul captive. Will insists that his family is healthy and demands Paul give him a fair share of food and water so that they can leave. Paul and Sarah overwhelm Will and force him and his family outside. Will and Paul get into a brutal fight before Sarah shoots Will, who dies from his wound. Kim flees into the woods with Andrew. Paul fires after them, killing Andrew. Kim hysterically begs Paul to kill her to end her misery, and he does. Travis's nose begins bleeding, and he later spots other signs of illness in the mirror.
Later, Travis awakens in bed, visibly sick. His mother comforts him as he dies. Some time later, Paul and Sarah sit at the dinner table in silence. They share a shattered, devastated look as the film ends."
My Cousin Rachel,"After the young boy Philip is orphaned, he is adopted by his older cousin Ambrose, who raises him as a son on his large estate in Cornwall. Despite societal beliefs of the necessity of motherhood, Philip grows up with a nearly complete absence of women in the household, before Ambrose leaves the estate for the sunnier climate of Florence. A young man, Philip is left with his godfather Nick Kendall, and learns through correspondence that Ambrose has met his widowed cousin Rachel in Florence, and they have wed. The Kendalls express surprise that Ambrose has become interested in women, though Philip found the absence of female companionship natural. Later, Ambrose begins sending letters indicating distrust of the medical care he is receiving in Florence. Concerned, Philip travels to Italy, only to be informed Ambrose has died and Rachel has left. Though Ambrose's will left the entire estate to Philip pending his next birthday, Philip is convinced Rachel is guilty of murder and threatens her friend Rinaldi with revenge.
Philip returns to Cornwall, and later learns Rachel has followed. She arrives at the estate, and while he vows to confront her, he meets her in the boudoir and is infatuated by the older woman's beauty as they share tea. They accompany each other on riding excursions, and no longer suspecting her of foul play, he throws an accusatory letter on a campfire. The two cousins conflict over Rachel's intentions to return to Florence and live independently, but Rachel indicates she is not angry with him, and they kiss. Rachel also reveals Ambrose had lost hope for her after a miscarriage. She stays for Christmas celebrations, when Nick receives bank information that she has drastically overdrawn her accounts. Nick warns Philip that Rachel was notorious in Florence for extravagance and lust. Despite this, Philip intends to turn over much of the estate's wealth to Rachel, as soon as he can legally dispose of it on his next birthday. The day arrives, and when Rachel realizes what he has done for her, she expresses gratitude. While out in nature, the two have sex. At a dinner with friends, Philip declares he and Rachel are engaged, but Rachel accuses him of madness. In private, she tells him she was merely thankful to him, but she was not bought and is not ashamed of having sex. This leads to a struggle, after which Rachel professes fear of him.
Sometime after, Philip falls ill. As he recovers, he is suspicious of Rachel, and watches her as she leaves on horseback. He and Nick's daughter Louise begin searching through Rachel's belongings for any incriminating evidence, only to find out she apparently is innocent of an affair and the poisoning attempts Philip blames on her. When he sets out in search of Rachel, he finds she has had a fatal accident while riding, on a cliffside. Years later, Philip, by then married to Louise and a father of two, is still, mentally and physically, tormented by Rachel's memory."

Next, she is shown waking up, taking care of her animals, and heading off to work at a massage therapy center where she meets with her clients. She then drives to the house of a client, Kathy (Connie Britton), to give her a massage before her dinner party. During the massage, Beatriz tells Kathy that her neighbor had killed one of her goats and becomes emotional. Beatriz leaves and heads to her car, but is unable to start it. She tells Kathy that a friend will repair it when he gets out of work. Kathy invites Beatriz to stay for the dinner party. Kathy checks with her husband Grant (David Warshofsky), who objects because they are entertaining important business connections, but he ultimately agrees.
The first dinner guests, Shannon (Chloë Sevigny) and Alex (Jay Duplass), arrive, discussing how much money they will make off their business venture. Beatriz explores the house, meets them, and awkwardly introduces herself.

She drops the knife and walks outside, back to the tow truck. As they are driving next to the ocean, she demands the tow truck driver pull over. She descends over rocks to the beach, walks into the ocean and submerges under water, reawakening in her boat on the mangrove swamp of the film's opening, revealing that the opening sequence is actually a reference to the final one where her murdered goat has gone and where she has now ""swum"" to."
Cars 3,"Lightning McQueen, now a seven-time Piston Cup racing legend, and the other veterans of the Piston Cup, suddenly find themselves being displaced by the next-generation rookies such as Jackson Storm, outfitted with the latest technology to break speed records. As the season progresses, the amount of new racers begin to increase, resulting in many veterans either retiring, or being fired by their sponsors, to make way for the new generation. Then, in the last race of the season, McQueen is badly damaged in a rollover crash while trying to catch up to Storm and did not finish the race.
Four months later, while recovering in Radiator Springs, McQueen isolates himself from his friends and spends his time watching footage of his late mentor, Doc Hudson, whose career ended in a similar accident, which McQueen fears that he might meet the same fate. After receiving some encouragement from his girlfriend, Sally, McQueen decides to continue racing and call his sponsors from Rust-eze, Rusty and Dusty, who surprise him by telling him they opened a new state-of-the-art training center known as the Rust-eze Racing Center, only to reveal that they have sold the team to a new owner, Sterling. There, McQueen meets Sterling, and is assigned to train under Cruz Ramirez. McQueen becomes impatient with Cruz's methodical approach to training, and he attempts to use a high tech racing simulator - only to end up damaging it. Sterling decides that McQueen is unfit to race, and instead, plans to use him for promotional materials only. McQueen contests this, and instead, makes a deal; if he should win the first race of the season, he will get to determine when he retires, otherwise he will retire on the spot. Sterling accepts the deal, but assigns him to work one-on-one with Cruz.
McQueen tries to train on the nearby Fireball Beach in order to build up his speed, but he finds most of his time spent on teaching Cruz how to drive on various terrain. McQueen then attempts to race at a dirt track called Thunder Hollow, and inadvertently ends up competing in a demolition derby called ″Crazy Eight″ that Cruz wins, and her elation leads to McQueen's humiliation. Angry at Cruz for apparently wasting time training him, McQueen rages at her. Upset, Cruz admits that she had wanted to be a professional racer like McQueen her whole life because he inspired her, but never started a race due to feeling intimidated and outclassed. She resigns as McQueen's trainer, and heads back to the training center.
Guilty and with no other options, McQueen calls up his friend Mater, who suggests that he should talk to Doc's mentor, Smokey in Doc's hometown of Thomasville. McQueen catches up to Cruz, and convinces her to rejoin him. In Thomasville, McQueen meets up with Smokey, who recounts how, despite his forced retirement, Doc found a new happiness in training McQueen. After McQueen accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and his friends help McQueen learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage with Cruz as his sparring partner. However, during the last practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes him, giving him a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence.
At the race in Florida, McQueen is coached by Smokey from the pits, and manages to gradually push up through the ranks. Sterling, who still believes McQueen cannot win, orders Cruz back to the center, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. McQueen overhears this, and remembers Cruz's speech about wanting to be a racer. He devises a plan; the next time he pits, he tells his crew to outfit Cruz in his racing number to try and finally beat Storm, against Sterling's wishes. Cruz is initially shaken by her lack of confidence, but Smokey and McQueen help her to pull ahead. On the last lap, Cruz catches up to Storm. Storm, feeling threatened, tries to intimidate her - even to the point of ramming her against the wall, but she uses one of Doc's tricks to repel off it, take the lead, and win.
As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer made by Tex Dinoco. Sterling reminds McQueen about his bet, but then McQueen's name is shared with Cruz's on the leaderboard as victors, since both he and Cruz raced with the winning number, thus winning the deal. Tex then goes to speak with Sterling, offering a deal. Sometime later, McQueen and Cruz return to Radiator Springs, decked out in Doc's old color and number, respectively. McQueen reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling, and McQueen decides to continue racing, and to be Cruz's crew chief.
In the post-credits scene, Mater at his junkyard tries to answer an incoming call from his phone. Somehow he accidentally touches his reception antenna and his phone goes dead much to his dismay."
Rough Night,"In 2006, four friends, Jess (Scarlett Johansson), Alice (Jillian Bell), Frankie (Ilana Glazer) and Blair (Zoë Kravitz), bond during their first year of college at George Washington University. A decade later they reunite as Jess is about to get married to her fiancé Peter (Paul W. Downs), and Alice decides that the four should spend the weekend in Miami partying. By this point, Alice is a teacher, Frankie is an aspiring activist with two strikes on her record, Blair is a real estate agent in the middle of a bitter divorce who still has conflicting feelings over her past relationship with Frankie, and Jess is an aspiring senatorial candidate whose campaign is hampered by the fact that the general public do not find her relatable despite her policies focusing on helping others.
Once in Miami, the four are joined by Pippa (Kate McKinnon), Jess's friend from her semester in Australia. The friends get high and party at a club and then Frankie decides to hire a male stripper, Jay (Ryan Cooper). When Jay arrives at the door, he makes Jess uncomfortable with his rough talk. Alice decides to take a turn and jumps on him, causing them to both fall and Jay to hit his head on the edge of the fireplace, killing him. Before they decide what to do, Jess takes a call from Peter and mentions during her panic that her friends hired a stripper and she is confused, before Alice destroys her phone and Blair confiscates the others to prevent anyone making calls until they can determine their next move. Peter takes this to mean that Jess is leaving him and decides to race down to Miami to convince Jess to take him back.
The friends purchase a burner phone and call Blair's uncle (Peter Francis James), who is a lawyer. After telling him they moved the body, he tells them that, while they may have gotten away with accidental death if they had made the call immediately, they could face up to fifteen years in prison for tampering with the crime scene unless no body is found. The friends decide to dispose of the body by throwing it into the ocean. After doing so, they realize that their neighbors, Lea (Demi Moore) and Pietro (Ty Burrell), have a security camera that may have caught them. They send Blair to get the tape, as the pair had previously expressed interest in a ménage à trois with Blair, only to have her discover the cameras do not work after she has slept with them. By this point, the body has washed up on the shore and they must come up with a new plan to dispose of it.
A police officer, Scotty (Colton Haynes), knocks on their door and Frankie knocks him out after he gropes her, only for the friends to realize that he was the actual stripper they had ordered, leaving them to wonder who they killed. They use Scotty's car to try to dispose of the body again only to return home defeated after a car accident when the car goes over a speed bump too quickly. Then when Alice finds out Jess invited Frankie and Blair to a bridal shower over her, Jess verbally berates her for her obsessive clinginess and storms off to prepare for the consequences.
At this point, Detectives Frazier (Dean Winters) and Ruiz (Enrique Murciano) arrive and tell the women they are not in trouble, as the man they killed was a violent criminal who had been on the run from the police. As they interrogate the women, Pippa realizes that the detectives are actually the accomplices of the man they killed when she spots the TV displaying all three men as suspects in a jewelry robbery. Realizing that they are caught, Frazier and Ruiz tie the women and Scotty up and threaten to shoot them. Jess meanwhile has missed most of the drama due to being upstairs taking a shower in preparation for her mugshot. Realizing what has happened, she manages to subdue Frazier using hairspray and handcuffs when he comes up to search for the diamonds, and kills Ruiz as he prepares to kill Blair. Frazier returns, having freed himself from the toy handcuffs, only to be run over when Peter, high on the drugs he took to keep him awake on his roadtrip to Miami, crashes into the front of the house and kills him.
Jess reaffirms that she wants to marry Peter and the two wed that weekend. Frankie and Blair decide to reunite as a couple and Alice hooks up with Scotty. Pippa confirms that the police have excused them from all charges as their victims were all criminals, and the deaths can be excused as self-defense. Jess receives a call from her campaign manager revealing that these events have caused her approval rating to go up significantly with the voters after capturing dangerous criminals as well as her new reputation as a party girl has helped make her more relateable to voters.
In a post-credits scene, Jess and Peter drive Alice home after a night out. Alice enters her apartment and looks for something to eat. She pours pasta into a pan, and discovers that there are diamonds mixed in with the pasta—the same diamonds that Jay stashed in their house for safekeeping."

Although his music becomes popular, some songs' controversial lyrics cause tensions between him and his record producers. Tupac begins acting in movies such as Juice, as well as collaborating with performers including Biggie Smalls. He generates both praise and controversy.
Tupac finds himself beaten by police officers over jaywalking. Another time, after he and a friend intervene when two white off-duty officers men assault a black man, Tupac is arrested for shooting at the cops. Tupac develops a contentious relationship with drug dealer and music partner Nigel. In 1993, Tupac goes on trial for rape and harassment charges. On November 30, 1994, he is attacked by three men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios, is shot five times before the men flee, and is hospitalized. The following day, Tupac is found not guilty of rape, but found guilty of illegal touching, and sentenced to eighteen months in prison.
While in prison, Tupac hears Biggie's song ""Who Shot Ya?"", and interprets it as a diss track bragging about Biggie's alleged involvement in his shooting. Tupac, who is assaulted by two guards while in prison, eventually is released and signs to Death Row Records under Suge Knight. Tupac and label-mate Dr. Dre work on the hit song ""California Love"". He releases the track ""Hit Em Up"" as a response to ""Who Shot Ya?"" in which Tupac brags about supposedly having an affair with Biggie's wife Faith Evans. Tupac parts ways with Death Row to launch his own company. Later, Suge offers Tupac a chance to become partners, and Tupac agrees to head Death Row's East Coast operations.
On September 7, 1996, Tupac, Suge, and others are leaving the Mike Tyson vs. Bruce Seldon boxing match at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. They confront the gang member who had jumped a friend, and Tupac knocks him to the ground, leading to a free-for-all. Tupac stops by his hotel to change clothes, and tells Kidada he will return in an hour. With Suge in his car, Tupac is at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane when a Cadillac pulls alongside Tupac's BMW and shoots Tupac multiple times before fleeing the scene. Onscreen text states that Tupac died six days later at age 25. His murder remains unsolved."
47 Meters Down,"Lisa (Mandy Moore) and Kate (Claire Holt) are sisters on holiday in Mexico. Lisa's boyfriend broke up with her because ""she made the relationship boring"". Kate tries to cheer Lisa up and takes her out drinking and dancing at 1:00 am. The sisters meet a pair of local men at a bar and they convince them to go out with them on their boat to watch sharks from a diving cage. Lisa hesitates but Kate persuades her saying it would show Lisa's boyfriend that she isn't boring and make him regret breaking up with her.
The sisters arrive at the boat dock. At first sight, the boat is lackluster and Lisa is immediately wary of it and its owner, Captain Taylor. Upon meeting the girls, the captain asks if the sisters are experienced divers. Kate is a certified diver but Lisa is new to diving, so they lie and say they are both experienced. The dive cage is old and rusty and hangs from a thin chains from an old crane, adding further to Lisa's apprehensions.
As they reach the diving spot, Captain Taylor baits the sharks. Lisa is skeptical about the entire dive, but Captain Taylor dismisses her concerns. The locals dive first in the cage. Unbeknownst to everyone on the boat, the cable supporting the cage starts to fray. The men return to the surface and Captain Taylor prepares to send Lisa and Kate down. When Lisa and Kate are in the cage, the cable breaks and the cage sinks to the bottom, some 47 meters below the surface and out of communication range with the boat. Kate swims up seven meters to resume communications with Captain Taylor, who tells her Javier (Chris J. Johnson) will be coming down with a spare winch to pull them up. He also advises them to stay in the cage as the sharks are circling. Both women are quickly running out of air, but they wait in the cage until they see a torch in the distance. Thinking that Javier cannot see them, Lisa swims out to get him, as Kate's air is lower due to the previous swim. Lisa swims towards the light, close to the bottom to avoid shark attacks from the below. A shark tries to attack Lisa but she swims into a small grotto to avoid it. Continuing to go towards the light, she comes to a crevasse with no bottom in sight.
Swimming over the cliff towards the light she finds the torch but not Javier. While looking around, she gets confused about her distance from the cage and Kate. Just as Javier appears and attempts to usher her back towards safety, he is attacked and killed by a shark. Lisa takes Javier's spear gun and the spare winch, and swims back towards the cage. With the newly acquired torch as well as the spear gun, Lisa swims up and notifies Taylor to pull them up. Disaster strikes as they are being winched to safety: The replacement winch line also snaps and the cage sinks back to the bottom. The cage lands on Lisa's leg, pinning her down. Lisa and Kate panic as they realize they are now both out of options and air.
Kate swims back up to communication range to tell Taylor they are low on air and that Lisa is pinned down. Taylor sends some air tanks down and tells them the Mexican coast guard is an hour out. He also warns her that the second tank may cause nitrogen narcosis which can lead to hallucinations. Kate finds the air tanks just as her original tank runs empty. She also finds three flares to signal the coast guard.
As she returns to the cage, Kate is attacked and dragged away by a shark. Lisa, still pinned and running low on air, uses the spear from the spear gun to pull the tank towards her. In the process, the spear cuts her hand. She dons the new tank, and then hears Kate over the radio. Kate is injured and low on air, and her blood is attracting more sharks. Lisa says she will find her, and uses her BCD to lift up the cage, freeing her leg. After Lisa finds Kate, Taylor tells them the coast guard is still some time out and they need to get back in the cage. Lisa adamantly refuses due to the nature of Kate's wounds, and they decide to swim to the surface. As they swim to the surface, they use one of the three flares to scare the sharks. At the 20-meter mark, they are reminded by Taylor they must wait five minutes to decompress and avoid the bends. As the first flare burns out, Kate tries to light the second flare but drops it and it sinks to the bottom. As she lights the third flare she sees 3 sharks close in front of her. The sisters are now surrounded by sharks and must rush to the surface.
Taylor yells for them to drop their gear and make a break for the surface. They swim as fast as they can towards the surface close to the boat. As they cling to a life ring to get to the boat, one of the sharks bites Lisa's leg and pulls her back down into the water. Lisa hits the shark and gouges its eye out and the shark releases her. Captain Taylor and the other men pull Lisa and Kate onto the boat and begin administering first aid. However, as Lisa stares at her hand on the deck of the boat, she realizes she has been hallucinating due to nitrogen narcosis. She realizes she is still at the bottom with her leg pinned by the cage. She laughs and imagines that she is talking to Kate on the boat deck. The coast guard comes to rescue her and carries Lisa to the surface without Kate. Lisa, as she is slowly and cautiously being brought to the surface, comes out of her hallucination, and realizes her sister is not with her. She starts to cry and call out to Kate, who has been dead since the shark attacked and dragged her away."
The Book of Henry,"In a small suburban town in the Hudson Valley, 11-year-old boy genius Henry Carpenter and his younger brother Peter are being raised by their single mother Susan, a waitress who is working on writing children's picture books. Henry has used his intellect to invest successfully in the stock market, building up a very substantial nest egg for his family. Henry also protects Peter from a school bully and builds Rube Goldberg machines in their tree house. Henry and Susan are both fond of their next-door neighbor (and Henry's classmate), Christina Sickleman, who has recently become glum.
Henry sees Christina being abused by her stepfather, Glenn, the local police commissioner. Henry reports the abuse to social services and the school principal, Janice Wilder, but Glenn has connections throughout the local government, and Wilder is reluctant to challenge the commissioner without ""conclusive evidence"". Henry is unable to get the authorities to launch a serious investigation that would protect Christina. Henry tells his mother that when someone is in trouble, those who can help must take action. He develops a detailed plan to rescue Christina that he memorializes in a notebook. After a violent seizure, Henry is taken to the hospital, where he is diagnosed with a brain tumor and undergoes surgery. Anticipating his death, he tells Peter to give Susan the notebook. Days later, Henry dies in Susan's arms in the hospital.
Susan is distraught at Henry's death and has difficulty functioning, but when Peter gives her the notebook, she focuses on Henry's plan. Susan tries, but fails, to interest a nearby social services agency in opening an investigation. One night, from the window in Peter's bedroom, she sees Glenn in Christina's room and decides to carry out the plan. The notebook and an accompanying cassette tape describe a step-by-step plan to kill Glenn with a sniper rifle while covering Susan's tracks so that it will be impossible to trace the murder back to her. Susan's alibi is to be provided by executing the murder while both Christina and Peter are performing at a school talent show.
Susan slips away from the talent show and puts the plan into motion. As she is about to pull the trigger, however, she realizes that Henry's plan, though ingenious, is the construct of a child, and that she must act as an adult. She immediately confronts Glenn and tells him that she is going to expose him for what he has done to Christina. Glenn replies that everyone will believe him, not her, and he tells her that he is going to call his police chief to come and bring her in. At the same time, affected by Christina's dance performance at the talent show, Principal Wilder decides to follow through on the abuse accusation and contacts the authorities. Glenn returns home, calls his relative at Social Services, and learns that an investigation is being opened into his abuse of Christina. As the police arrive at his house, Glenn kills himself. Susan legally adopts Christina as her daughter. She also finishes writing one of her children's books, as Henry had urged her to do."
Transformers: The Last Knight,"In 484 AD, King Arthur and his knights battle against the Saxons. Elsewhere, Merlin approaches the Knights of Iacon, a group of Transformers hiding on Earth, to help win the war. They hand him an alien staff, before transforming together into Dragonstorm, warning Merlin that a great evil will come for the staff.
In the present, a year after the Hong Kong Uprising,[N 1] Optimus Prime crash-lands on Cybertron, and meets his alleged creator Quintessa. She blames Optimus for Cybertron's destruction and brainwashes him into helping to gain Merlin's staff, which can absorb Earth’s energy to restore their homeworld. Earth is revealed to be the slumbering Unicron, whose horns are emerging across the planet.
On Earth, Transformers remain unwelcome amongst humanity, apart from in Cuba, and are hunted by the Transformers Reaction Force (TRF), a paramilitary force formed from the fallen Cemetery Wind. Cade Yeager, an ally to the Autobots, helps hide refugees from the TRF in his remote junkyard. In the war-torn Chicago, Cade, Bumblebee, street-wise scavenger Izabella and her Transformer companions Sqweeks and Canopy help a group of children evade the TRF drones, but Canopy is killed. Cade receives a mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot knight and has a brief standoff with the TRF before heading back to his junkyard with Izabella and Sqweeks. Both Megatron and the American military become aware of the talisman’s value and power, reluctantly joining forces to obtain it. A group of Decepticon prisoners are released to aid in the mission.
The Decepticons and the TRF locate Cade's hideout thanks to a tracker that the TRF had planted on Bumblebee during the standoff. Cade, his assistant Jimmy, Izabella, and Sqweeks flee from the Decepticons and the TRF to an abandoned town where the Autobots ambush their enemies and defeat them while Cade, Jimmy, and Izabella battle a unit of TRF drones. Cogman, a steampunk Transformer, approaches Cade and invites him to travel to the United Kingdom and meet his employer, Sir Edmund Burton, who has connections to the Transformers. Burton also has his associate, Hot Rod, bring Viviane Wembley, a University of Oxford English Literature professor, to his estate.
Bringing Cade, Viviane, and Bumblebee together, Burton explains that Transformers have been aiding mankind in war for centuries, their existence hidden by a secret society of historical figures known as the Order of Witwiccans and that he is the last living member. The talisman can lead to Merlin’s staff, buried with him in a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden at the bottom of the sea. However, only a direct descendant of Merlin can wield it, revealing Viviane is the last in his bloodline. The TRF and the local authorities discover them, forcing them to flee. Following a series of clues while evading their pursuers, Cade, Viviane, Bumblebee, and Cogman commandeer the submarine HMS Alliance, which is revealed to be a Transformer, to find the spacecraft, followed by the TRF in their own submarines.
Burton later contacts Seymour Simmons, both learning that Earth is Unicron, and the staff will be used to drain the planet’s life, via an access point hidden under Stonehenge. Locating the ship, Cade and Viviane discover Merlin’s tomb and obtain the staff. Viviane activates it, causing the spacecraft to become airborne, awakening the Knights of Iacon. As the TRF try to take the staff from them, Optimus arrives, forcing them to surrender the staff. Bumblebee and Cade confront Optimus, the former speaking in his own voice, stirring Optimus' memories and freeing him from Quintessa's control. The Knights try to execute Optimus for his presumed betrayal, but Cade stops them when his talisman transforms into Excalibur and the Knights yield to him. The Autobots and human military forces then converge on Stonehenge. They then engage the Decepticons and Quintessa's minions, who either flee or are killed while Quintessa is seemly destroyed by Optimus and Bumblebee. The worlds are then saved upon Vivian removing the staff.
In a mid-credits scene, Quintessa, who has survived and is disguised as a human, approaches a group of scientists inspecting one of Unicron’s horns, offering a way to destroy him."
The Beguiled,"Martha Farnsworth runs a girls school in Virginia during the Civil War. By 1864, almost all of the students, teachers, and slaves have left; only five students and one teacher, Edwina Morrow, remain. While out in the woods searching for mushrooms, Amy, a pupil, comes across John McBurney, a corporal in the Union Army who was wounded in the leg during battle, and has since deserted. Amy brings McBurney to the school where he falls unconscious. The women lock McBurney in one of the rooms while Miss Farnsworth tends to his wounds. All the women and girls in the school are immediately fascinated by the handsome man.
Initially, some of the school's residents want McBurney to be delivered as a prisoner of war to the Confederate Army, but Miss Farnsworth decides that they will let his leg heal before they decide what they will do with him. When Confederate soldiers arrive at the school, Miss Farnsworth does not tell them that a Union soldier is on the premises. While McBurney is recovering, the women and girls fight for his affection by giving him presents, wearing jewellery, and preparing a lavish dinner for him. He returns the affection, concentrating especially on Miss Morrow and Miss Farnsworth. When he is able to move again, he begins to help in the garden. It becomes clear that he fears returning to battle.
When Miss Farnsworth indicates that McBurney is healthy enough and will have to leave the school in a few days, he tries to convince her to let him stay as a gardener, and tells Miss Morrow that he has fallen in love with her. One night, he tells Miss Morrow to await him in her room. When he does not appear and she hears strange noises, she investigates and finds him in bed with Alicia, a teenage pupil. McBurney tries to calm Miss Morrow down, but she pushes him away, causing him to fall down the stairs and badly break his already injured leg. Miss Farnsworth decides that the only way to stop him from dying is to amputate the leg.
When he awakes the next day and realizes he has lost his leg, McBurney is devastated and furious, accusing the women (and especially Miss Farnsworth) of having punished him for not choosing their rooms instead of Alicia's. He is locked up in his room but threatens Jane, who gets him the room key. He then breaks out, steals a gun, and threatens the women before storming off. Miss Morrow follows him to his room, where they have passionate sex.
Meanwhile Miss Farnsworth tries to find a solution. One of the students suggests killing McBurney by preparing him a dinner of poisonous mushrooms, to which Miss Farnsworth agrees. During the dinner, Miss Morrow, who is not informed of the plan, is deterred by the others at the last minute from putting the mushrooms on her own plate. McBurney's suspicions are not aroused; he eats the mushrooms. Seconds later, he falls to the floor, in the throes of death. While the others are sewing McBurney's body into a shroud, Miss Morrow looks on, devastated. The film ends with the women dragging McBurney's body to the road so that he will be found by the next Confederate soldiers who pass by."
The Big Sick,"Kumail is a comedian in Chicago trying to get his big break performing standup as well as a one-man show about his Pakistani background. His Muslim immigrant parents frequently set him up with young Pakistani women, expecting that he will follow their example of an arranged marriage; he is uninterested but tolerates the introductions. He also lets them believe he still shares their religious faith, though he has become agnostic.
During a standup show, Kumail is heckled by Emily, a white woman in the audience. He approaches her after the show and their one-night stand develops into a on-going relationship. Kumail does not tell his family about Emily, as they would disapprove, and his relationship with Emily is strained as he holds back, fearful of losing his family who disowned one of his cousins after he married a white woman. Emily finds pictures of the women Kumail's parents have set him up with; they argue and she asks whether he sees a long-term future with her, given his family's expectations. When he says he doesn't know, Emily ends their relationship.
Kumail learns weeks later that Emily has been taken to the hospital after having fainted. A doctor tells him that Emily has a serious lung infection and must be immediately placed in an induced coma with tracheal intubation. He signs the permission form and calls her parents, Beth and Terry. Aware of their daughter's messy breakup with Kumail, they tell him he is not needed, but Kumail stays and the three become close as they deal with Emily's illness.
Surgery is ineffective and the infection spreads to Emily's kidneys. Beth wants to transfer Emily to a different hospital, but Kumail and Terry disagree. Beth and Terry argue, and she brings up Terry's past. Terry stays at Kumail’s apartment where he reveals that he cheated on Beth and regrets it.
Kumail's parents visit his apartment, angry that he is not taking their marriage suggestions seriously. Kumail tells them that he does not want an arranged marriage and no longer practices Islam, and reveals his relationship with Emily. His parents disown him.
Moments before an audition for the Montreal Comedy Festival, Kumail learns that the infection has reached Emily's heart. Distraught on stage, Kumail spends the audition tearfully recounting his fears about Emily’s health, and fails the audition.
Emily wakes from her coma. The doctors explain she has adult-onset Still's disease, a rare and serious but treatable illness; Kumail inadvertently helped them diagnose her when he mentioned she had an ankle injury that was slow to heal. Still pained from their breakup, Emily tells Kumail to leave. Neverthless, Beth invites Kumail to Emily's homecoming party. Kumail asks Emily to take him back, but she refuses, reminding him that while he may have had a transformative experience during her illness, she was unconscious for duration and for her nothing had changed.
Kumail decides to move to New York City with two comedian friends. He tells his family about his plans and refuses to allow them to reject him. Emily discovers a video of Kumail's disastrous audition in which he spoke openly about his feelings for her and she goes to find him after his one-man show, saying she has something to tell him. But before she can, he tells her he is moving to New York City. He asks what she had wanted to tell him and she says only that she appreciates everything he did for her while she was in a coma and wishes him well in New York.
As Kumail prepares to depart for New York, his parents visit. His father tells him they are still angry, but gives him a dish of his favorite food and ask him to stay in touch. The film ends with Kumail performing in New York, where he is heckled by someone in the crowd; he sees that it is Emily."
The Bad Batch,"In an unspecified near future, a young woman named Arlen (Suki Waterhouse) is processed and dropped inside a fenced-in area outside of Texas where people being deemed undesirable by society (the ""bad batch"") are forced to live and fend for themselves as outcasts. A sign declares that the area is considered outside of the U.S. and that American laws and citizenship no longer apply. Shortly after, Arlen is attacked by two women in a golf cart. When she wakes, she finds herself chained up and realizes she has been captured by cannibals who remove first her right arm, then her right leg. Arlen eventually covers herself in feces, causing one of the cannibals to untie her so she can be washed, using this moment to attack and kill the woman and escape on a skateboard. She is picked up in the desert by the Hermit (Jim Carrey), a mute vagrant who takes her to a makeshift town named Comfort where she is cared for and given a prosthetic leg.
Five months later, a mostly healed Arlen heads out to the desert, where she sees a golf cart similar to the one owned by the cannibals who captured her. She finds a mother and daughter scavenging among waste. Realizing they are cannibals, Arlen shoots and kills the mother as a revenge for her ordeal. She takes the daughter back with her to Comfort, but is spotted by the Hermit. While there, she goes to a rave held by The Dream (Keanu Reeves), the cult-like leader of Comfort. Meanwhile, Miami Man (Jason Momoa), the father of the child she took, notices his daughter missing. The Hermit, in exchange for a portrait, tells Miami Man to ""find Comfort."" Arlen drops acid at the rave and wanders out into the desert, where she stumbles upon Miami Man, who recognizes her as someone from Comfort. Upon threat of death, he demands that she'll accompany him to Comfort, where she'll have access inside the town walls so she'll be able to retrieve his daughter.
Arlen and Miami Man grow closer on their journey to Comfort. He defeats another cannibal who's looking to eat her, and reveals that he was put into the lawless territory because he was an undocumented immigrant from Cuba. Before they arrive, Arlen is rescued by a man from Comfort, who shoots and wounds Miami Man and returns Arlen to the town. Feeling guilty, she begins to look for Miami Man's daughter. She eventually finds her living at The Dream's mansion. Arlen goes visit The Dream, who explains that Comfort runs on the drugs that his many concubines make. When Arlen offers to join his harem, he accepts her offer, but Arlen instead uses her concealed gun to hold one of the pregnant members of the harem hostage, this way managing to extract Miami Man's daughter. They head out of Comfort in a golf cart, and soon reunite with Miami Man, who has been rescued and healed by the Hermit. Arlen returns the child to Miami Man, and tells him she wants to stay with him. Miami Man tries to discourage her, deeming her unable to survive out in the desert roamed by cannibals; but he does not send Arlen away. Instead, he kills his daughter's pet rabbit, and the three sit down around a campfire eating it."
Baby Driver,"Baby is a getaway driver in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was a child, a car accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus, which he blocks out by listening to music on his iPod. He ferries crews of robbers assembled by Doc, a criminal mastermind, to pay off a debt he incurred after stealing one of Doc's cars. Between jobs, he creates remixes from snippets of conversations he records and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. At a diner, he meets a waitress, Debora, and they start dating.
Baby's next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. While Baby is on a date with Debora, Doc insists he join a heist at a post office, threatening to hurt Debora and Joseph if he refuses.
The crew consists of easy-going Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and trigger-happy Bats, who takes an immediate dislike to Baby. While the crew attempts to purchase illegal arms for the job, Bats recognizes one of the dealers as a policeman and opens fire. They kill all of the dealers. Afterward, Bats makes Baby stop at Debora's diner, unaware of Baby and Debora's romance. Baby, aware of Bats' homicidal habit, stops him from killing her to avoid paying.
Doc is furious, revealing that the dealers were dirty cops on his payroll. He decides to cancel the heist, but Bats, Buddy and Darling disagree. Doc lets Baby decide; he chooses to go through with it. Baby attempts to slip away late that night, hoping to take Debora and leave Atlanta. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is an informant; when they and Doc hear his mixtapes, they are convinced of his innocence.
During the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive away, causing Bats to hit him. Baby then rams the car into a rebar which impales Bats, killing him. The three flee on foot. After the police kill Darling in a shootout, Buddy blames Baby for her death and vows to kill him. Baby steals a car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home, Baby drives to Debora's diner to pick her up, where an armed Buddy is waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as the police close in.
Baby seeks help from Doc, who initially refuses to help. After seeing he truly loves Debora, Doc supplies them with cash and directions to get out of the country, stating that he was in love once. The police confront the three in the parking garage, but Doc kills them all. Buddy then ambushes them with a stolen police car and hits and kills Doc. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy. He shoots next to both Baby's ears, deafening him. Debora disarms Buddy with a crowbar and Baby shoots him in the leg, causing him to fall to his death.
Fleeing Atlanta, Baby and Debora run into a police roadblock. Baby surrenders, telling Debora she does not belong in the world of crime. At Baby's trial, Joseph, Debora, and several people Baby saved/helped during the robberies testify for him. Baby is sentenced to 25 years in prison, with a parole hearing after five. He receives postcards from Debora, who promises to wait for him. When Baby is eventually released, he finds Debora waiting for him."
Okja,"In 2007, self-defined environmentalist Lucy Mirando becomes CEO of the Mirando Corporation, succeeding her controversial grandfather, her father and her cruel twin sister Nancy. She announces that they have been breeding a special kind of “super pig”. The twenty-six produced specimens are sent to as many farmers in different locations around the world, and ten years later, one of them will be crowned the winner of a competition to breed the best pig.
In 2017, a young girl named Mija lives in the countryside of South Korea with her grandfather and their super pig, Okja. They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox, who declares Okja the best super pig and announces they will take her to New York City. Mija's grandfather presents her with a gold pig and explains to her that he saved up money to buy the solid gold item to replace Okja when she was taken away. Devastated, Mija runs away to Seoul to find Okja, where she sees her as she is being loaded onto a truck. Mija chases down the truck but it is intercepted by another truck, run by the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). In the resulting chaos Mija and Okja run away but are eventually saved by the ALF, led by Jay. Recognizing that Mija is Okja's owner, Jay uses another ALF member, K, as a translator to tell Mija that their plan is to put a recording device in Okja's ear and let her be re-captured by the Mirando corporation to show how brutally they treat their animals. Mija tells them to return her to the mountains but K deliberately lies, leading the group to believe Mija is in agreement with their plan. They abandon her, and Okja is recaptured.
Meanwhile, footage of Okja and Mija running through the streets of Seoul has gone viral. To minimise the damage, Lucy pays for Mija to come to New York in an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 to be reunited onstage with her pig. Okja is taken to a laboratory in Paramus, New Jersey where she is forcibly bred with another super pig and bits of meat are extracted from her flesh for a taste test. Members of the ALF overhear the recording through the device they placed in Okja's ear. After the ALF see the forced breeding, K reveals he lied to the rest of the group about Mija's support of the plan in order to continue the mission. In response, Jay attacks K, and expels him from the ALF.
In New York City, Mija is forced to agree to the wishes of the Mirando corporation. Jay slips into her room and tells her that they still plan to rescue Okja while on stage. A parade is put on by the Mirando Corporation, who give out free meat in the street. Mija is reunited with Okja who, blinded and battered does not recognize her and attacks. In the resulting chaos, Jay tries to hurt Okja, but Mija prevents him from doing so, calming Okja down so that she recognizes Mija. A video of the mistreatment of Okja is screened by the ALF to the public, who quickly turn on the Mirando Corporation. Mija and the ALF attempt to escape with Okja but fail. Okja is recaptured and the ALF members are arrested. Nancy, having returned to control the company, closes the lab, scraps all of Lucy's promotional marketing, and starts full-time operations at their slaughterhouse. Jay and Mija are rescued by K, who had 'translations are sacred' tattooed on his arm.
Jay and K take Mija to find Okja in a mass slaughterhouse. The group search for Okja but are unable to find her until Mija sees her going up the ramp to the slaughterhouse. In order to save Okja, she runs through the killing plant and sees many dead super pigs. Mija sees Okja as she is about to be slaughtered and shows the Mirando employee a photograph of herself with a baby Okja. Nancy arrives and tells Mija that Okja must be slaughtered. Mija offers the golden pig to Nancy in exchange for Okja's life. Nancy agrees to the deal whilst subsequently having Jay and K arrested. As Mija and Okja are leaving, they see many more pigs being led to slaughter. A pair of superpigs manages to push their newborn through the fence, and Okja hides it within her mouth to take it away.
Back in the countryside, Mija resumes her life with her grandfather, Okja, and the new piglet. In a post-credits scene, Jay is released from prison and gets on board a bus with K and the other members of the organization. With their newest member Kim Woo-shik, a former driver for Mirando Corporation, they plan to disrupt a major meeting involving all of the Mirando shareholders."

The next day, Agnes and Edith set out into the woods to track the mythical unicorn, only to find a one-horned goat whom Agnes adopts and dubs ""Lucky"". Meanwhile, the Minions' longing for Gru motivates them to escape from prison and return to their former master.
Dru convinces Gru to steal the diamond, with Gru secretly intending to bring it to the AVL, which he hopes will convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy. Despite several setbacks, they manage to retrieve the diamond and are rescued by Lucy after narrowly escaping. After finding out Gru's true motives, Dru confronts his brother about his lie. In return, Gru insults him and decides to leave Freedonia, ending their relationship. Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the children, and once again acquires the diamond. Gru and Dru resolve their differences and pursue him after finding the real Lucy.
With his robot powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, intending to send it into space with the use of superpowered gum. Lucy saves the children while Gru and Dru weaken Bratt's robot with the weapons of their father's car. Gru is knocked unconscious when the car is destroyed, and Dru manages to destroy the robot's core from the inside when Bratt threatens to kill Gru. When Gru recovers, he battles Bratt in a dance fight, using it as a distraction to grab his weaponized keytar, and defeats him. Having rendezvoused with Gru, the Minions manage to destroy the gum already covering the city, and Gru and Dru reunite.
Soon afterward, Gru and Lucy are reinstated in the AVL and the newly united family celebrate in Gru's home. Lucy is acknowledged by the children as their mother. Lured back to villainy, Dru, along with most of the Minions, steals Gru's airship, with Gru's emblem replaced with a ""D"" graffiti. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging pursuit."
The House,"During their visit to Bucknell University, husband and wife Scott (Ferrell) and Kate Johansen (Poehler) warn their daughter of the dangers of being in college. Alex (Simpkins) acknowledges her parents' warnings and expresses her interest in attending the same University her parents went to. Alex gets accepted to the University, which the Johansens expect to be funded by their community's scholarship program.
Unfortunately during a community town hall meeting, city councilor Bob Schaeffer (Kroll) announces that they will not be doing the scholarship program in favor of building a community pool, to which everyone but the Johansens agrees. The Johansens try to find funding through asking for a loan, a salary raise for Scott, and getting Kate's job back, but are denied. They reluctantly agree to go with their friend and neighbor, Frank Theodorakis (Mantzoukas), who is going through a divorce with wife Raina (Watkins) due to his gambling and porn addiction to a previously planned trip to Las Vegas. After numerous wins playing craps they lose their winnings after Scott jinxes the table by telling Frank not to roll a seven.
Back home, Frank convinces the Johansens to start an underground casino in his own house to raise money for their daughter's tuition and to help him get his wife back. The casino operation proves to be running smoothly as they gain more customers. In another community town hall meeting, Bob becomes suspicious, as there are only a few attendees, and suspends the meeting until after launching an investigation. Back to the Johansens' casino, Frank discovers that one of the gamblers, Carl (Zissis), is counting cards. The Johansens and Frank confront him, but he brags that he works for mob boss Tommy Papouli (Renner). Scott accidentally chops off Carl's middle finger, earning him the nickname ""The Butcher"", and makes the community afraid of him, which inadvertently increases their profits.
Several thousand dollars away from reaching their goal, they are caught by Bob and officer Chandler (Huebel), who confiscate their money and order them to close down the casino. Nonetheless, they continue their business. The house burns down after being invaded by Tommy Papouli, whom the Johansens accidentally set on fire. Having admitted their plot to Alex, they team up with officer Chandler, who had let them loose, to steal the money back from Bob. Officer Chandler convinces Bob that the three still continued the casino even after he had ordered them to stop and shows a video of the people mocking him. Bob asks Officer Chandler to go with him to arrest the Johansens at the casino, which gives the Johansens the chance to steal their money back. Dawn (Tolman) alerts Bob that the Johansens are in the town hall, which convinces Bob to go back. Bob tries to make Officer Chandler drive faster, but gets into an accident himself. Bob runs back on foot to the town hall to find the Johansens with the money. After chasing the Johansens, Bob reveals his personal interest with the casino money as well as his plot to steal money from the city budget for himself and Dawn, who leaves him and returns to her husband (Scovel). Bob is arrested, while Scott and Kate use the money they took back from him to pay for their daughter's college tuition."
The Little Hours,"In the year 1347 in Garfagnana, a convent of nuns is led by Father Tommasso. The nuns include Alessandra, who wants a better life for herself and is held at the convent due to her father's support of the church rather than her own bidding; Ginevra, a gossip who is later revealed to be a lesbian and Jewish; and Fernanda, an emotionally unstable and violent woman. The three of them routinely assault the gardener, who quits in disgust. Meanwhile in Lunigiana, a young servant named Massetto gets caught having sexual relations with his master's wife. While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him get back home. The two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a deaf-mute, in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble. Alessandra and Fernanda both end up having sex with Massetto. Massetto and Alessandra begin to form a closer bond while Ginevra begins to have feelings for Fernanda.
Later, Fernanda kidnaps Massetto at knife-point and takes him into the forest, where she meets up with a coven of witches. She attempts to perform a fertility ritual with Massetto but is stopped by the arrival of Alessandra and Ginevra. Ginevra, under the hallucinogenic effects of belladonna, takes off her clothes and begins dancing and steals the convent's donkey. Massetto reveals that he is not a deaf-mute while trying to free himself. They return to the convent, and all of their secrets are revealed in the presence of the visiting Bishop Bartolomeo. Father Tommasso is sent away to become a monk after it is discovered that he and the Mother Superior are in love and have a secret relationship. Massetto is returned to his master and is held in a jail cell with the impending threat of torture and death until the three nuns (who have reconciled and formed an even stronger friendship) help him escape. While Alessandra, Massetto, Ginevra, and Fernanda each run hand-in-hand back to the convent, the Mother Superior and Father Tommasso have met up in secret under the pretense that the Mother Superior has gone to retrieve the donkey. They hide as the nuns and Massetto run by. Fernanda stops and stares in puzzlement at the once again freed donkey that she herself used as an excuse so many times to escape the convent, until Ginevra pulls her away. With the group gone, Father Tommasso and Mother Superior embrace and smile at each other."
Inconceivable,"While holding a crying baby, a woman fights with and kills a man, presumably her husband. Four years later, Angela (Gina Gershon) and Brian (Nicolas Cage) have a four-year-old daughter named Cora. The three are a happy, close family. Both are doctors, though Angela is on leave to be a full-time mom. A friend of Angela's, Linda, introduces Angela to Katie. Katie's four-year-old daughter Maddie hits it off with Cora. Katie says she left an abusive husband but does not elaborate. She also refuses to have her photo taken. Brian's mother, Donna, (Faye Dunaway) dislikes Katie from the start and questions her background, sensing something is off about her.
Angela confides to Katie she had trouble conceiving so she used an egg donor for Cora and is now pregnant again. Devastated after a miscarriage, she invites Katie to move into the guest house and be a part-time nanny while she recovers. One night, knowing Brian is watching, Katie steps naked into the pool. Brian becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Angela returns to work at the hospital part-time to give her more of a purpose, and Katie watches Cora.
Katie uses her free time in the house to go snoop through Angela and Brian's belongings, envious of their family. Angela comes home after work one day and catches Katie having sex in the guest house with whom she thinks is Brian, but is actually a woman (later revealed to be Linda). After the initial embarrassment, Angela relaxes somewhat and trusts Katie more, not believing she would ever have any interest in Brian. Linda excitedly tells Katie that Angela is going to ask Linda to be their surrogate, but Katie can barely hide how it upsets her.
Apparently Angela has one embryo left from the same donor that Cora was conceived from, and she wants to use that so the two can be full siblings. Katie confides to Linda that she is the donor, and that her daughter Maddie was also hers but born from a mother in Maine. Katie abducted Maddie as a baby because ""the mother didn't take care of her"" and now she worries that Cora is not getting enough attention either and wants to take her. She drowns Linda in a lake, and a couple later finds her body.
Four months later, Katie is carrying Angela and Brian's baby (and unknown to them, her own baby). Donna asks Angela what Katie get out of it. Angela says Katie will be paid forty thousand dollars and that she does not expect anything else. It is revealed in a flashback that Katie, whose real name is Tara, can no longer have her own children. As Katie's behavior gets stranger and more delusional – Angela catches Katie lying to a mother in a park about both girls being her twin daughters – Angela becomes more suspicious. Brian says everything will be fine when the baby comes, after which Katie will move on with her life.
A couple months later, Angela and Brian tell Katie they are getting a full-time nanny, and Katie angrily accuses them of wanting a complete stranger to raise their child. Brian defends her and says she just has different beliefs than them. It becomes clear that Angela and Brian are not as happy any more. Angela suspects Katie is planning to keep the baby and disappear, and accuses her of killing Linda because she wanted it for herself. Katie fakes early labor pains. Brian is furious with Angela and thinks she is taking meds and losing her mind.
The next morning, while Brian is at work, and Katie is sleeping in the girl's bed in the main house, Angela sneaks into the guest house to snoop and discovers Katie's secrets, confirming that she is mentally ill and she was a previous donor. Angela gets a DNA test for the girls but realizes that Katie has drugged her and rushes home, where she confronts Katie. Katie admits everything and stabs herself in the stomach, possibly harming the baby. Katie says she will tell everyone that Angela tried to kill her.
Katie is taken to the ER and an emergency C-section takes place. A healthy baby boy named Gabriel is born. But what is later revealed is that the DNA test came back and showed that Maddie and Cora were related to each other and to Katie, meaning Angela had told the truth. It is also revealed that she killed Maddie's parents before abducting her and claiming her as her own. In the end, Katie is locked up and Angela, Brian, Maddie, Cora and baby Gabriel are a happy family."
2:22,"The movie starts with Dylan Branson (Michiel Huisman) having a dream about a murder at the Grand Central Train Station that feels very real. He wakes with a start and progresses with his routine while watching news about a star called Hamlin that died 30 years ago, but its light is reaching the Earth 30 years later and that this supernova will have effects on the Earth and its inhabitants. Dylan is an air traffic controller who possess a unique ability to visualize patterns.
Dylan is shown on his way to work, riding a bike and heading to the Grand Central Station to take the train. After work, he goes to a club drinking with his co-workers and receives a ticket to an aerial ballet as a gift for his upcoming birthday. The following day at exactly 2:22pm, his world stops after he almost causes a midair collision of the two aircraft, resulting in him being suspended from his job.
The day after he was suspended, he attends the aerial ballet and meets Sarah (Teresa Palmer). They go to a restaurant and start talking, Dylan tells Sarah that his father was a pilot and that he also trained to be a pilot but could never become one as he was afraid of flying. Sarah tells him that she works at the Howard Pace Art Gallery. He also tells her about his being suspended from work, and he finds out that Sarah was on the plane that almost collided with the other aircraft at 2.22pm. Dylan felt apologetic about the incident, but Sarah was instead thankful towards Dylan for saving her life. As they depart, they admit to each other that for a ""first date"" they felt a deep connection and it felt like they had known each other forever.
The following day, while on the way to the Grand Central Dylan, notices the same happenings (siren, woman laugh, construction sound, ""Can I help you with"", glass breaking) and at 2:21 PM, he hears the announcement of the boarding of the Millhurst express, sees a businessman reading his newspaper, a couple hugging each other, a line of preschoolers where the last child in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clock. At exactly 2:22 PM, the window of the station shatters. He goes to meet Sarah and asks her out to an early dinner, going to the Central Park with her. Sarah tells Dylan that she was a ballet dancer student before she landed awkwardly and tore two of her knee ligaments. Cheering her up, Dylan create an improvised speaker using a paper cup and ice cream cone holder, lifting Sarah's mood,they then dance and kiss. They go to Dylan's apartment and make love. The next morning, Dylan asks Sarah where she got her necklace from, to which Sarah replies that it was from her ex-boyfriend; Jonas (Sam Reid) who happens to be the main artist of the gallery at which she works. Dylan asks when is Sarah's birthday and they find out that both of them were born on the same day; April 18, 1986 and they are both turning 30 within a weeks time. Dylan suddenly hears a car crash on the road below his apartment at exactly 9:15 AM and he tells Sarah that it was 3rd day in a row that the same incident had happened.
Dylan takes a cab with a reckless driver going to Grand Central, as the driver take the shorter route Dylan tells him to stop the cab and notices again the same pattern of siren, a woman laugh, construction sounds, and a man saying ""Can I help you with"". Dylan then shouts for the cab to stop and this infuriates the cab driver, who turns around to tell Dylan off for shouting at him. Just then, another car hits them both, causing the breaking of the cab's glass windows. Even though Dylan is injured, he goes to the Grand Central Station and sees exactly the same pattern of events. He tells Sarah of these repeating patterns, but with different people carrying out the same actions. Sarah does not believe Dylan, but helps to clean his wounds from the car accident. Dylan goes home and starts writing all the events of his day starting from 9:10 AM (water drop, a bug dying, a plane flying overhead etc.) and realizes that everything has a pattern that's repeating itself.
Dylan goes to the gallery looking for Sarah, and realises that the gallery was having an exhibition with Jonas' art piece as the main exhibition. Jonas has created a light hologram exhibition about the Grand Central Station, and Dylan sees that it is exactly like the events that he has experienced the past few days (announcement of the boarding of Millhurst Express, a business man reading his newspaper, a couple embracing each other, a line of preschooler where the last in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clocks). Dylan assumes that Jonas is stalking him as only Dylan knows about these events.He attacks Jonas resulting in a brawl and questions Jonas on whether he was stalking him. In the audience is the owner of the Keifer Gallery and he applauds saying it was a great idea to enact the murder at the Grand Central Station that happened 30 years ago and that he has an exhibit related to it at his gallery. Sarah apologises to Jonas about Dylan's attack and puts her relationship with Dylan on hold.
Later that night, Dylan texts Sarah to beg for her forgiveness. In the mean time, he finds a stack of envelope hidden in his home. He finds out Jake Redman (Duncan Ragg) has written these letters to a woman named Evelyn. Upon investigation, Dylan finds out that Jake was a criminal although he was never convicted for his crimes as the police could not find enough evidence to pin him down, while Evelyn was a singer, and they both were lovers. Dylan also finds an article online stating that Jack had shot Evelyn and another policeman, Noah (Jack Ellis), down in the Grand Central Station in a fit of jealous rage before being gunned down by other policemen on 18 April 1986, which was the day both Dylan and Sarah were born.
Dylan then visits Evelyn's sister, and she gives Dylan a stack of letters that Jack wrote to Evelyn as she could never bear to read them and shows him the necklace she is wearing saying that it was all she needs to remember her. The necklace is identical to the one that Dylan had seen Sarah wear. She also tells him that Noah; the policeman was taking Evelyn to Millhurst to keep her safe from Jake and that it seemed that he was also in love with Evelyn. Noah goes to the Grand Central Station to buy a ticket for the Millhurst Express, but is told that the service was terminated 30 years ago and now the train is known as the Poughkeepsie Express. At exactly 2:22 PM the chandelier crashes to the floor.
Dylan connects the dots and realises that Dylan was Jake in his past life, while Sarah was Evelyn, and that he would kill her at Grand Central Station on their birthday, 18 April at 2:22 PM. He realises that the pattern of events that has been happening was leading up to the day they both would die. He tells Sarah this and she does not believe him. As she tries to calm Dylan down, Dylan insists that they both should break up as he would soon kill Sarah, which he does not want to as he knows that they are soul mates.
Dylan contemplates suicide, which was unsuccessful, while a distraught Sarah looks for Jonas in his apartment. Jonas offers to bring Sarah to Millhurst to help her feel better about the breakup. The next day, both Jonas and Sarah's flight to Millhurst gets canceled and they have to go to Grand Central Station to take a train there. Meanwhile, Dylan looks for Sarah and in the midst of it, he breaks into Jonas' apartment and sees that Jonas recognises Sarah as Evelyn in his past life and that he was Noah. Dylan figures out that Jonas/Noah is obsessed with Sarah/Evelyn and that Jonas/Noah had a gun with him and races to the Grand Central Station to see her. On his way he attracts the attention of the police and leads them there.
At the Grand Central Station, Sarah realises that the patterns Dylan saw were true and she tries to leave but is stopped by a crazed Jonas calling her Evelyn. He wants Sarah to admit that she loves him, while Sarah refuses just as Dylan arrives at the Station. Jonas thinking that Sarah called him there gets enraged and makes his way towards Dylan with a gun while Sarah sees the events unfold as Dylan had described them to her, and realises that she is the pregnant woman standing under the clock.Jonas first points his gun towards Dylan and then Sarah saying that ""she'll never be yours"" intending to kill her so that if he couldn't have her neither could Dylan but Dylan shields Sarah just in time but himself gets shot at 2:21 PM.
The events from 30 years ago plays out with Jake/Dylan protecting Sarah/Evelyn from Noah/Jonas and at exactly 2:22 PM Jonas gets shot by the police who have followed Dylan there. Dylan also falls in Evelyn's arms and momentarily closes his eyes having visions of Jake and Evelyn being affectionate. He does not die and Sarah then looks at the clock, saying it was 2:23 PM and they managed to survive. Turns out that the Jake was framed for murdering Noah and Evelyn as the police had wanted to save the reputation of Noah since he was a Police detective and one of them. Also the dying star; Hamlin mentioned at the start of the movie finally disappears but a new star is immediately reborn.
In the ending scene, it is shown that Dylan and Sarah are living happily, with Dylan having finally overcome his fear of flying and is now a pilot and Sarah smiling affectionately at their baby in the cradle."

Spider-Man: Homecoming,"Following the Battle of New York,[N 1] Adrian Toomes and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), a partnership between Tony Stark and the U.S. government. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons. Eight years later, Peter Parker is drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute,[N 2] but resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger.
Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, after preventing criminals from robbing an ATM with their advanced weapons from Toomes, Parker returns to his Queens apartment where his best friend Ned discovers his secret identity. On another night, Parker comes across Toomes' associates Jackson Brice / Shocker and Herman Schultz selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons, and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.
Parker and Ned study a weapon left behind by Brice, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, Parker races to the Washington Monument where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Parker saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush Liz. Returning to New York City, Parker persuades Davis to reveal Toomes' whereabouts. Aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan, but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers and takes away the suit.
Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Toomes is Liz’s father. Deducing Parker's secret identity from Liz's account about him, Toomes threatens retaliation if he interferes with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters, dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair. He is first ambushed by Schultz, but defeats him with the help of Ned. At the lair, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes, and leaving him for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away, and Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time. Stark returns Parker's suit, which he puts on at his apartment just as his Aunt May walks in.
In a mid-credits scene, an incarcerated Gargan approaches Toomes in prison. Gargan has heard that Toomes knows Spider-Man's real identity, which Toomes denies."
War for the Planet of the Apes,"Two years have passed[9] since the human-hating bonobo Koba attacked the human survivors in San Francisco. Since then, Caesar and his tribe of intelligent apes have been forced against a rogue U.S. military faction known as Alpha-Omega. Led by a ruthless Colonel, Alpha-Omega employs many apes formerly loyal to Koba, derogatorily called ""donkeys"".
An Alpha-Omega platoon launches an attack on an ape outpost, but it fails and four soldiers, including one named Preacher and a ""donkey"" gorilla named Red, are captured. Caesar releases the soldiers, hoping the display of mercy will show the Colonel that the apes are not savages; Red escapes by injuring the albino gorilla Winter. Later, Caesar's eldest son Blue Eyes and lieutenant Rocket return from a long journey. Blue Eyes reports that they found a place across the desert that is ideal for the apes. Despite an uneasy Winter asserting that the apes should leave immediately, Caesar decides they need to prepare first. That night, the Colonel leads a team of soldiers in infiltrating the apes' home, where he kills Blue Eyes and Caesar's wife Cornelia. Upon discovering this, Caesar attempts to prevent the Colonel's escape but fails. Afterward, the apes are unable to find Winter, who they believe betrayed them out of fear.
In the morning, the tribe gathers to journey to safety. Leaving his youngest son, Cornelius, in the care of Blue Eyes' wife Lake, Caesar departs to exact revenge while serving as the decoy for the other apes. Accompanied by Rocket, his orangutan adviser Maurice, and his gorilla lieutenant Luca, the apes enter an abandoned village, where they kill a deserted soldier in self-defense. They then discover a mute girl, who Maurice befriends and adopts, giving her a small rag doll. They then find Winter at a beachside military camp, having become a ""donkey"". They confront Winter, who tells Caesar that the Colonel departed for the border, to meet more soldiers. Winter then attempts to call out for help, but the other apes restrain him, and Caesar accidentally suffocates him. While following the military, the apes discover soldiers who have been shot and left for dead. Their examination of a surviving soldier reveals that he is mute like the girl. Caesar then kills him in an act of mercy.
Later, the apes give chase after a hooded figure who stole one of their horses and are surprised to discover he is an intelligent ape from another zoo, named Bad Ape. While camping with Bad Ape, they discover that he knows where the border is and he hesitantly agrees to lead them there. The group reaches the border, where they see a quarantine facility. While attempting to get a closer look, Luca is killed protecting Caesar from some soldiers. An angered Caesar decides to proceed alone rather than continue to endanger his allies. While there, however, Caesar learns that Alpha-Omega captured his tribe and are forcing them to build a wall without food or water. Caesar is then captured by Red, who brings him to the Colonel. He is forced to work with the other apes, and when he inspires them to stop working, the Colonel threatens to kill Caesar to get the apes to continue.
Caesar deduces that the Colonel is barricading the facility to fend off other military forces who are against him for killing his own soldiers. The Colonel informs Caesar that the Simian Flu virus had mutated, and the human carriers subsequently became mute and devolved into a primitive state. He then has Caesar tortured with starvation to force the other apes to work. The mute girl, named Nova by Maurice, sneaks into the facility to give Caesar food, water, and her rag doll. To prevent her from being discovered, Rocket allows himself to be captured as a diversion. The next day, the Colonel comes to see if Caesar is still alive, and confiscates the doll upon discovering it. Together, Caesar and Rocket are able to work out a means of escape via an underground tunnel leading out of the facility. Though the plan is successful, Caesar remains behind to confront the Colonel as the facility comes under attack by the army of dissenting soldiers. However, he finds the Colonel infected by the virus via contact with Nova's doll. Caesar chooses not to kill the Colonel, instead watching him commit suicide.
The escaping apes are caught in the crossfire between the two armies while Red watches uncertainly. Caesar attempts to blow up a large fuel tank to take out the Alpha-Omega forces from behind, but he is shot with a crossbow by Preacher. Red then uses a grenade launcher to kill Preacher and save Caesar's life before he is shot dead by a soldier. Caesar succeeds in blowing up the tank and escapes the facility as it is consumed in a cascade of explosions, which then triggers an avalanche that wipes out the dissenting soldiers. The apes, carrying Nova, all survive by climbing nearby trees. They then cross the desert to find an oasis. While the other apes celebrate their new home, Maurice discovers Caesar's fatal wound. He promises to tell Cornelius who his father was and what he did for the apes. Caesar then dies peacefully while Maurice mourns his death and the other apes look on."
Wish Upon,"Clare Shannon, a 17-year old, is haunted by the memory of her mother's suicide. Her father Jonathan, a former musician and compulsive hoarder who dumpster dives as a hobby, finds a Chinese music box and gives it to her as a gift. Clare deciphers one of the numerous inscriptions on the box as ""Seven Wishes,"" and absent-mindedly wishes for Darcie, her tormentor and school bully, to ""rot,"" at which point Darcie develops necrotizing fasciitis and is admitted into the ICU. That same day, Clare's dog Max dies in her house's crawlspace after seemingly being eaten alive by rats. Clare realizes that the box grants wishes, but does not understand that her wishes come with consequences.
Clare makes a second wish that a popular boy named Paul falls in love with her. As a result, her wealthy uncle dies. Upon hearing the news of his death, Clare then wishes she will be in the will. The relative leaves everything to Clare. Consequently Mrs. Deluca, a friendly neighbor, suffers a fatal accident. Clare enlists the help of her classmate Ryan Hui to decypher the symbols. A relative of Ryan named Gina helps discover the meaning of the symbols grants seven wishes with consequences. Clare's fourth wish is for her father to stop being a dumpster diver and he immediately has a personality shift. Soon after, Gina deciphers the meaning of the phrase which says ""When the music ends, the blood price is paid."" After she warns Ryan, she dies. Ryan finds Gina's body and confronts Clare about making wishes on the music box, which she denies.
Clare makes a fifth wish that she is popular, but Clare is soon unhappy with the consequent attention and that she loses her relationship with her friends. As a consequence of the wish, Meredith gets stuck in an elevator and, when the cable snaps, falls to her death.
Ryan reveals that after the seventh wish is granted, the music box will claim the soul of the owner. Attempts to destroy the box are unsuccessful. Furthermore, because June has stolen the box, Clare loses her popularity and everything else she wished for. Clare recovers the box and her sixth wish is that her mother never committed suicide. Clare's mom knocks on her bedroom door along with two younger sisters. Clare later rummages through her mom’s paintings and sees a picture of the music box. She concludes that her mom was one of the previous owners of the music box and that it must have led to her original suicide.
When Clare realizes her dad pays the price for the sixth wish, Clare's seventh wish is to go back to the day her father found the box. Preventing her father from finding the box, and erasing all that has happened, Clare then asks Ryan to bury the box. Clare believes all is well but she is killed when her bully Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, in order to pay the final blood price. The music box can be heard after Clare's death, indicating that the seventh wish to reverse time would be balanced by her own death.
In a mid-credits scene, Ryan prepares to bury the music box but becomes intrigued by the inscription and starts to think."
Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"In the 28th century, the former International Space Station has been added to until its mass threatens to cause it to fall out of orbit. Relocated to deep space, it becomes Alpha, a space-traveling city inhabited by millions of creatures from thousands of planets. A special police division is created to preserve peace through the galaxy, including happy-go-lucky Major Valerian and his partner, no-nonsense Sergeant Laureline.
En route to a mission, Valerian dreams of a planet, Mül, where a low-tech humanoid race lives peacefully. They fish for pearls containing enormous amounts of energy, and use small animals to replicate them. Wreckage begins plummeting from the sky, followed by an apocalyptic explosion. Moments before her death a young princess manages to send out a telepathic signal.
Shaken, Valerian awakes. After an analysis reveals he might have received a signal from across time and space, he learns that his mission is to retrieve a ""Mül converter"", so-called for being able to replicate anything it eats. It is the last of its kind, and currently in the hands of black market dealer Igon Siruss. Before setting out, Valerian asks Laureline to marry him, but she brushes him off, due to his many affairs with female colleagues and his aversion to commitment.
Travelling to a massive extra-dimensional bazaar called Big Market, Valerian disrupts a meeting between Igon and two hooded figures who look like the humanoids from his vision. They also seek the converter, which is revealed to be one of the small animals he saw in his vision. Valerian and Laureline recover the converter, and he surreptitiously steals one of the pearls. Aboard their ship, he learns that Mül was destroyed 30 years earlier, and all information about it is classified.
They return to Alpha, where their superior, frosty Commander Arün Filitt, informs them the center of the station has been infected by an unknown force, rendering it highly toxic. Troops sent into the area have not returned, and the infection is growing. Laureline and Valerian are assigned to protect the commander during an interstation summit to discuss the crisis. Against the Commander's wishes, Laureline maintains possession of the converter.
During the summit, the humanoids suddenly attack, incapacitating everyone before kidnapping Filitt. Valerian chases the kidnappers to the infected area and crashes his vehicle. Evading arrest for insubordination, Laureline enlists the help of some aliens to track Valerian, and finds him unconscious at the edge of the infected zone. She wakes him, but is kidnapped by a primitive imperial tribe emigrated from planet Goara[17] called ""Boulan Bathors"" that lives nearby. Valerian infiltrates the tribe's territory with the help of a shape-shifting dancer, Bubble. They save Laureline and escape, but Bubble is mortally wounded. As she dies, she convinces Valerian to never give up on his feelings for Laureline.
Valerian and Laureline venture further into the infected area, realizing it is actually not toxic and contains some wrecks of antique spacecraft. They reach a large shielded hall where they find the humanoids, known as Pearls, with an unconscious Filitt. Their leader, Emperor Haban Limaï, explains that his people lived peacefully on Mül until a battle broke out in orbit between the human government's fleet and another species. The human commander, Filitt, ordered the use of a doomsday weapon that annihilated both the enemy and the planet. Upon dying, Princess Lihö-Minaa transferred her soul into Valerian's body. A small group of survivors took shelter in a crashed human spaceship. They managed to repair it, and learned of the humans' technology and history. They eventually came to Alpha, where they assimilated more knowledge and built a ship that could recreate their former home. They needed only the converter and the pearl to launch the ship. Filitt admits his role in the genocide, but argues that it was necessary to end the war, and the cover-up to prevent the humans from being expelled from Alpha. Valerian and Laureline disagree, stating that the commander has only been trying to save himself from the consequences for his actions, before Valerian knocks him out again.
Valerian hands over the pearl he stole, and Laureline persuades him to return the converter too, ignoring procedures. While the Pearls' spacecraft prepares for takeoff, the other species in Alpha, Filitt's pre-programmed robot K-Tron soldiers attack the Pearls, the government soldiers who were sent to assist Valerian, and their support staff, but are ultimately defeated. The spacecraft departs and Filitt is arrested. Valerian and Laureline are left adrift onboard a still working Apollo Command/Service Module, which is identified by radio technicians as ""Destiny 2005"", and Laureline finally accepts Valerian's marriage proposal as they wait for rescue."
Girls Trip,"Four lifelong best friends, the ""Flossy Posse"", have grown distant over the years. When lifestyle guru Ryan Pierce (Regina Hall), who is dubbed ""the next Oprah"", is offered an opportunity to be the keynote speaker at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans, she decides to bring along her friends to turn her work vacation into a girls' trip.
Joining Ryan is Sasha (Queen Latifah), an ex-journalist from Time magazine who now owns a floundering gossip site and is struggling financially; Lisa (Jada Pinkett Smith), a nurse and uptight mom who has not had a boyfriend since her divorce years earlier; and Dina (Tiffany Haddish), a happy-go-lucky, impulsive party animal who was fired after assaulting a coworker shortly before the trip.
While on the trip, Sasha is sent a tip that shows a picture of a black man's head kissing an Instagram model, presumed to be Ryan's husband Stewart. The friends are reluctant to tell Ryan, but when Dina spills the news, Ryan shocks them by telling them she is already aware of the situation and that they are in couple's counseling. Nevertheless, when Dina sees Stewart at their hotel, she threatens him with a broken bottle, resulting in her getting ejected and banned from the hotel. In solidarity all the girls leave with her, but the only hotel they are able to get is a sleazy one-star motel frequented by customers of prostitutes.
The ladies go to Essence Fest where they run into Julian, another old friend, and Malik, a young man whom spotted Lisa earlier in the crowd. After the concert Ryan flirts with Julian, who nicely rejects her, since she is still married. He gives up his suite so that the women have somewhere decent to stay. Meanwhile, Lisa takes Malik with her intending to have sex with him, but stops as she is intimidated by the size of his penis.
Ryan hosts a cooking demonstration with Stewart that goes awry when his mistress Simone shows up. Nevertheless, a potential investor is impressed and a business meeting is set up for Ryan and Stewart with their agent, Elizabeth. However, Dina serves the women absinthe right before the meeting, which causes them to hallucinate. At her meeting Ryan thinks the waitress is Stewart's mistress, Lisa thinks her kids are at the club with her, Dina thinks she is flying and Sasha thinks she is making out with an attractive man who is actually a lamp. The girls eventually pull Ryan out of the meeting, though they leave behind her agent who is also hallucinating, having drunk the absinthe with them.
The girls decide to go to a club to dance off the absinthe where they run into Simone and her friends and have a dance off before getting in a bar fight. They are rescued by Julian, who picks them up before they can get arrested and takes them back to their hotel.
Ryan and Stewart are offered a massive deal from the chain store Best Mart, whose representative wants to hire them as spokespeople. Ryan goes out to celebrate with the girls, going to one of Julian's shows. While there Simone shows up and tells Sasha that she is pregnant and that Stewart has stopped returning her calls. She offers to give Sasha's blog exclusive content to her affair with pictures as well. Stewart once again goes to Ryan to convince her to stay with him to finalize their deal. Nevertheless, Simone goes public, and when she does, Ryan lashes out at Sasha accusing her of being the one who leaked the pictures. The fight spills out into the relationship of all the women and they all part on bad terms.
Dina and Lisa make up quickly. After Sasha decides to take down her blog, disgusted with the celebrity gossip racket, Dina and Lisa reunite with her and the three of them get together to go rescue Ryan who has decided to stay with Stewart through the scandal.
Ryan begins to give her keynote speech and denies that the picture of Stewart and Simone is real. When her friends walk into the room and Ryan sees them, she turns her speech around, revealing that Stewart has cheated on her and that she can no longer lie to herself and her public. The speech is a massive success and when the women reunite after the show, Ryan apologizes to Sasha. Ryan's agent arrives and tells Ryan that the deal with Best Mart is still on but with her alone. Ryan decides to take Sasha with her as her business partner the way they planned to be years ago. A series of events shows the girls happily reunited and Ryan beginning a relationship with Julian."
First Kill,"Wall Street broker Will Beamon (Hayden Christensen) has been struggling with being present for his wife Laura (Megan Leonard) and son Danny (Ty Shelton). Shortly after hearing of Danny being bullied at school, Will decides to take his family to his hometown, Granville, Ohio in order to bond with Danny. Upon entering Granville, Will is reacquainted with Police Chief Marvin Howell (Bruce Willis), a family friend who at one point dated his aunt, Dottie (Deb G. Girdler). Howell advises Will on taking precaution after informing him of a recent bank robbery. While teaching Danny how to hunt with a rifle, Will and Danny witness a heated exchange between two men, one of them holding the other at gunpoint. The unarmed man (Gethin Anthony) is shot in the shoulder after throwing a key near Will's position at a shooting station, attracting the gunman's attention. The gunman opens fire on Will, prompting Will to shoot him with his hunting rifle in self-defense. Upon inspecting the gunman, discovers that the gunman was a police officer who failed to identify himself. Distraught, Will brings the wounded man to the family cabin in order for Laura, a hospital nurse, to provide first aid.
Shortly after being treated, the man takes Danny hostage at knife-point, demanding that Will help him retrieve the discarded key in exchange for Danny's freedom. While attempting to retrieve the key at a shooting shack, a uniformed officer, Richie Stechel (William DeMeo), opens fire on Will and the gunman. The gunman tells Will to meet him at a bulletin board after retrieving the key. After a failed attempt at pursuing his son, Will learns of the gunman's name from Howell as Levi Barrett, and that the deceased officer was Richie's brother, Charlie (Shea Buckner). Will waits until nightfall to retrieve the key, only to be confronted by Richie. Will successfully subdues Richie, and heads to the bulletin board for further instructions. Meanwhile, Danny bonds with Levi and learns the reasons behind robbing the bank. Howell and the Stechel brothers engineered the heist and intended to use Levi as the fall guy. Levi agreed to the heist in order to financially support Mabel Fantion (Christine Dye), Adele's (Magi Avila) cancer-ridden mother. Levi was supposed to drop off the stolen money at a drop-site, but did not arrive due to fear of the site being compromised with a potential assassin. Howell also deduces Levi's predicament after a uniformed officer investigates Barrett's apartment.
Howell and Will converge on Mabel's hospital bed, with Howell questioning Will. While Howell is distracted with a radio call by an officer, Will receives a map from Mabel revealing the location of the post office where the stolen money was stashed and the location of an underground bunker to make the exchange at. The key is used to unlock the mailbox containing the stolen cash. Will briefly eludes Howell, and is caught again after retrieving the money. Seemingly sympathetic to Will's situation, Howell provides Will transport to the bunker in order to apprehend Levi. Will gives the money to Levi and is reunited with Danny. During this reunion, Richie kidnaps Laura from the family cabin and drives her to Howell's location for leverage.
While attempting to flee, Adele is murdered by Howell. Left with nothing to lose, Levi attacks Howell and Richie only to be wounded. Will takes Danny to a hunter's watchtower, where the latter pushes a pursuing Richie off a ladder to knock him out. Howell holds Laura at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her. Danny retrieves Richie's pistol and attempts to shoot Howell, only for Will to stop him. In an attempt to taunt Will, Howell reveals himself as the person that murdered Will's father years earlier. Levi walks after Howell, only to be shot dead, providing Will the opportunity to shoot Howell in the head.
During the aftermath, Richie is questioned by the rest of the police department, and Mabel was found dead on the hospital bed, presumably murdered by Howell by removing her life support system. The Beamon family returns home to deal with their daily lives."
The Emoji Movie,"Gene is an emoji that lives in Textopolis, a digital city inside the phone of his user Alex. He is the son of two meh emojis named Mel and Mary, and is able to make multiple expressions despite his parents' upbringing. His parents are hesitant of him going to work, but Gene insists so that he can feel useful. Upon receiving a text from his crush Addie, Alex decides to send her an emoji. When Gene is selected, he panics, makes a panicked expression, and wrecks the text center. Gene is called in by Smiler, a smiley emoji and leader of the text center, who concludes that Gene is a ""malfunction"" and therefore must be deleted. Gene is chased by bots, but is rescued by Hi-5, a once popular emoji who has since lost his fame due to lack of use. He tells Gene that he can be fixed if they find a hacker, and Hi-5 accompanies him so that he can reclaim his fame.
Smiler sends more bots to look for Gene when she finds out that he has left Textopolis, as his actions have caused Alex to think that his phone needs to be fixed. Gene and Hi-5 come to a piracy app where they meet a hacker emoji named Jailbreak, who wants to reach Dropbox so that she can live in the cloud. The trio is attacked by Smiler's bots, but manage to escape into the game Candy Crush. Jailbreak reveals that Gene can be fixed in the cloud, and the group goes off into the Just Dance app. While there, Jailbreak is revealed to be a princess emoji who fled home after tiring of being stereotyped. They are once again attacked by bots, and their actions cause Alex to delete the Just Dance app. Gene and Jailbreak escape, but Hi-5 is taken along with the app and ends up in the trash.
Mel and Mary go searching for Gene and have a very lethargic argument. They make up in the Instagram app when Mel reveals that he, too, is a malfunction, explaining Gene's behavior. While traveling through Spotify, Jailbreak admits that she likes Gene just the way he is, and that he should not be ashamed of his malfunction. They make it to the trash and rescue Hi-5, but are soon attacked by a bot upgraded with illegal malware. They evade it by entangling it's arms and enter Dropbox, where they encounter a firewall. After many tries, the gang get past it with a password being Addie's name and make it to the cloud, where Jailbreak prepares to reprogram Gene. Gene admits his feelings for Jailbreak, but she wishes to stick to her plan of venturing into the cloud, unintentionally causing Gene to revert to his apathetic programming out of heartbreak. The upgraded bot takes Gene, and Hi-5 and Jailbreak race after them on a Twitter bird summoned by Jailbreak in her princess form.
As Smiler prepares to delete Gene, Mel and Mary arrive. Mel reveals to everyone that he is also a malfunction. Smiler, thus, also is threatened. Jailbreak and Hi-5 arrive and disable the bot, which falls on top of Smiler. Alex has since taken his phone to the store and asks to have his phone erased to fix the problem. Out of desperation, Gene prepares to have himself texted to Addie, making numerous faces to express himself. Realizing that Addie received a text from him, Alex stops his phone from getting erased, saving the emoji and finally getting to speak with Addie. She likes the emoji Alex sent. Gene accepts himself for who he is and is celebrated by all of the emojis.
In a mid-credits scene, Smiler has been relegated to the ""loser lounge"" for her crimes, wearing numerous braces due to her teeth being cracked by the bot, and playing and losing a game of Go Fish. The rest of the unused and forgotten emojis are in the favourite lounge."
Detroit,"On July 23, 1967, the Detroit Police Department stage a raid on an unlicensed club during a celebration for returning black veterans from the Vietnam War. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the 12th Street Riot. With state authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor George W. Romney authorizes the Michigan Army National Guard and President Lyndon B. Johnson authorizes Army paratroopers to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, kills the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges.
The Dramatics, a professional black R&B group, arrive in Detroit hoping to score a recording contract. Seconds before their scheduled performance at a music hall, the police shut down the venue and order them to leave the city. En route, their bus is attacked by rioters and the group subsequently splits up, with lead singer Larry Reed and his friend Fred Temple renting a room at the local Algiers Motel for the night. They meet two white girls, Julie Ann and Karen, who introduce them to their friends Carl Cooper and Aubrey Pollard. Carl and another friend stage a prank using a starter pistol, upsetting Julie and Karen, who move to the room of Greene, a Vietnam War veteran, while Larry and Fred return to their own room.
Melvin Dismukes, a private security guard, is assigned to protect a grocery store from looters and ingratiates himself with the Guardsmen. Carl decides to fire several blanks from his pistol in the direction of the troops to frighten them, but they mistake it for a sniper attack and pinpoints it coming from the Algiers due to the pistol's muzzle flash. The Michigan State Police, National Guard, and Detroit Police arrives at the motel to investigate, led by Detroit police officer Krauss. Entering the building, they gun down Carl when he tries to escape, and plant a knife next to his body as he bleeds out and dies.
They round up everyone in the hotel and line them against the wall, demanding to know who the sniper was. Despite not finding any weapon during a search of the room, Krauss terrorizes and interrogates the occupants of the hotel. Dismukes arrives to try to help. Unwilling to get involved, most of the state police and National Guard leave without informing anyone of Krauss's abuse.
Krauss orders several suspects to be moved to different rooms and subjected to mock executions in order to terrify the others into confessing. One police officer actually kills Aubrey, as he didn't understand the executions were supposed to be mock. Julie and Karen are taken to an upstairs room when they begin screaming, and Julie's clothes are torn off. Disgusted, a Guardsman returns, and manages to get them released from custody. Fearing arrest, Krauss permits the remaining suspects to leave, but only if they swear to keep silent. Greene and Larry agree, but Fred is killed when he refuses.
As the riots die down, Dismukes, while working his other job in a factory, is arrested and charged with murder after Julie identifies him as being present at the Algiers that night. Krauss and his fellow officers are questioned as well, and when everyone except Krauss confesses, they are also charged. Larry, whose singing career has stalled due to the trauma he experienced, is summoned as a witness to testify. The judge ultimately refuses to accept any of the confessions as evidence, and without a solid case, the all-white jury acquits Dismukes, Krauss, and their co-defendants of all charges. Dismukes confronts Krauss with the truth, but finds himself powerless to get any justice for the victims.
The film ends by explaining what became of the participants: Dismukes moved to the suburbs to escape death threats and resumed work as a security guard, Krauss and his men remained on the force but never returned to active duty, Julie rebuilt her life and started a family, and Larry became a choir singer and still lives in Detroit to the present day."
Brigsby Bear,"James lives in an underground home with his parents Ted and April Mitchum. Forced to stay underground by his parents, James' only connection with the outside world is an educational children's show called Brigsby Bear. James is obsessed with the show, owning every cassette, and filling most of his room with memorabilia. One night, while sneaking out to hang out on the roof, James sees several police cars approach the home and is taken away from Ted and April, who are arrested.
James is then brought to the police station and meets Detective Vogel, who has been working on James' case. Vogel informs James that Ted and April are not his real parents, and that he has been held captive ever since he was a baby. He also informs James that Brigsby Bear is not real, and was entirely made up by the Mitchums, with Vogel explaining that they tracked Ted from the studio where the show is made. Vogel then introduces James to his real parents, Greg and Louise Pope, and their teenage daughter Aubrey. As they try to introduce James to his new life, he cannot stop thinking about Brigsby Bear not being real.
One night, Aubrey takes James to a party. He then starts talking about Brigsby Bear to his new friends and comes up with the idea to make a movie based on the character to close the series. Spencer, Aubrey's friend who is also a filmmaker, agrees to make the movie with him. After Detective Vogel lends James the props from the show, he begins to make his movie. Spencer also starts uploading episodes of Brigsby Bear to YouTube, where it becomes a smash hit, generating a new audience to the show and buzz for the movie. Greg and Louise do not approve of James' activities, as they fear it hinders his chances of living a normal life.
While filming in the forest, James uses an explosive he made that detonates and causes a small fire, surprising Spencer. The group is arrested but James takes the blame for it. The police let him go, but they confiscate the Brigsby Bear costumes and props once again. Determined to continue production, James takes one of his parent's cars out one night, intending to steal back the costumes and props. He takes a detour first to his old underground home, now abandoned and cordoned off with yellow tape. On his way back, James stops by a diner. There he discovers Whitney, the actress who played Arielle and Nina Smiles in the show, just finishing her shift. She tells him how her dual performance was achieved with special effects and that she never knew the true circumstances behind the side acting job, having been told by Ted Mitchum that it was for Canadian public access. As the police arrive outside to take him back, James asks Whitney to reprise her dual role for his film and admits that he developed a longtime crush on her through the show.
Following a recommendation from Emily, the family's psychiatrist, James is placed in a mental institution. Meanwhile, Aubrey shows her parents parts of the movie, where the two realize that making the movie has been making James happy and has been helping him live a normal life. One night James breaks out of the institution to return home and grab some belongings but discovers his family, along with Spencer and Detective Vogel, building a Brigsby Bear set in their garage and tell him after seeing how happy he is making the movie, they have agreed to help out as well.
James later visits Ted, who is now in jail (along with April) for the kidnapping. James tells Ted about the movie and how it is missing the most crucial part; the Brigsby voice. Ted agrees to record the voice of Brigsby and James finishes the movie (with Detective Vogel fulfilling his early acting dreams by playing a character and Whitney reprising her dual role as the Smiles sisters). On premiere night, the show is sold out and James is worried that no one will like it and stays out of the theatre while the movie plays. When James walks back into the room, he is met with a standing ovation. Happy that the film is a success, James looks over to the stage, he sees Brigsby wave goodbye and disappear."
Menashe,"Menashe (Menashe Lustig (yi)), a recently widowed Hasidic Jewish man, tries to regain custody of his ten-year-old son Rieven (Ruben Niborski). Rieven is living with his aunt and uncle (Eizik, Yoel Weisshaus) per a ruling by the Rabbi (Meyer Schwartz) that Menashe must first remarry to provide a proper home for his son. Menashe's first marriage was unhappy, and he is reluctant to wed again. He works as a clerk in a grocery store with a difficult manager, and has a hard time earning enough money for himself. He doesn't wear the traditional black coat and top hat in public, though his son tells him he would look nice in one. Eizik, his successful brother-in-law, looks down on him. They argue in front of the Rabbi, who lets Rieven stay with Menashe for a week, until the upcoming memorial service for his wife, but reiterates the requirement for a two-parent home. Eizik wants the memorial meal in his finer home, but Menashe insists on having it in his shabby apartment. Getting a ""bachelor-proof"" recipe for kugel from a neighbor, Menashe puts the pan in the oven before going to the cemetery for the service. He and the participants, including the Rabbi, return to an apartment full of smoke. Eizik criticizes the burnt kugel, but the Rabbi praises it and insists the uncle eat a piece. Menashe begs Eizik to let Rieven live with him, but is told he must first find a wife. Menashe says he will see the matchmaker again. He goes to the ritual bath (mikvah), and dons a coat and top hat.
The plot is loosely based on Lustig's life.[3] In an interview with the Los Angeles Times he said that ""unlike Menashe in the film, I'm not a schlimazel by nature. Maybe just a schlimazel by situation.""[4]
Customs and religious practices depicted include:"
The Dark Tower,"Eleven-year-old Jake Chambers experiences visions involving a Man in Black who seeks to destroy a Tower and bring ruin to the Universe, and a Gunslinger who opposes him. Jake's mother, stepfather, and psychiatrists dismiss these as dreams resulting from the trauma of his father’s death the previous year.
At his apartment home in New York City, a group of workers from an alleged psychiatric facility offer to rehabilitate Jake; recognizing them from his visions as monsters wearing human skin, he flees. Jake tracks down an abandoned house from one of his visions, discovers a high-tech portal, and travels to a post-apocalyptic world called Mid-World.
In Mid-World, Jake encounters the last Gunslinger, Roland Deschain who emerged in his visions. Roland is pursuing Walter Padick, the Man in Black, who had also appeared in Jake’s dreams, across a desert, seeking to kill him in revenge for the murder of his father, Steven, and all remaining gunslingers. He explains that Walter, over the decades, has been abducting psychic children, and is attempting to use their ""shine"" to bring down the Dark Tower, a fabled structure located at the center of the Universe; this will allow beings from the darkness outside to invade and destroy reality.
Roland takes Jake to a village to have his visions interpreted by a seer. Learning of Jake's escape and journey to Mid-World, Walter investigates and discovers from his minion Sayre that Jake has ""pure Shine"", i.e. enough psychic potential to destroy the Tower single-handedly. While Jake's mother and stepfather failed to search for Jake, they meet Walter as they discover that he is from one of Jake's drawings. He kills Jake's stepfather, then interrogates his mother about his visions and kills her too. In Mid-World, the seer, Arra, determines that the machine is six months away on foot and portal access is restricted to Walter's bases. Jake realizes that Walter has a base in New York that they can use to reach the machine. Walter's minions, the Taheen, attack the village, but Roland individually kills each of them. Roland and Jake return to Earth where Jake gets Roland's injuries treated at a hospital and learns the location of Walter's base from a homeless man that had earlier helped him. When Jake returns home to check in on his mother and stepfather, he finds her charred remains and his stepfather lying dead and breaks down in tears. Roland vows to kill Walter ""for both of us"" and comforts Jake by teaching him the Gunslinger's Creed, which he hasn't uttered since his own father’s death, as well as the basics of gun fighting.
As Roland re-arms himself at a gun store, he is attacked by Walter, who captures Jake and takes him through a portal at his base to a machine that will use Jake to destroy the Tower. Jake uses his psychic powers to alert Roland to the portal code he needs, and Roland battles his way through Walter's henchmen and reopens the portal which Jake forces to stay open. Walter is forced to return to New York to fight Roland and wounds him. After Jake reminds him of the Gunslinger’s Creed, Roland recovers and kills Walter with a trick shot after a brief fight. Roland destroys the machine, saving the Tower, Jake, and the other children.
Afterwards, Roland says that he must return to his own world and offers Jake a place by his side as his companion. Jake accepts the offer as he has nowhere else to go, and the two depart for Mid-World."
Kidnap,"Karla Dyson (Halle Berry), a diner waitress, lives a mostly perfect life as a single mother with her six-year-old son Frankie (Sage Correa) despite fighting a custody battle/court order with her estranged husband.
One day, Karla takes Frankie to the local carnival. Upon entering, she temporarily leaves her son, in order to take an important phone call from the divorce lawyer she is working with. But when Karla comes back, she finds that her son is missing, leaving his toy voice recorder behind. Suddenly, Karla sees a woman dragging Frankie aggressively into a green Ford Mustang and, while the car is driving away, she clings at the side of the car trying to stop them, losing her phone in the process. Karla drives her car and chases the other one, with an ensuing lengthy chase.
However, with her phone lost, she tries to get help from nearby motorists, but the attempt is thwarted by the kidnappers. Karla is then forced to take another route after the woman threatens to kill her son. Not giving up on rescuing her son, Karla chases the green car again.
Karla hears the abductor's voice from her son's toy voice recorder, revealing the abductor's name Margo, who claims that Karla is looking for her son (despite all attempts to discourage her). Margo sees Karla talking over the phone. She then sees a police motorcycle several meters behind her. Hoping to stop the abductors' car, Karla sways her car. The abductors' car slams the police motorcycle into Karla's car, apparently knocking the police officer unconscious.
Upon stop at grassy field, Karla confronts another abductor and demands he release her son, as long as she gives her money to the abductors. However, Margo gets out of the car and forces Karla to ride with her, who claims that they will get $10,000 ransom in exchange of her son upon reaching their destination. Margo orders Karla to follow her accomplice's car.
Upon reaching the tunnel, Margo attacks her, but Karla manages to subdue her and throws her out of the car. Karla puts on Margo's shirt, fooling the second abductor temporarily as she exits the tunnel. Having realized that the driver is not Margo, Karla is forced not to follow the car after the second abductor threatens to drop Frankie out onto the dangerous highway. After Karla loses them for several minutes, she spots a road accident and finds the abductors' car ahead of the traffic jam. One of the motorists saw the man and the boy emerge from the car and Karla drives after them.
Karla stops at the police station to report the incident and sees posters of young children who had been missing for a decade. Fearing that her son will disappear for good, she continues the chase. Karla eventually finds the black Volvo used by the abductor and chases him until she finally runs out of fuel. Karla hitches a ride to follow the abductor but is suddenly hit by the abductors' car, killing the driver.
Upon recovering, she finds that her son isn't there in the car. The male abductor emerges from his car and begins to shoot at her with a sawed-off shotgun. He tries to attack her and she releases the brake, causing the car to reverse into the woods with the abductor clinging to it being struck to death by tree branches. Karla yells at the man demanding to know where her son is, but he dies before she can get the answer. Karla finds his identification card and learns his name, Terrence Vickey, and an address where her son might be.
Karla arrives at the Vickey house and eventually locates Frankie in the barn with two other kidnapped girls. Before that, she calls 911 as she hides from Margo, who leaves the house in search for her husband Terrence. Karla successfully rescues Frankie, but when Margo — who has just realized that Terrence is dead — returns, she and her son run out of the barn before she can retrieve the two girls. Karla creates a diversion by sailing the skiff away while hiding underwater.
Margo discovers them hiding, and Karla drags Margo down into the water and drowns her. Returning to the barn, she is approached by a man who is the Vickey's neighbor, who holds her at gunpoint. After listening to her and hearing the children in the barn attic, he then offers to help her by getting the two girls down. Realizing that he is the ringleader of the kidnappings since he knew that two girls were there without looking, she kills him with the shovel just before he draws his gun at her.
As the police arrive, Karla rescues the two girls and the media reports praise her for saving the children from the abductors, and announcing that Karla's actions have led to police breaking up an international child abduction ring, with arrests being made in other parts of Louisiana, as well as Texas, Mississippi, and Florida. The media hails Karla as a hero."
Wind River,"During a winter season in Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, expert tracker and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert discovers the frozen body of 18-year-old Natalie Hanson who was barefoot, without proper winter attire, miles from any building, and had a blood-stained groin. FBI special agent Jane Banner arrives to investigate a possible homicide. The next day, Jane learns from Natalie's father, Martin, that his daughter was dating a new boyfriend, but he does not know the man's name or whereabouts. The autopsy shows blunt trauma and sexual violence and confirms Cory's deduction that the girl died from exposure, specifically pulmonary hemorrhage caused by rapid inhalation of sub-zero air. However, the medical examiner is unable to confirm the death as a homicide, therefore preventing Jane from calling in an additional FBI investigative unit.
Cory discovers that Natalie's boyfriend is Matt Rayburn who works security at a nearby oil drilling site. The next day, Matt's body is discovered, nude and heavily ravaged by scavenging wildlife. Cory tells Jane about his daughter's death three years earlier, whose body was discovered in the snow, following a party while he and his wife were away.
Jane, accompanied by Tribal Police Chief Ben Shoyo and additional officers, visit the drill site where they meet with several of the security guards. They report that Matt stormed off a few days ago following an argument with Natalie and has not been seen since. One guard mentions that they heard about Natalie's body being found by monitoring law enforcement radio channels. Jane points out that Natalie's name was not given out. One of the police officers notices that the security guards are slowly surrounding Jane and her team. The confrontation quickly escalates into an armed standoff as they argue over who has jurisdiction. Jane defuses the situation by asserting federal authority. She asks to see where Matt was bunking, and they resume their approach to the trailer.
A flashback then depicts Natalie in bed with Matt in his trailer. Unexpectedly, his security colleagues barge into the trailer after a night of hard drinking. Pete, a particularly vulgar crew member, taunts them and tries to sexually assault Natalie, which provokes Matt to violence. The guards retaliate by beating Matt down while Pete rapes Natalie. Matt's attempt to fight back gives Natalie an opportunity to escape, but the group bludgeon him to death.
Back in the present, Cory has retraced the tracks from where Matt's corpse was found back to the drilling camp. Meanwhile, Jane and the police approach the drill crew's sleeping quarters. Cory, standing at a distance on a hill above the camp and looking down at the group, radios a warning to Ben but not before Jane, wearing a bullet-proof vest, is hit in the chest by a shotgun blast fired through the door by Pete, wounding her. A firefight ensues, in which Ben and the other officers are killed. As the surviving security guards prepare to execute Jane, Cory picks them off with his rifle, except for Pete, who, though wounded, flees on foot. Cory catches Pete and takes him up a mountain top. After forcing Pete's confession, Cory offers him the same chance Natalie had: a barefooted escape toward a distant road wearing light-weight clothing. Pete runs through the snow but quickly succumbs as his lungs give out from the same pulmonary hemorrhage that killed Natalie.
Cory visits Jane in the hospital and praises her toughness. He later visits Martin, finding him sitting outside his house wearing his ""death face"" paint. Cory tells Martin that the case is closed and that the man responsible for Natalie's death went out, ""with a whimper."" They share grief over their daughters' deaths.

Annabelle: Creation,"In 1943, dollmaker Samuel Mullins and his wife Esther grieve for the loss of their seven-year-old daughter Annabelle ""Bee"", who was killed in a car accident.
Twelve years later, in 1955, the Mullins open their home to provide shelter for Sister Charlotte and six girls left homeless by the closing of their orphanage. Despite having been told not to enter Bee's locked bedroom, Janice, a young orphan crippled by polio, is awakened by a noise, discovers a note saying ""find me"", and sneaks into the room, which has mysteriously become unlocked. She finds a key for Bee's closet and unlocks it, where she sees an eerie porcelain doll. This unwittingly releases a powerful demon, who begins to terrorize the girls, displaying a special interest in Janice.
On the second night, the demon continues to torment Janice, revealing its true form and declaring that it wants ""her soul"". Although she attempts to get away using a stairlift, she is left severely injured when caught by the demon and thrown from the second floor landing to the first floor. Janice is now confined to a wheelchair and she tells Sister Charlotte about the demon but Sister Charlotte dismissed it. The night after the incident, she sleeps in a different room from Linda, who is tormented by the demon. The next morning, Janice is dragged into a shed. The demon, taking Bee's form, successfully possesses her. One of the other orphans, Janice's best friend Linda, notices changes in her behavior and admits to Samuel that Janice had snuck into Bee's room and found the doll two nights earlier. Shortly after Linda's revelation, the possessed Janice, who can now walk, transforms into the demon and brutally kills Samuel.
Linda walks in to where Janice was sleeping and sees the creepy doll by her side. She throws it into the well, with Sister Charlotte noticing her. A strange noise comes out of the well and Linda is almost dragged into the well but Sister Charlotte saved her. Alarmed, Sister Charlotte speaks with the disfigured Esther, who is confined to her bedroom. Esther explains that after Bee's death, they prayed to whatever entity would grant their wish to see their daughter again. An unknown entity answered their prayer and though they briefly see Bee's spirit again, the entity convinces them to transfer its essence into one of Samuel's crafted porcelain dolls. They happily agree but soon realise that they have attracted a demon looking for a human host. One night, Esther sees Bee's spirit, along with the porcelain doll, transforming into the demon, who gouges out her left eye. Enlisting the help of priests to bless both the room and the house, they take the doll to Bee's room and lock it in a closet wallpapered with pages from the Bible. Esther then reveals that she and Samuel opened their house as a shelter for the orphans to repent of their dealings but now regrets it, since she realises that this has provided an opportunity for the demon to look for a human host.
The demon crucifies Esther and bisects her body and slams Sister Charlotte against the wall, prompting the other orphans to leave the house. Linda is trapped in the house and hides in Bee's room as the possessed Janice tries to stab her. Sister Charlotte recovers and locks the possessed Janice and the doll inside the closet. The next day, police arrive to search the house and its surroundings and find only the doll inside the bedroom closet, which they remove as evidence. Janice has escaped through a hole in the closet wall and relocates to an orphanage in Santa Monica. Still possessed, she becomes reclusive and calls herself Annabelle. The Higgins family soon adopt Annabelle.
Twelve years later, in 1967, a grown up Annabelle joins a Satanic cult and, along with her boyfriend, murders her adoptive parents in their bedroom, which catches the attention of their next door neighbors, The Forms, setting up the events of Annabelle.

The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature,"Surly Squirrel is now loved by Liberty Park's Urban wildlife community, and currently overseeing an all-you-can-eat buffet at Maury's Nut Shop. This worries Andie, as she prefers a more hard-working outlook on life. Despite Surly's reassurances all is well, Maury's Nut Shop is accidentally blown up by Mole after he forgets to cut down pressure from the boiler. Andie takes the opportunity to try getting the animals back to their roots by foraging for food in Liberty Park while Surly and Buddy try to find other food-packed places, but fail each time. Defeated, he and Buddy decide to return to the park.
Meanwhile, Mayor Percival J. Muldoon relishes in his wealth that comes from profit-making locations across Oakton City. However, he notices Liberty Park never makes money, so he decides to turn it into Libertyland to pocket more cash. Surly and Andie discover Muldoon's plot, and Surly convinces the animals to fight back, which they do successfully, and they manage to sabotage the construction worker's efforts to tear down the park.
That night, however, Surly's enjoyment is short-lived when Andie attempts to convince the animals to work hard for food as he believes it can result in disappointment. When the construction workers' foreman tells Muldoon about the animal attacks, he calls an extermination squad led by Gunther to get rid of the animals.
The next day, Surly gets caught in one of Gunther's traps, and the animals are pursued by Muldoon's dog, Frankie, who later falls in love with Precious. Surly and Buddy head out to rescue her while Andie and the rest find a new park.
While searching for Muldoon's car, Surly and Buddy run afowl with a colony of territorial white mice led by by Chinese-accented white mouse Mr. Feng. They manage to evade the mice, and find Muldoon's mansion, where they save Precious in the room of Muldoon's bratty daughter, Heather. Precious tells Frankie she is not interested in him, breaking his heart. Surly's recklessness causes Muldoon to shoot Buddy, who falls off a balcony to the street below, and into a coma. Meanwhile, Andie, Jimmy, Johnny, and Jamie find what seems to be a suitable park, but it turns out to be a golf course that almost gets them killed.
A doleful Surly returns with Precious and an unconscious Buddy, reuniting with the others in the ruined remains of the nut shop. While mourning for Buddy, Surly recounts the day he and Buddy met when they were kids when they saved each other; Buddy wakes up thanks to Precious giving him licks. Surly leads the animals to take back the park from Muldoon and his followers during the exclusive opening of Libertyland. Muldoon calls Gunther and his team over to capture them, and Surly is the only one left standing, so he goes to Mr. Feng and his army. While attacking Surly, the latter convinces Feng and the animals must work together regardless of whether they are from the city or a park; this causes Feng to spare him, and agree to help.
Surly and the mice free the animals, and round them up to take back Liberty Park. They manage to overwhelm the humans, destroy all the rides, and attract the attention of the police. Precious finds Frankie, and apologizes to him for what happened earlier while confessing she does care for him, causing Frankie to fall in love with her again. After the pair make up, Heather tries to get Gunther to tranquilize them. But due to the interference of Surly, Andie and Buddy, Gunther shoots Heather, knocking her out while he runs away. Muldoon tries to escape the chaos using a hot air balloon, but Surly and Buddy commandeer a roller coaster to catch up to him. Surly makes it on top of the balloon, and he and Muldoon engage in a long battle that ends with Surly causing Muldoon to fall on top of a bouncy house, and get attacked by Feng and his colony. Muldoon, Heather, and Gunther are arrested for their crimes, and Libertyland is shut down for good.
Several months later, the people help rebuild Liberty Park to its former glory. After the park is rebuilt, Feng and his colony decide to stay in the park, and focus on Tai Chi, Precious and Frankie have puppies, and Surly takes Andie on a ride with Precious to rob a nut cart."

Ingrid Goes West,"Ingrid Thorburn is a mentally unstable young woman in Pennsylvania. After discovering on Instagram that an unrequited friend of hers named Charlotte did not invite her to her wedding, Ingrid crashes the reception and pepper sprays her in the face. Ingrid undergoes a brief stay at a mental hospital.
After being released, Ingrid learns of a social media influencer named Taylor Sloane while reading a magazine article. Beguiled by her seemingly perfect life, Ingrid comments on one of her photographs and receives a slight response from Sloane. With an inheritance of over $60,000 from her deceased mother, Ingrid decides to move to Los Angeles to become friends with Taylor. Upon arrival, she rents a house in Venice from Dan Pinto, an aspiring screenwriter. She visits Taylor's regular hangouts and restaurants, and gets a makeover in her style.
After running into Taylor at one of her favorite book stores, Ingrid follows her to her house and kidnaps her dog Rothko. She returns Rothko to Taylor, officially meeting her and her husband Ezra. Ingrid accepts their offer to stay for dinner, where they become acquainted. The next day, Ingrid borrows Dan's truck to help Taylor move some items to her home in Joshua Tree. Later that night, Taylor reveals she wants to buy a small house in Joshua Tree and convert it into a boutique hotel. Soon after, Ingrid damages Dan's truck while driving under the influence.

Bereft, Ingrid retreats to her home surrounded by lit candles and records a video for her Instagram page, confessing her loneliness before overdosing on pills.
Ingrid survives the suicide attempt because Dan called emergency services. She wakes in the hospital to learn that her video has gone viral, and thousands of strangers have responded to her hashtag #iamingrid to show support. Feeling loved, Ingrid smiles."

After some time following and pleading with her to leave his father, Johanna mentions that Thomas is still a child who doesn't know anything, including the fact that he actually wants to sleep with her. Telling this to W.F., W.F. asks if he really wants to sleep with her and Thomas reluctantly says that he does.
When attending a friend's party, Thomas bumps into Johanna with another man. Having an argument after Thomas makes a crude remark about her, Thomas surprisingly kisses her which ends up with them making out passionately. An affair starts and Thomas begins to fall for Johanna. He tells her that since he was a child, he has aspired to be a writer but Thomas's dream was crushed when his father told him that his essays were only serviceable.

The Hitman's Bodyguard,"Private UK-based bodyguard Michael Bryce is hired to protect Takashi Kurosawa, a Japanese arms dealer. All apparently goes well, until Kurosawa is shot in the head through the airplane window. Two years later, Bryce, fallen into disgrace, ekes out a living protecting drug-addicted corporate executives in London. Meanwhile, Vladislav Dukhovich, the ruthless and bloodthirsty dictator of Belarus is put on trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court. The prosecution is unable to make headway against him, as they are unable to substantiate their allegations with physical evidence and Dukhovich assassinates any witnesses who could do so. The prosecution's last hope is notorious incarcerated hitman Darius Kincaid, who agrees to testify against Dukhovich in exchange for releasing his wife Sonia from prison.
Interpol Assistant Director Jean Foucher assigns Amelia Roussel, an inexperienced agent and Bryce's ex-girlfriend, to lead the transportation of Kincaid. A squad of Interpol agents composed of French GIPN and British AFOs from the National Crime Agency begin to escort Kincaid from Manchester to The Hague. However, the convoy is ambushed in Coventry and everyone except Kincaid and Roussel are killed. The two retreat to a safehouse. They realise someone in Interpol must have betrayed them and they need someone from outside they can trust, so Roussel contacts Bryce. Bryce is reluctant to help, as he believes that Roussel was responsible for the death of Kurosawa two years previously, but ultimately agrees to aid them in exchange for the restoration of his reputation. After a brief showdown with Kincaid which reveals that Bryce had multiple conflicts with him in the past, Roussel returns to Interpol to update them on the situation, while Bryce and Kincaid escape an attack by Dukhovich's men.
Foucher approaches Dukhovich, revealing himself to be the traitor, and demands his payment for selling out Kincaid; Dukhovich stabs him in the hand and informs him he will only be paid when Kincaid is dead. Dukhovich's men track Kincaid's location through his cellphone and ambush him and Bryce. While they are able to fight them off, their vehicle is destroyed. The two hitchhike to a ferry terminal and take a ferry to Amsterdam, where Sonia is being held. Kincaid escapes from Bryce to send flowers to Sonia, and Bryce tracks him down and kills several more hitmen. Kincaid reveals that he killed Kurosawa two years ago, having been at the airport only by chance after another job. Enraged at the revelation that he has spent two years blaming Roussel for ""betraying"" him when in reality the client's death was a sheer fluke, Bryce punches Kincaid and then abandons him.
As Bryce bemoans his failures, a group of hitmen attacks Kincaid. Bryce changes his mind and helps Kincaid escape, but is captured. Dukhovich's men torture him in an attempt to find Kincaid, who tracks Bryce down and rescues him. After settling their differences, the two battle their way to The Hague, arriving just in time for Kincaid to testify. He testifies that Dukhovich tried to hire Kincaid to assassinate a political rival, but in the process Kincaid witnessed the execution of a village, uploading photos of the massacre to a secret FTP site that he provides the court with access to. Dukhovich resorts to his backup plan; to bomb the court, allowing him to steal a gun and attempt to kill Kincaid. Bryce jumps in the way of the bullet and tells Kincaid to stop Dukhovich from escaping. Roussel notices Foucher acting suspiciously during the attack, and deduces he was the traitor. She subdues him with Bryce's aid. Kincaid pursues Dukhovich to the roof of the building, where he attempts to escape by helicopter. Kincaid destroys the helicopter and corners Dukhovich. Dukhovich attempts to break Kincaid by claiming he will never be able to redeem himself for his sins, but Kincaid laughs it off, declares that Dukhovich should not have shot Bryce, and kicks Dukhovich off the roof to his death. In the aftermath, Bryce is recovered and has rekindled his relationship with Roussel and Sonia is released. Kincaid is rearrested for his previous crimes, but breaks out of HMP Belmarsh so he and Sonia can celebrate their anniversary in the bar in Honduras where they first met. The movie ends with them dancing and then kissing in the midst of all the fighting and chaos taking place at the bar."
Bleecker Street / FilmNation Entertainment,"Jimmy Logan is laid off from his construction job at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. While visiting his ex-wife Bobbie Jo to pick up their daughter Sadie for a beauty pageant rehearsal, he learns that Bobbie Jo and her new husband are moving to Lynchburg, making it even harder for Jimmy to visit.
Jimmy goes to a bar, run by his brother Clyde, an Iraq War veteran who wears a prosthetic hand. Max Chilblain, a pretentious British businessman and NASCAR-team owner, arrives with his friends and insults Clyde, leading to a fight with Jimmy. Meanwhile, Clyde sets fire to Max's car with a Molotov cocktail. On his way out, Jimmy yells ""cauliflower,"" which Clyde recognizes as a codeword they used when they committed crimes as young boys. Next day, Jimmy reveals his plan to rob the Speedway, exploiting his knowledge of their pneumatic tube system for moving money.
Clyde agrees to the plan, and he and Jimmy recruit their sister Mellie, a convicted safe-cracker named Joe Bang, and Joe's dimwitted brothers Sam and Fish. They plan to break Joe out of prison and return him after the heist is complete, before anyone notices. Clyde intentionally gets himself sent to prison on a minor charge. Mellie, Sam, and Fish infest the Speedway's pneumatic tubes with cockroaches that Mellie had painted different colors, helping them determine which set of tubes to use. While gathering supplies, Jimmy meets former schoolmate Sylvia, who runs a mobile clinic in need of donations; Sylvia provides Jimmy with a tetanus shot, and the two strike up a conversation. Later, Jimmy learns that construction at the speedway is being completed ahead of schedule, forcing them to reschedule the heist for a week earlier, during the much busier Coca-Cola 600 race on Memorial Day weekend.
Joe and Clyde arrange for the prison's inmates to stage a riot, resulting in a lockdown to hide their absence. They escape by hiding under a delivery truck. Mellie meets them with a Ford Mustang GT, stolen from Bobbie Jo's husband. At the speedway, Sam and Fish destroy a generator with an explosive, forcing all vendors to accept cash only. Joe improvises an explosive from bleach, gummy bears, and a dietary salt substitute, which detonates within the pneumatic tube system, allowing the crew to begin collecting all of the vendors' cash. The staff notice smoke coming out of the tubes, and security guards investigate, but a diversion set up by Jimmy and one of Clyde's bar patrons prevents them from discovering the heist. The airflow in the tube delivering the money is reversed, causing Clyde's prosthetic arm to be lost. Making their way back to the prison, Clyde and Joe are recognized by Chilblain and his sponsored NASCAR driver Dayton White. The job is a success, and Jimmy makes it to his daughter's pageant in time to hear her perform his favorite song, ""Take Me Home, Country Roads."" Jimmy then abandons the money and anonymously alerts the police so they can retrieve it.
FBI agent Sarah Grayson investigates the heist. Due to the unwillingness of the prison authorities to disclose the extent of the riot, the refuting of Chilblain's eyewitness account by White (disgruntled because he crashed during the race because he drank some of Chilblain's energy drink as part of the sponsorship deal), and the speedway administration's satisfaction with their insurance settlement, the case is closed after six months. Joe is released from prison and returns to his old home to find a bag of money buried by a tree in his yard. It is then revealed that during the heist, Jimmy purposely separated several bags of money from the rest, and sent them to the local dump with the regular trash. The rest he returned, to discourage any potential investigations. Jimmy also retrieved Clyde's prosthetic hand from the vacuum tube. Now working in a hardware store and having bought a house near his daughter and ex-wife's home, Jimmy happily reunites with his family at Clyde's bar, where they and the rest of the gang share drinks. Sylvia also arrives and shares a kiss with Jimmy. Clyde does not recognize one of the patrons, who turns out to be Grayson."

Tulip Fever,"Set in the Netherlands in the 17th century, during the period of the tulip mania, the film tells the story of an artist Jan (Dane DeHaan) who falls for a married young woman Sophia (Alicia Vikander) while he's commissioned to paint her portrait by her husband Cornelis (Christoph Waltz). The two invest in the risky tulip market in hopes of building a future together.
The story begins with 17 year old Sophia, an orphan, being betrothed to the elderly Cornelis. In return for the marriage, her sisters are able to travel to New Amsterdam (New York) in the new world, where they have an aunt awaiting them. Sophia is unhappy in the marriage, since Cornelis is not romantic and only concerned with bringing an heir to inherit his name. Cornelis has his friends show him their children, and there is talk of giving the new orphan bride Sophia six months to conceive and provide him with an heir. He already suffers from a mistake he made in the past, with his previous wife: she miscarried their first child and when Cornelis asked the doctor to save the second child over the wife, he feels that God punished him by taking his wife and his child away. Meanwhile, Sophia goes to a doctor to get checked, but the doctor turns out to be the unethical Dr. Sogh, who wants to impregnate Sophia himself. Sophia slaps him and runs away, back to her husband.
Cornelis decides to hire a painter, so that he may show off his beautiful young wife to people. Sophia agrees, but as soon as the young painter Jan arrives to paint the couple, he and Sophia fall in love. Jan sends a note to Sophia, asking her to send him a vase with tulips. She shows up at his door with the tulips, and they consummate their love.
Meanwhile, Sophia's friend, the housemaid Maria, is having an affair with the neighborhood fishmonger, Willem. Willem is also speculating in the tulip market, and is doing quite well - expecting to be independently prosperous and able to marry Maria, he even sells his business to another fishmonger. One day, Sophia borrows Maria's cloak and heads to a rendezvous with her adulterous lover. Willem, seeing Sophia in the cloak, mistakes her for Maria, and follows her to her rendezvous. Crushed by what he thinks is Maria's unfaithfulness, he goes to a pub to drown his sorrows. There a prostitute robs him of the large sum he has built up on the tulip market. When he tries to retrieve the money, he is beaten up and forcibly inducted into the navy for causing a ruckus.
Jan plots to escape to the new world - with Sophia, if possible - after having success of his own in the tulip speculation market. He hears that the nuns at St. Ursula (the convent Sophia came from) raise tulips in their gardens. Jan attempts to steal some of the bulbs, but is knocked out by the abbess of St. Ursula. When he regains consciousness, he apologises and the abbess gives him the bulbs Willem had bought before he was thrown into the navy.
Maria realises she is pregnant by Willem, which is diastrous for her; with Willem gone, the baby will be born out of wedlock. Sophia conspires with Maria: she will pretend to be pregnant instead, and when the baby is born, Sophia will pretend to die in childbirth, so she can leave to be with Jan, and Maria will stay with the baby to raise it herself.
When Maria finally gives birth to a daughter and Sophia pretends to die, Cornelis is griefstricken at the loss of his wife. Sophia, under her shroud pretending death, weeps as she now understands that Cornelis cared for her. While she is being carried away in a coffin, she regrets what she has done. When she later returns to the home, she catches sight of Cornelis lovingly cradling the baby, and senses that perhaps it's too late to set things right. She flees back to the convent where she was raised.
Jan has one last transaction that will get him enough money to let him and Sophia leave the city and also pay off all his creditors. He tasks his fool of a friend Gerrit with accomplishing this transaction, charging him not to get drunk along the way. Gerrit completes the transaction and then does get drunk. In the ensuing revelry he eats the cargo he was carrying. When he tells Jan and Jan's creditors how he ate the ""onion,"" they all know they have been ruined. The tulip bubble has burst. Jan goes to find Sophia, but finds her bright blue silk cloak in the river instead, which she cast off while fleeing back to the convent. He thinks she has flung herself into the canal as a result of the crashed tulip market.

Unlocked,"After an operation in Paris failed on her watch, CIA interrogation officer Alice Racine now works in an undercover capacity at a community centre in London. The area is a hotspot for Islamic extremism, and information she discovers in her capacity at the centre is passed on to the security services, including MI5 Intelligence Chief Emily Knowles. Her former station chief and mentor Eric Lasch meets with her, and tells her that she shouldn’t feel guilty for the failed operation (which resulted in Algerian suicide bombers killing 24 people) and that she needs to get back into the field. Meanwhile, the Central Intelligence Agency and MI5 receive intel that radical preacher Imam Yazid Khaleel is planning a biological attack on an American target on British soil in collaboration with terrorist and American born Islamic convert David Mercer. Racine is approached by Frank Sutter, an officer from the CIA’s London Station, who tells her she has orders from Europe Division Chief Bob Hunter to help them interrogate and break Khaleel’s courier they have captured.
In a hotel, Racine begins to interrogate the courier, a British-Moroccan man named Lateef, and is able to coax the message he is due to deliver to Mercer’s representative to confirm the attack. However, before divulging the details of the message to Sutter, she receives a call from her handler Ed Romley, who confusingly gives her the same mission brief as Sutter. Realising she has been tricked and the men she is working with are not CIA, she attempts to remove Lateef from their custody, but in an ensuing gunfight he is killed. She retreats to Lasch's apartment, but that is soon also attacked by the operatives, with Racine witnessing Lasch be fatally shot as she escapes to a safe house he informed her of previously. Upon arriving at the safe house, she apprehends burglar Jack Alcott, who is in the process of robbing the apartment. Restraining him in the bedroom, she contacts Hunter and Romley, who despite claiming to believe her, per protocol, send SCO19 officers to apprehend and bring her in. After fighting two of the officers and being tasered, she is saved by Alcott and the two manage to escape. Revealing he is a former Royal Marine who served in the Iraq War, Racine reluctantly decides to allow him to accompany her. Racine also seeks the help of Amjad, a friend and client from the community centre who drives a taxi.
She and Alcott confront Khaleel in a Moroccan restaurant, where he confesses he no longer believes in the radical extremism he promotes (with the courier message being a stand down order), but anticipates that Mercer will still go ahead with the attack. Following an associate of Lateef, Racine discovers Alcott is working with Sutter and the two fight, with Racine managing to escape after Alcott is killed by an aggrieved third party. Racine approaches Knowles, who agrees to help her and sets up an operation where Amjad stands in as the courier to meet with Mercer's representative. She reveals to Racine that intelligence from the French DGSI suggests senior parties in the CIA allowed the Paris attack to take place, as one of the victims killed in the bombings was a CIA whistle blower. Meanwhile, Romley's team track the bullets used in the killing of their men who apprehended Lateef to a AT308C sniper rifle, which is revealed to have been checked out of a Metropolitan Police armoury by corrupt MI5 operative John Wilson. Wilson is shown to be part of the team providing cover for Knowles operation, and guns down his fellow operatives as well as injuring Knowles whilst trying to kill Racine. Amjad is also killed in the crossfire.
Having survived the attack, Racine heads to a meeting point organised by Sutter, where it is revealed that Lasch is not only alive but is the main conspirator. After a brief struggle, he escapes, but is tracked by her to a warehouse outside of Wembley Stadium, where a sold out game of American football is due to be played between Portland and Oklahoma. Lasch reveals he wants the biological attack to take place, and the visiting Americans to transport the virus back home, in order to force the US Government to take the threat of biological warfare seriously. After shooting Wilson, Racine and Lasch engage in a brief fight, which ultimately results in him falling to his death and Racine disarming the virus canisters. Knowing that in light of the attack failing Mercer will attempt to flee to Syria, she is instructed by Hunter to intercept him en route. In Prague, Mercer is about to meet with a contact who will take him on the next leg of his journey, but is accosted by Racine at a tram station where she slices his femoral artery, killing him."
It,"In October 1988, Bill Denbrough gives his seven-year-old brother, Georgie, a paper sailboat. Georgie sails the boat along the rainy streets of small town Derry, and is disappointed when it falls down a storm drain. As he attempts to retrieve it, Georgie sees a clown in the sewer, who introduces himself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. The clown entices Georgie to come closer, then severs his arm and drags him into the sewer.
The following summer, Bill and his friends—Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stan Uris—run afoul of older bully Henry Bowers and his gang. Bill, still haunted by Georgie's disappearance and the resulting neglect from his grief-stricken parents, discovers that his brother's body may have washed up in a marshy wasteland called the Barrens. He recruits his friends to investigate, believing his brother may still be alive. Ben Hanscom learns that the town has been plagued by unexplained tragedies and child disappearances for centuries. He is targeted by Bowers' gang, after which he flees into the Barrens and meets Bill's group. They find the sneaker of a missing girl, while a member of the pursuing Bowers Gang, Patrick Hockstetter, is killed by Pennywise while searching the sewers for Ben.
Beverly Marsh, a girl ostracized over rumors of promiscuity, also joins the group; both Bill and Ben develop feelings for her. Later, the group befriends Mike Hanlon after defending him from Bowers. All the while each member of the group has encountered terrifying phenomena in various forms; these include the same menacing clown who attacked Georgie, a headless boy, a fountain of blood, a diseased and rotting man, a creepy painting come to life, Mike's parents burning alive, and a phantom Georgie.
Now calling themselves ""The Losers Club"", they realize they are all being terrorized by the same entity. They determine that ""It"" assumes the appearance of what they fear, awakens every 27 years to feed on the children of Derry before returning to hibernation, and moves about by using sewer lines, which all lead to a well currently under the abandoned house at 29 Neibolt Street. After an attack by Pennywise, the group ventures to the house to confront him, only to be separated and terrorized. Eddie breaks his arm, while Pennywise gloats to Bill about Georgie. As they regroup, Beverly impales Pennywise through the head, forcing the clown to retreat. After the encounter, the group begins to splinter, with only Bill and Beverly resolute in fighting It.
Weeks later, after Beverly confronts and incapacitates her sexually abusive father, she is abducted by Pennywise. The Losers Club reassembles and travels back to the Neibolt house to rescue her. Henry Bowers, who has killed his father after being compelled into madness by It, attacks the group. Mike fights back and pushes Bowers down the well to his apparent death. The Losers descend into the sewers and find It's underground lair, which contains a mountain of decayed circus props and children's belongings, around which the bodies of missing children float in mid-air. Beverly, now catatonic after being exposed to It's true form, is restored to consciousness as Ben kisses her. Bill encounters Georgie, but recognizes that he is Pennywise in disguise. Pennywise attacks the group and takes Bill hostage, offering to spare the others if they let It keep Bill. The Losers reject this and reaffirm their friendship, overcoming their various fears. After a brief battle, they defeat Pennywise and it retreats, with Bill declaring that It will starve during its hibernation. Bill finally accepts his brother's death and is comforted by his friends.
As summer ends, Beverly informs the group of a vision she had while catatonic, where she saw them fighting the creature as adults. The Losers create a blood oath by cutting each other's hands and forming a circle, swearing to return to Derry in adulthood if It returns and destroy the creature once and for all. Stanley, Eddie, Richie, Mike, and Ben make their goodbyes as the group part ways. Beverly tells Bill she is leaving the next day to live with her aunt in Portland. As she leaves, Bill runs up to her and they kiss."

The Good Catholic,"Three Catholic priests live in a rectory together. Young Father Daniel runs daily and lost his father in the past year. Father Ollie really likes food and is a big fan of Indiana University basketball. More elderly Father Victor is completely devoted to the church with little outside interests. He finds comfort in setting up the candles and the church for mass by himself in his own specific way. They eat together, set the weekly schedule for baptisms and church services and run the general work of the church. They also discuss scripture, their proposed homilies, and the meaning of God in their lives.
One Friday night young Father Dan meets Jane through the confessional box. She tells him she is a musician and is dying. She is new to the church thing but over the weeks they become friends to the point of playing ""battleship"" in the confessional. Jane explains how she wants to die but changes her mind at times. Dan gives her a gift of a Bible after a night of Bingo and she is offended. She invites Dan to hear her sing at her coffee house and he goes. One night they reverse roles and she wants him to unburden himself. He tells her that he is happy to be a man of God and help people but he does not see God. They become friends.
Throughout the movie each priest gives a sermon. Dan teaches that death gives meaning to life. Enjoy life now for we all die. Father Ollie teaches on compassion. We all need compassion that means to suffer with another. We need to comfort the sick and be there with the dying. Father Victor preaches that no one sees God but he lives inside each of us. God is love. You find God in the love of man. God, love, and man are one.
One night Father Dan invites Jane over for dinner at the rectory. Father Ollie is enjoying the food cooked by Dan. Serious Father Victor wants to know what Father Daniel's primary passion is. A Priest has a duty to Christ and cannot be fooled by young love. Jane, offended, leaves. Victor asks Daniel if he has lost his faith; Father Daniel says no, that he never had faith until he met Jane. He has helped her not be alone. By loving her and helping her as a friend he is loving God. He now sees God."
Gun Shy,"Aging rock star Turk Enry's supermodel wife is kidnapped while they are vacationing in Chile and he undertakes to rescue her equipped with skills better suited to playing bass, playing the field and partying."
American Assassin,"Mitch Rapp and his girlfriend Katrina Harper are on vacation in Ibiza, Spain. Moments after proposing, a jihadist cell lands on the beach and begins to attack the civilians with assault rifles. Amid the carnage, Rapp frantically attempts to find Katrina, but his fiancée is killed by the terrorists.
Eighteen months later, Rapp, now consumed by his desire for vengeance, frequents an internet message board where the terrorist responsible for his girlfriend's murder quizzes Rapp on aspects of Islam and jihad. Having secured an invitation to meet him face to face, Rapp prepares to take his vengeance on the man responsible for his girlfriend's death, but before he can kill the terrorist, the cell is suddenly ambushed by U.S. Special Forces. Upset over the perception that he has been denied his vengeance, Rapp repeatedly stabs the terrorist he was after, who is already dead from the ambush, before being dragged out by the U.S. forces. In a CIA safe house Rapp undergoes 30 days of debriefing before being offered a chance by CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy to join a black operations unit codenamed Orion. Its head, Stan Hurley, is a former U.S. Navy SEAL and a Cold War veteran who trains Rapp and the other potential recruits in asymmetric warfare.
Elsewhere, word comes down through intelligence channels that weapons grade nuclear material has gone missing from a decommissioned Russian nuclear facility. The material in question appears to be heading to Iranian hardliners, who are upset with the Iranian government's nuclear deal with the U.S. While verifying the sale of the nuclear material in Poland the plutonium is intercepted by a third party, who eliminates the sellers before vanishing into the crowd. In Virginia, Hurley sees news reports about the incident in Poland and tentatively identifies the perpetrator as a former Navy SEAL and Orion operative believed to have been killed in action and now going by the codename ""Ghost"". Hurley's team is sent into Turkey to intercept the buyer ""Ghost"" is working for.
In Istanbul, Hurley's team is identified, and the attempted intercept of the trigger device fails. Rapp pursues the buyer to his apartment, and after killing the man, retrieves his laptop. The information leads the team to Rome, where Orion operatives identify a nuclear physicist needed to craft the nuclear material into a functional nuclear weapon. While in Rome, Rapp uncovers a co-worker, Annika, as a foreign agent for Iran. She explains that she is working for the mainstream Iranian faction which is attempting to stop the hardliners from acquiring nuclear material. During a meeting between Hurley and an Iranian contact, Ghost ambushes them and kills the contact and captures Hurley.
At the CIA safe house in Rome, Annika is being moved under guard by two Mossad agents when Rapp intercepts the car and frees her. Working together, both locate the subterranean headquarters ""Ghost"" is using to build the nuclear device. After infiltrating the tunnels, Rapp locates and frees a badly injured Hurley, however Annika is captured by ""Ghost"" and she kills herself with ""Ghost's"" gun before ""Ghost"" escapes onto a boat with the nuke. Based on an earlier conversation, Hurley deduces that ""Ghost"" intends to make a kamikaze attack against the U.S. Navy's Sixth Fleet. Rapp chases after ""Ghost's"" boat, while the Sixth Fleet, alerted to the impending nuclear attack through CIA channels, prepares for the attack.
Aboard ""Ghost's"" boat, Rapp kills ""Ghost"" and attempts to divert the boat away from the Sixth Fleet to shield the ships from the blast, before throwing the nuclear weapon into the sea and escaping aboard a U.S. Navy helicopter. Seconds later the device detonates, creating a massive sink hole and subsequent tsunami that inundates the Sixth Fleet vessels, but the fleet survives the blast.
In the aftermath of the blast, Hurley is recovering from his injuries and notes that Rapp is on vacation in Dubai, while watching news reports indicating that the Iranian faction which tried to obtain the nuclear weapon will win the presidential election. In Dubai, the faction candidate and his escorts enter an elevator in which Rapp is already present, smiling."
Mother!,"In a large house recently burned by fire, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study. The ruined house morphs into a lovely home in an edenic landscape. In bed, Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens from a fiery nightmare and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she starts seeing things that unsettle her, including visualizing a beating heart within its walls.
One day, Man turns up at the house, asking for a room. Him readily agrees, and Mother reluctantly follows suit. During his stay, Man suffers coughing fits and Mother observes an open wound in his side. Soon Man's wife, Woman, also arrives to stay. Mother is increasingly frustrated with her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, telling Mother they are fans of his work and Man is dying. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, which Him had forbidden them to touch, Mother kicks them out and Him boards up his study.
Before Man and Woman can leave, their two sons arrive and fight over their father's will. The Oldest Son, who will be left with nothing, severely wounds his Younger Brother and flees. Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son for help. Alone in the house, Mother follows a trail of blood to find a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls.
Upon returning, Him informs Mother the son has died. Dozens of people arrive at the house to honor the dead son. They behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother; she snaps when they break a sink, flooding the house. She orders everyone out and berates Him for allowing so many people inside while ignoring her needs. Their argument ends in passionate lovemaking.
The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant. The news elates Him and inspires him to finish his work. Mother prepares for the arrival of their child and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it immediately sells out every copy. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans arrives at the house before they can eat. She asks Him to send them away, but he insists he has to be polite and will return soon. Mother tries to lock the doors, but more fans arrive and enter the house to use the toilet. They start stealing things as souvenirs and damaging the house, but Him is oblivious due to the adulation he is receiving. Hundreds of people fill the house and an increasingly disoriented Mother watches it devolve into chaos. Military forces battle a cult of frenzied fans who tear rooms apart and engage in religious rituals. Amidst gunfire and explosions, the Herald, the poet's publicist, organizes mass executions.
Mother goes into labor and finds Him. He takes her to his study, which he reopens so she can give birth there. The havoc outside subsides. Him tells Mother his fans want to see their newborn son; she refuses and holds her boy tightly. When she falls asleep, however, Him takes their child outside to the crowd, which passes the baby around wildly until he is killed. Devastated, Mother wades into the crowd where she sees people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she calls them murderers and stabs them with a shard of glass. They turn on her, viciously beating and stripping her until Him intervenes. He implores Mother to forgive them, but she escapes, makes her way to the basement oil tank, and punctures it with a pipe wrench. Despite her husband's pleas, she sets the oil alight; it explodes, destroying the crowd, the house, and the surrounding environment.
Mother and Him survive, but she is horrifically burned while Him is completely unscathed. He asks for her love and she agrees. He tears open her chest and removes her heart. As he crushes the heart with his hands, a new crystal object is revealed. He places it on its pedestal and, once again, the house is transformed from a burnt-out shell into a beautiful home. In bed, a new Mother appears and wakes up, wondering aloud where Him is."
Brad's Status,"Brad Sloan (Ben Stiller) owns a non-profit organization, and lives a comfortable life with his loving wife and son, but cannot help imagining how his friends Craig Fisher (Michael Sheen), Billy Wearslter (Jemaine Clement), Jason Hatfield (Luke Wilson), and Nick Pascale (Mike White) are rich and accomplished. Craig works in the White House, published a best-selling book, and constant voice in political issues; Jason owns a hedge fund firm; Billy sold a company he founded, moved to Maui, and retired; and Nick is a Hollywood director. His wife Melanie (Jenna Fischer) tries to comfort Brad, telling him that they don't need to compare themselves to the wealthiest 1%.
In the morning, Brad and his son, Troy (Austin Abrams), leave for Boston to visit colleges. After Troy confesses to him that he aims to get into Harvard, Brad sees this as a way to make up for his lost ambitions. After arriving at Harvard to meet with admissions, they find out they have missed the appointment by one day. Brad argues to see the admission committee, but Troy gets him to back down. Melanie suggests that Brad should call his old friend Craig, which he reluctantly agrees. At a restaurant, Brad calls Billy to get Craig's number and finds out that his friend Nick got married a few years back, but he was not invited. He then laments how his friends' exclusion of him confirms his fears: that he is not only a failure in his own eyes but to others as well. Brad also reflects about his waning sex life with Melanie and how his wife easily gets satisfied, which he thinks might have undermined his ambitions. After talking to Crag, Craig gets Troy a meeting with the famous Harvard music professor and the dean of admissions.
Brad and his son meet Ananya (Shazi Raja), a high school musician friend of his son, and her friend Maya (Luisa Lee). Brad relishes Annaya's idealism and her respect for his work, reminding him of his better days. She also reveals to Brad that she did not like Craig's lectures since she finds him sexist and arrogant. After having dinner with them, Brad and Troy turn down the offer of drinks with them and return to their hotel.
That night, Brad can't sleep so he decides to have a drink with Ananya. He tells her that the non-profit life was a mistake and he should have tried to make money. Ananya lets him know that he is living the white man's privilege and that there are kids she knows in India who are lucky to have dinner, so he should be grateful for what he has in his life.
Troy meets his role model music composer thanks to Craig pulling some strings. However, when Troy tells Brad that his idol is not as cool as he thought, they get in an argument where Brad tells Troy that he cannot judge people for selling out because he is just living in a bubble. The argument soon ends and Troy attends his interviews and gets a great response. During the interview, Jason calls Brad and informs him that his daughter has tethered spine. Brad then accompanies Troy to his old college, where he calls Melanie and expresses his pride about his son.
The next night, Brad has dinner with Craig, to properly thank him for his help. He finds out that his old friends, the ones he believes are leading privileged lives, are actually living with major problems. Jason Hatfield's company is under legal investigation and his daughter has a serious medical issue while Billy Weather is an addict and alcoholic. Craig also expresses some homophobic remarks about Nick. While Brad tolerates Craig's constant bragging and backhanded compliments, eventually Brad feels conflicted about how Craig treats him, questioning if they really are friends. He leaves their dinner to join Troy at the orchestral performance where Ananya and Maya are playing. Brad is feeling emotional, imagining how he lost in life. That night, Troy explains that everyone in the world is thinking of themselves, and he is the only one thinking about Brad, and he loves him.
In his thoughts, Brad is trying to imagine the future. The movie ends with him repeating ""I am still alive,"" as he turns over and goes to sleep.
At the end of the credits, Troy's imagination that his son is playing music on the street collecting coins is shown again."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"A year after the events of the previous film, Eggsy Unwin has officially joined Kingsman, taken his late mentor Harry Hart's title of Galahad and begun a relationship with Tilde, Crown Princess of Sweden. On his way home from the tailor shop, he is ambushed by Charlie Hesketh, a former Kingsman trainee who lost his arm and vocal cords during the Valentine incident, replacing them with cybernetics. Eggsy evades Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie's severed cybernetic arm hacks into the Kingsman servers through the computer system of Eggsy's car. Charlie passes on the information gained to Poppy Adams, the leader of the world's largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle. Poppy uses the information to launch a volley of missiles that destroy the Kingsman headquarters and wipe out all of the agents in Britain, aside from Eggsy and Merlin, Kingsman's tech support.
Eggsy and Merlin follow an emergency protocol which leads them to Statesman, an American private intelligence service posing as a Bourbon whiskey distillery in Kentucky. There, they discover that Harry survived his shooting thanks to Statesman technology, but is suffering from amnesia. They also learn about the Golden Circle from Statesman head Champagne and the two agencies agree to work together to bring it down. Statesman agent Tequila later develops a blue rash and shows signs of mania and is replaced by another agent, Whiskey, as Eggsy's partner. Eggsy plants a tracking device on Charlie's ex-girlfriend Clara Von Gluckfberg during a sexual encounter at Glastonbury Festival, but his revelation of the mission to Princess Tilde strains their relationship.
Eggsy later manages to cure Harry's amnesia by threatening to shoot a Cairn Terrier puppy that resembles Harry's late dog, shortly before Poppy broadcasts a message telling the world about a toxin she has added to all her drugs, which causes users to develop symptoms like Tequila's before progressing to paralysis and ultimately death. She offers the antidote to the world if the President of the United States ends his country's war on drugs and grants her cartel immunity from prosecution. The President decides to have everyone affected quarantined, intending to let them all die in order to put Poppy out of business.
Eggsy, Harry and Whiskey track Clara to the Golden Circle's antidote factory in Italy. Eggsy manages to steal an antidote sample, but it is broken by Whiskey during an ambush by the Golden Circle's henchmen, leading Harry to suspect him of working against them. Harry shoots Whiskey in the head, but Eggsy, believing Harry to be delusional as a result of his recovery, saves him with the same technology that Statesman used to save Harry. Princess Tilde calls Eggsy in a state of mania, revealing that she has been affected by the blue rash, having taken drugs due to her stress over Eggsy's infidelity. Eggsy, Harry and Merlin discover the location of Poppy's hideout, ""Poppy Land"", in Cambodia and fly there to steal the laptop which can deploy the drones carrying the antidote all over the world.
Upon their arrival at Poppy Land, Eggsy steps on a land mine, but Merlin sacrifices himself to save him and Harry. Eggsy and Harry storm through the lair; Eggsy kills Charlie, while Harry destroys Poppy's robotic attack dogs with the help of Elton John, who had been kidnapped by Poppy during the events of the previous film. They secure the laptop and inject Poppy with a concentrated dose of her toxin and heroin. Poppy gives them the laptop password in exchange for the antidote, but dies of an overdose from the heroin. Whiskey interrupts them before they can deploy the drones, revealing that he wants all drug users to die after his pregnant wife was killed in a robbery committed by two methamphetamine users. Eggsy and Harry fight and kill Whiskey, then deploy the drones to release the antidote and save the affected victims throughout the world.
In the aftermath, the President is impeached for conspiring to commit genocide on the drug victims and Statesman purchases a distillery in Scotland to help rebuild Kingsman. Statesman tech support specialist Ginger Ale is appointed to the position of Whiskey, Eggsy marries Princess Tilde and Tequila joins Kingsman, which acquires a new tailor shop in London."
The Lego Ninjago Movie,"A young boy ventures into an old relic shop, where he meets the mysterious owner, Mr. Liu, who begins to tell the boy the legend of Ninjago, a city within the Lego Universe that is frequently terrored by the evil Lord Garmadon, who is the father of Lloyd Garmadon and ex-husband of Misako (a.k.a. Koko). Ninjago despises Lloyd for being Lord Garmadon's son, which puts Lloyd under emotional stress. They do not know that Lloyd is part of the secret ninja force, consisting of Nya, Zane, Jay, Cole, Kai and their master named Wu, who always stop Garmadon from taking over the city by fighting with mechs. On Lloyd's birthday, Garmadon attacks the city once again only to be defeated. He escapes and fires nine generals of his Shark Army for failing to help him. He then begins to plan a big attack to conquer Ninjago, and his GIT's show him plans to build a gigantic mech that is immune to weapons.
Meanwhile, Lloyd and his friends see the return of Master Wu, back from a long trip he took. Master Wu tells them they aren't real ninjas if they use only mechs to fight, and discusses with Lloyd that his element is green, confusing Lloyd. Master Wu tells Lloyd he must not be angry at Garmadon; he must use his mind to fight. Wu mentions an Ultimate Weapon, giving Lloyd the hope of defeating Garmadon once and for all, despite being forbidden to use the weapon.
The next day Garmadon attacks the city with his giant mech and defeats Lloyd. As Garmadon declares his rule over Ninjago, Lloyd returns with the Ultimate Weapon. He fires it, revealing it to be a laser that attracts a real-life cat named Meowthra. Meowthra starts destroying the city while trying to get the laser. Garmadon points the laser to make the cat destroy the other mechs, before Lloyd breaks it. As Garmadon celebrates his victory, Lloyd reveals that he is the Green Ninja, and tells Garmadon that he wishes he weren't his father, leaving Garmadon confused.
Lloyd meets up with his friends and Master Wu, who are all upset with him for using the weapon. Wu tells them they must use an Ultimate, Ultimate Weapon to stop Meowthra from destroying the city, which they would reach by crossing the Forest of Dangers, the Canyon of Death, and the Temple of Fragile Foundations. Garmadon overhears Wu talking about the weapon and follows close behind. He meets up with Wu and fights him, only to end up in a cage, defeated. However, Wu loses his balance and falls off a bridge into a river, telling Lloyd he must use inner peace before getting swept away.
The ninjas decide to continue on, with Garmadon leading them much to Lloyd's disappointment. They are caught by the Shark Army, who want revenge for being fired by Garmadon and shot out of his volcano lair. The ninjas try to fight, but are easily defeated. They retreat leaving Lloyd and Garmadon behind to be caught by the Shark Army. The Shark Army begin to drop Lloyd and Garmadon into a replica volcano, but the rest of the ninjas save the day using stealth fighting. They all work together with Garmadon to escape the angry Shark Army by building a makeshift helicopter, and Lloyd and Garmadon bond together in the process.
They eventually crash down onto the Temple of Fragile Foundations. Garmadon reveals that it is his home, as well as Koko formerly being a ninja warrior herself. He tells Lloyd that he wishes he had stayed with him and his mom after deciding to conquer Ninjago, but he couldn't change so he had to stay behind. The ninjas find the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon, consisting of a set of trinkets, only to have it stolen by Garmadon who still wants to take over the city. He offers for Lloyd to be his general, but Lloyd rejects his offer. Out of fury, Garmadon locks all of them in the temple as it begins to collapse. Lloyd realizes that inner peace means for them to unleash their power within, and they successfully do this, using their elemental powers and escaping from the collapsing temple. As they fall of a cliff, Wu saves them with his ship, the Destiny's Bounty and they head towards Ninjago.
Garmadon arrives and tries to control Meowthra with the weapons but Meowthra eats Garmadon instead. Lloyd and the crew arrive and begin fighting Garmadon's army. As Lloyd approaches Meowthra, he reveals to everyone that he is the green ninja, and realizes that green means life, which brings everything together. He comforts Meowthra and tells Garmadon he forgives him and that he's sorry. Garmadon cries tears of fire, which causes Meowthra to spit him out. After reconciling, Garmadon moves in with Lloyd and Koko, Meowthra becomes the mascot of Ninjago, and Lloyd is hailed as a hero.
As the story concludes, Mr. Liu tells the boy that he will start to train him as a ninja.
A mid-credits scene also shows a gag reel of a cup stunt performed by Chan as Liu at the film's opening."

Patty, disheartened, tells him that she only wishes for the world to see how amazing her son is. She soon begins enabling Jeff's worst tendencies including his laziness and affinity for drinking. He begins missing physical therapy appointments due to long nights of drinking usually with Patty equally as drunk. Erin, who has since moved in, finds Patty blacked out on the couch and Jeff in a bathtub unconscious and covered in vomit. The next day she snaps at Patty for her selfishness and negligence before calling Jeff out for his self-pity and refusal to stand up to his mother. She storms off leaving Jeff and Patty to drive home alone.
That night, Jeff blows off Erin to drink with his brothers at a bar. Two patrons at the bar begin asking Jeff questions about the bombing insinuating that the event was a government conspiracy to start a war in Iran and Jeff was paid to look like a victim. Insulted Jeff and his brothers initiate a bar fight with the patrons. Erin picks him up later that night and tells him she's pregnant. Jeff begins to panic and tells her he isn't ready to be a father causing Erin to scold him for constantly running away from his problems. She leaves him in the car without removing his wheelchair from the trunk, enters their apartment, and packs her things. Jeff crawls to the apartment door and has a PTSD flashback of the bombing in its entirety.
Jeff meets with Carlos, a man who cared for him in the immediate aftermath of the bombing saving his life. Carlos tells him about his son, a marine who died in Iraq. After attempting suicide Carlos was forced to attend his son's funeral in a stretcher. His younger son, unable to cope with the death of his older brother and the constant state of pain his father was in, killed himself. Carlos confides that saving Jeff helped him make peace with the death of his sons and the blame he placed upon himself because of them. Jeff begins to understand that his will to live in the face of adversity is what both comforts and inspires people. He stops drinking and begins to take his rehab more seriously. He leaves Erin a voicemail apologizing for his behavior finally taking full responsibility for his immaturity and fear of commitment. A few days later he and Carlos throw out the first pitch at a Red Sox game where he meets Pedro Martinez. Erin watches at home and smiles. After the game dozens of people come up to Jeff and tell him how and why he has so heavily impacted their lives.
He and Erin meet at a diner where he walks with his prosthetics for the first time without assistance. He tells Erin he loves her, to which she replies ""Good."" He grabs her hand and smiles."
Battle of the Sexes,"The film dramatizes the events leading up to the 1973 match between Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) and Robert Larimore Riggs (Steve Carell), and their personal lives. King and Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman) confront Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman) who has announced a tennis tournament where the top prize for women is one-eighth of the men’s prize, despite equal ticket sales. King and Heldman threaten to start their own tour but Kramer won't alter the terms, citing the inferiority of women’s tennis. He later expels the women who join the new tour from the Lawn Tennis Association. The women's tour struggles until Heldman wins a lucrative sponsorship from Virginia Slims cigarettes. Billie Jean begins an affair with Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough), her hairdresser, threatening her marriage to Larry King (Austin Stowell).
Meanwhile, Riggs’ marriage to the wealthy Priscilla Wheelan (Elisabeth Shue) is in trouble because of his addiction to gambling.

King declines, but Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), who recently beat King in a match, accepts. Riggs easily defeats Court and King decides she has to accept his challenge, but demands a final say as to the arrangements. King trains intensely, while Riggs relaxes. King objects to Kramer as a game announcer, threatening to not play unless he withdraws, which he does. After a slow start, King wins the match."
Woodshock,"Theresa provides her terminally-ill mother with a cannibis joint laced with poison, allowing her to commit assisted suicide. After her mother's death, she inherits her home in rural Northern California. Theresa's boyfriend, Nick, wants her to move elsewhere with him, but she insists on staying in her mother's house. Theresa returns to her job at a cannabis dispensary owned by her friend Keith, but is noticeably withdrawn. She attends a house party with Keith, and talks with Johnny, a mutual friend who is younger than both of them.
One day while Theresa is working, a sick elderly man, Ed, comes into the shop to pick up the same poison-laced cannabis Theresa administered to her mother. Theresa gives him the cannabis and he leaves; aware that he is using it to commit suicide, Theresa experiences an emotional breakdown. Ed returns later in the evening, informing Theresa and Keith that the drug failed to work. In the middle of the night, Theresa receives a phone call from Keith. She meets him at a carwash, where he tells her that Johnny has died, and accuses her of accidentally selling Johnny the poison-laced cannabis intended for Ed.
Her grief now compounded by guilt, Theresa's emotional state becomes increasingly fragile, and she begins retreating to the surrounding woods for hours at a time, causing strain on her relationship with Nick. Contemplating suicide, she prepares five individual joints laced with the poison, but at first cannot bring herself to smoke them. Later that night, she goes into the woods and works up the nerve to smoke one of the joints, but it does not kill her; she awakens the next morning with scratches on her legs. She smokes a second joint in the morning, and has visions of herself walking through the wilderness. Later, she smokes the third joint, which induces powerful hallucinations, but does not kill her. When she returns to consciousness, she finds that she has dismantled a wooden fence outside the house, but has no recollection of doing so.
Later that night, Theresa meets with Keith at a local bar, and smokes a fourth joint. After, she drives to Ed's house and confesses to him how she inadvertently killed Johnny. After telling him the news, Ed dies in front of her. Upon returning home, she gets into a fight with Nick when she refuses to tell him where she has been. She eventually leaves and walks to Keith's house, visibly ill and vomiting. Keith, who perceives Theresa's guilt over the deaths of her mother and Johnny, suggests she confide in Nick. Theresa refutes the idea, and Keith threatens to call Nick on the phone. Theresa begins burning her fingertips on a hot clothes iron that Keith has left on. When he attempts to stop her, she attacks him, burning his face with the iron, and then beats him over the head with it numerous times, killing him.
Covered in blood, Theresa wanders into the woods and smokes the last of the poison-laced joints. This induces numerous visions of the landscape, during which Theresa begins levitating, and ascends into the tree canopy."
Victoria & Abdul,"Abdul Karim, a young prison clerk from Agra, India, is instructed to travel to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887 to present her with a mohur, a gold coin which has been minted as a token of appreciation from British-ruled India.
The Queen, who is lonely and tired of her fawning courtiers, develops an interest in and later a friendship with Abdul. She spends time with him alone, and promotes him to become her Munshi. She asks him to teach her Urdu and the Qur'an. When Victoria discovers that he is married, she invites his wife and mother-in-law to join him to England. They arrive wearing black Burqas, to the consternation of the household.
While Victoria treats Abdul as a son, his preferment is resented by her household and inner circle, including her son Bertie and the Prime Minister. The household plots to undermine their relationship, hoping that Abdul will be sent home. When Victoria embarrasses herself by recounting to the court the one-sided account of the Indian Mutiny that Abdul had told her, Victoria's faith and trust in him are shaken and she decides he must go home. But the following day she changes her mind and asks him to stay. She gives Abdul a bejewelled locket with her photograph.
Victoria's interest in India grows, and at her Isle of Wight home of Osborne House, she has the Durbar Room built for state functions, elaborately decorated with carvings by Bhai Ram Singh in an intricate style, and with a carpet from Agra. She hangs portraits of Indians in the House. She tells the household that she intends to give Abdul a knighthood.
The Prime Minister is adamant that the royal household must find a way to get rid of Abdul. They research his family background in India, and present Victoria with a dossier to show that his family is more ordinary and poor than Abdul has told her. When Victoria insists her doctor examine Abdul to find out why his wife has not fallen pregnant, he discovers that Abdul has gonorrhea, and rushes to tell the Queen, expecting her to dismiss him in disgust. However, Victoria remains loyal to Abdul and admonishes her courtiers for plotting against him.
Eventually the household decides that, if Victoria does not break with Abdul, they will all resign. They also threaten to certify Victoria as insane. When Victoria is told, she angrily summons the entire household to the Durbar Room and demands that anyone who wants to resign step forward. When none do so, she tells them she has decided not to make Abdul a knight, but to include him in her next honours list as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.
When Victoria falls ill, she urges Abdul to return to India, while she can still provide him with protection. She warns him that when she dies, the court will turn on him, but Abdul insists that he will stay with Victoria until the end of her life. In 1901, Victoria dies, and her son Bertie, now Edward VII, rejects Abdul, burning all the gifts and papers he has received from the Queen, and sending him and his family back to India. Abdul's wife manages to save the locket for him. It is revealed that Abdul lived in India until his death eight years later in 1909. The film ends with Abdul kneeling at a large statue of the Queen close to the Taj Mahal, talking to it and kissing its feet in respect."
Jeepers Creepers 3,"The film opens with a shuriken flying through the air and hitting a wooden post as a man runs for his life. When the man reaches the road, the Creeper drops from the sky and flies off with him, while another man watches from his truck. When he gets out to investigate, he looks up in the air and sees a first a machete and finally, a severed hand fall from the sky.
Twenty-three years later, shortly after the events of the first film, the police discover the Creeper's truck filled with dead bodies. The truck has been rigged with several booby-traps, including spikes that emerge from the bed of the truck, and a spear that shoots out from the tail-pipe. When Sheriff Dan Tashtego arrives, Sergeant Davis Tubbs tells him what happened and Tashtego informs him that the Creeper has been around for thousands of years and must be stopped. They then rush to get the Creeper's truck back after learning it is headed for the impound.
As Frank and Deputy Lang transport the vehicle, the Creeper lands on the tow truck and severs the cables. They then watch as the truck drives off seemingly on its own, while the Creeper stands on top of it. When the truck returns, the Creeper abducts Frank while Lang stands frozen in fear. The next day, Gaylen Brandon sees a vision of her son Kenny, who was killed by the Creeper twenty-three years earlier. He warns her that the Creeper will return soon to uncover something buried on the property and will kill anyone who is still there, including her and her granddaughter, Addison, when it does.
Meanwhile, Tashtego informs Tubbs that he has put together a small team to hunt down the Creeper and kill it once and for all. Later, a group of teenagers discover the Creeper's truck in a field. After finding the bodies, they take off on dirt bikes, but Kirk is shot in the leg with the spear. As two of the other boys try to free him, the Creeper returns and kills them both with another spear. The last boy is abducted by the Creeper as he tries to escape after peeing on the Creeper's truck.
Later, Addison goes into town to buy hay for her horse. When she can't pay for it, her friend Buddy helps her out and the two drive to a plantation house to deliver more hay. There they find the owner and a couple of men hiding under cars, but before they can get help the Creeper arrives and abducts Addison, leaving Buddy traumatized. Gaylen discovers a sack containing the Creeper's severed hand buried in her front yard, and when she touches it she goes into a hypnotic state.
When Tashtego and Tubbs arrive with the team, she reveals that the hand contains secrets about the Creeper's origins, and Tashtego decides to touch it to uncover a way to kill it. Addison wakes up in the Creeper's truck with Kirk, and together they try to find a way out, but when Kirk reaches for the door handle a metal pipe shoots out and impales him in the head.
Meanwhile, Tashtego and Tubbs discover the Creeper's location, and they head off to find him, along with Michael (who has a machine gun attached to his truck). They find the Creeper driving down the highway in his truck, but when they shoot at it, the bullets deflect, and Michael is killed. A small explosive is ejected from the bottom of the Creeper's truck, and when it goes off, Tashtego and Tubbs' car lands in a field. Tubbs gets out and tries to shoot the Creeper, but all of his attempts fail. However, before the Creeper can kill Tubbs, Tashtego calls him and he goes for him instead. When the Creeper jumps into the air, Tashtego shoots him several times with the machine gun, but the bullets have no effect and he is tackled to the ground and struck in the head with an axe.
That night, the Creeper discovers that Addison is still alive, but before he can kill her, she causes the metal pipe to shoot out and impale him in the head. She quickly escapes and runs through a field, and the Creeper throws a shuriken which barely misses her head. He then throws a spear at her, which also barely misses her. He tries one last time to hit her with an axe, but he is hit by a truck and Addison runs away. When the truck driver gets out to see what happened, he is killed by the Creeper. Addison runs and hides in a field where she is found by Gaylen and Buddy and the three leave together. The Creeper later returns to Gaylen's house where he finds a sign that says 'We know what you are', along with the hand, and yells out in anger.
The next day, Addison says goodbye to Buddy before he leaves for a high school basketball game in the same bus that is attacked by the Creeper in the second movie. Twenty-three years later, Trish Jenner is seen reading a letter she presumably wrote on a computer calling for people to fight against the Creeper when it returns, and vows to get revenge on the Creeper for the death of her brother, Darry."
American Made,"In the late 1970s, Barry Seal, a pilot for commercial airline TWA, is contacted by a CIA case officer, calling himself Monty Schafer. He asks Seal to fly clandestine reconnaissance missions for the CIA over Central America using a small plane with cameras installed.
Later in the 1970s, Schafer asks Seal to start acting as a courier between the CIA and General Noriega in Panama. During a mission, the Medellín Cartel picks Seal up and asks him to fly cocaine on his return flights to the United States. Seal accepts and starts flying the cartel's cocaine to Louisiana. The CIA turns a blind eye to the drug smuggling, but the DEA tracks Seal down. To avoid the authorities, Schafer moves Seal and his family to a remote town in Arkansas called Mena.
Later, Schafer asks Seal to run guns to the Nicaraguan Contras based in Honduras, Central America. Seal soon realizes that the Contras are not serious about the war and starts trading the guns to the cartel. The CIA sets up a Contra training base in Mena and Seal flies the Contras in, but many of them escape as soon as they arrive.
Seal's freeloading brother-in-law JB moves in, needing a job. Eventually, he starts stealing money from the Seals, is caught by Sheriff Downing with a briefcase full of laundered cash, and is arrested. Seal gives him money and a plane ticket to Bora Bora so he can leave. JB demands weekly cash and insults Lucy. Barry tries to chase him but JB's car explodes; it is implied Jorge Ochoa had JB's car rigged with explosives, killing him so that he would not snitch.
Eventually, the CIA shuts the program down and abandons Seal, who is arrested by the FBI, DEA, ATF and Arkansas State Police simultaneously. Seal escapes prosecution by making a deal with the White House, which wants evidence the Sandinistas are drug traffickers. They ask Seal to get photos that tie the Medellín Cartel to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. Seal manages to get the pictures, but the White House releases them as propaganda against the Sandinistas. Seal is prominently shown in the pictures, which leads to his arrest, and to the cartel plotting revenge.
Seal is convicted but given a light sentence, a total of 1,200 hours community service for the Salvation Army. Moving from motel to motel fails as a way of remaining in hiding because the community service is performed at the same building every night. Assassins sent by Pablo Escobar and the cartel easily locate Seal and kill him; the CIA then destroys all documentation and other evidence to avoid being implicated in drug smuggling. Even after Seal is dead and the evidence is destroyed, the CIA still becomes embroiled in the infamous Iran–Contra affair."
Flatliners,"A medical student, Courtney (Ellen Page), is obsessed with the idea of the afterlife, wanting to find out what happens after death. She invites fellow students Jamie (James Norton) and Sophia (Kiersey Clemons) to join her in an experiment, in an unused hospital room: using defibrillation to stop her heart for sixty seconds whilst recording her brain, and then reviving her. She assures them they would not be held responsible for any accidents. Sophia is against this, but Jamie does it anyway. After sixty seconds, they panic as they are unable to revive her, but eventually manage to with the help of fellow student Ray (Diego Luna). Later, Marlo (Nina Dobrev), a rival of Ray, arrives and learns of the experiment.
Initially Courtney begins to recall memories of past events such as her grandmother's recipe for bread. Courtney experiences increased intelligence and euphoria, being suddenly able to play the piano after 12 years and answer questions in class perfectly. Envious, Jamie flatlines, but has a disturbing near death experience as he meets his ex-girlfriend. Courtney and Jamie start seeing visions, but do not tell the others. Marlo and Sophia follow suit and flatline, for an increasing number of minutes. They experience similar positive results as Courtney.
It soon turns into a living horror as those who flatlined find themselves haunted by visions: Courtney is haunted by her dead sister Tessa from a car crash she caused because she was using her phone. Jamie is haunted by the baby of his ex-girlfriend whom he got pregnant and begged to get an abortion. Marlo is haunted by a man named Cyrus (who was stung by jellyfish) whom she killed when she accidentally mixed up his medication, and Sophia is haunted by a girl named Irina whose life she ruined out of jealousy by hacking her phone and sending out her nudes to make sure she was valedictorian. They realise there is a downside to flatlining.
Ray, the only one who didn't flatline, initially disbelieves what's happening. He tells everyone to stop the experiment immediately. The hauntings get more and more intense. Courtney, traumatised by her visions, records a message apologising for the consequences and admitting that her interest in flatlining was due to the death of her sister, not for scientific discovery. Shortly after, she is chased by visions of her dead sister and falls to her death from the fire escape of her apartment building after her sister's ghost appears in front of her and pushes her off. Marlo is suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Jamie is stabbed in the hand by his vision.
Marlo retrieves Courtney's phone that was found at the scene of her death. They watch Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes that they made and soon come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are their hallucinations because of their guilt from their past sins, not paranormal beings.
The group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Later, Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of the patient that died due to her mistake. Ray, Sophia, and Jamie rush to stop her and are successful in resuscitating Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. In the end, Marlo, Ray, Sophia, and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. The movie ends with Jamie proposing a toast, honoring Courtney."
Blade Runner 2049,"In 2049, replicants (described as ""bioengineered humans"") are slaves. K, a replicant, works for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as a ""Blade Runner"", an officer who hunts and ""retires"" (kills) rogue replicants. At a protein farm, he retires Sapper Morton and finds a box buried under a tree. The box contains the remains of a female replicant who died during a caesarean section, demonstrating that replicants can reproduce sexually, previously thought impossible. K's superior, Lieutenant Joshi, is fearful that this could lead to a war between humans and replicants. She orders K to find and retire the replicant child to hide the truth.
K visits the Wallace Corporation headquarters (the successor-in-interest in the manufacturing of replicants to the Tyrell Corporation, which went out of business) where the deceased female is identified from DNA archives as Rachael, an experimental replicant designed by Dr. Tyrell. K learns of Rachael's romantic ties with former blade runner Rick Deckard. Wallace CEO Niander Wallace wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction to expand interstellar colonization. He sends his replicant enforcer Luv to steal Rachael's remains from LAPD headquarters and follow K to Rachael's child.
At Morton's farm, K sees the date 6-10-21 carved into the tree trunk and recognizes it from a childhood memory of a wooden toy horse. Because replicants' memories are artificial, K's holographic AI girlfriend Joi believes this is evidence that K was born, not created. K burns down the farm and leaves. He searches the LAPD records and discovers twins born on that date with identical DNA aside from the sex chromosome but only the boy is listed as alive. K tracks the child to an orphanage in ruined San Diego, but discovers the records from that year to be missing. K recognizes the orphanage from his memories and finds the toy horse where he remembers hiding it.
Dr. Ana Stelline, a designer of replicant memories, confirms that his memory of the orphanage is real, leading K to conclude that he is Rachael's son. At LAPD headquarters, K fails a post-traumatic baseline test, marking him as a rogue replicant; he lies to Joshi by implying he killed the replicant child. Joshi gives K 48 hours to disappear. At Joi's request, K transfers her to a mobile emitter, an emanator. He has the toy horse analyzed, revealing traces of radiation that lead him to the ruins of Las Vegas. He finds Deckard, who reveals that he is the father of Rachael's child and that he scrambled the birth records to protect the child's identity; Deckard left the child in the custody of the replicant freedom movement.
After killing Joshi, Luv tracks K to Deckard's hiding place in Las Vegas. She kidnaps Deckard, destroys Joi and leaves K to die. The replicant freedom movement rescues K. Their leader Freysa informs him that Rachael's child is female and he is not Rachael's son. To prevent Deckard from leading Wallace to the child or the freedom movement, Freysa asks K to kill Deckard for the greater good of all replicants.
Luv brings Deckard to Wallace Co. headquarters to meet Niander Wallace. He offers Deckard a clone of Rachael for revealing what he knows. Deckard refuses and Luv kills the clone. As Luv is transporting Deckard to a ship to take him off-world to be interrogated, K intercepts and kills Luv but is severely injured in the fight. He stages Deckard's death to protect him from Wallace and the rogue replicants and leads Deckard to Stelline's office, having deduced that she is his daughter and that the memory of the toy horse is hers. As Deckard reunites with Stelline, K dies peacefully from his wounds."
The Mountain Between Us,"In January, after the cancellation of their flight out of Boise Airport to Denver, due to stormy weather, neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Bass (Idris Elba) and photojournalist Alex Martin (Kate Winslet) hire Walter (Beau Bridges), a local private pilot to get them to Salt Lake City, for connecting flights to Alex's wedding in New York (scheduled the following day) and Ben's emergency surgery appointment in Baltimore, Maryland. As they board a small plane, along with Walter's dog, Alex asks Walter if he has filed a flight plan, to which he says no, he doesn't need to, as ""... it's still light out ..."", they're flying VFR, and they'll beat the approaching storm. He tells them he flew combat missions in Vietnam, so unless somebody is shooting at them, they'll get there. Minutes after takeoff, Walter points out they're over the High Uintas Wilderness, 'a million acres of pure ass wilderness'. Alex notices the storm is ahead, as Walter suffers a stroke, causing the plane to crash on a mountaintop. Ben, Alex, and the dog survive, with various injuries, but Walter is killed.
Ben buries Walter and tends to Alex's wounds, realizing they must find civilization for any hope of survival. Alex asks Ben to leave her behind as he has a better chance of surviving without her, but Ben refuses. Instead, he climbs a peak to see if there are any structures nearby. On his descent, he nearly falls off a cliff face. Meanwhile, a cougar approaches the plane wreckage, and attacks and injures the dog. The cougar then approaches Alex within the plane wreckage, but she wounds it with a flare. Ben returns to find a blood trail and rushes to the plane. He treats the dog, and later retrieves the cougar's body and barbecues it for food.
Stranded for days with dwindling sustenance, Ben and Alex find strength in each other. Alex becomes skeptical that help will come, although Ben continues to insist they wait for help. After a heated argument, they both sleep, and Alex resolves that she will leave. At first light, she proceeds to leave the wreckage and start a descent down the mountain. Ben awakens, gives chase, and eventually catches up with Alex, and they make up over past grievances.
While making shelter in a cave, Alex uses her camera to locate a man-made structure and spots a reflective material flashing at her. They agree to make it down to this structure but on the way, they become separated from the dog. Ben goes after him and finds an abandoned cabin. As he looks through it, Alex feels the ground beneath her cracking. She realizes she is standing over thin ice, and she falls through into the ice cold water.
Ben hears the cracking, sees Alex fall, runs over, and pulls her out, but she is unconscious and almost blue. Ben brings her to the cabin and starts a fire to warm her up. He takes the risk of giving her an injection he resourcefully crafted out of materials in the cabin. A couple of days later, Alex eventually wakes up to the sound Ben makes with the piano in the cabin.
The first time Ben leaves Alex alone in the cabin, she goes through his personal things and again listens to a voicemail recording from his wife. Ben catches Alex in the act. She says she didn't mean to be nosy, but she just wants to know something about him, especially since he has disclosed so little about himself, and he never talks about his wife. He finally tells her his wife died two years ago from a brain tumor.
When Ben tells Alex he is going outside to get more wood for the fire, the culmination of all of their experiences together finally overcomes them. No longer able to resist each other, they have sex. As Ben sleeps afterward, Alex takes his picture.
Deciding they still won't make it, Alex again asks Ben to leave her behind to find help and return. Ben initially agrees but has regrets about leaving her behind. He returns once more, and they begin to press forward again. As they make their way down, Alex begins to tire quickly. However, Ben still refuses to leave her behind. They fall asleep in the woods. The dog wakes Ben, as it has found 'civilization', a timber yard just down the mountain.
Ben wakes Alex and they make their way towards it, but Ben gets his leg caught in a bear trap. Alex tries to help him, but can't, so she keeps going, reaches the yard, and collapses in front of an approaching truck. The truck driver comes to her aid.
Ben wakes up in hospital and goes to Alex's room, where he finds her with Mark, her fiancé. Mark praises Ben for saving Alex, to which Ben replies she saved him, and he leaves the room, heartbroken. Some time afterward, Mark tells Alex, ""I told myself that if you ever lost a part of you (an arm or leg in her dangerous job as a photojournalist), I would still love you."" But now, it's obvious to him that he has lost her heart.
Alex tries calling Ben, but he declines her phone calls until he receives pictures of him and Alex on the mountain. This encourages Ben to call Alex.
They meet at a restaurant in Manhattan, where it is revealed that Alex is now a part-time teacher who is uncomfortable flying, and Ben is now working as a consultant trauma clinics, as his frostbitten hands have not recovered sufficiently for him to operate. Ben admits that he did not call Alex back because he thought she would be married, and Alex responds that she couldn't go through with it; she fell in love with Ben while they were together on the mountain. After leaving the restaurant, Ben admits to Alex that they survived because they fell in love.
Alex dismisses her feelings and reminds Ben of what he said on the mountain: ""the heart is just a muscle."" They hug goodbye, and as they depart in opposite directions, they feel deep regrets, burst into tears, and run back into each other's arms."
My Little Pony: The Movie,"The ponies of Equestria prepare for their first Friendship Festival, overseen by Princess Twilight Sparkle in Canterlot. The festivities are interrupted by an invasion of monsters commanded by the broken-horned unicorn Tempest Shadow, who uses magical obsidian orbs to petrify Twilight's fellow princesses; Princess Celestia unsuccessfully urges Princess Luna to seek help from ""the queen of the hippo"" before being interrupted. Twilight flees the city alongside her five pony friends – Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Applejack, and Fluttershy – and her assistant dragon, Spike. Tempest gives pursuit under orders from her superior, the Storm King, to gather all of Equestria's princesses for him to harness their magic through his mystical staff, with the promise of having her horn restored in exchange.
Twilight's group travel to the desert city of Klugetown in search of the aforementioned ""hippos"". A feline con artist named Capper offers to escort the group, secretly intending to sell them to settle a debt; however, he develops a genuine friendship with them. Twilight discovers an atlas that reveals the ""hippos"" to be hippogriffs, exposing Capper's treachery. After the group evade Tempest aboard a delivery airship, Tempest brings Capper to guide her to them, but he deliberately misdirects her to atone for deceiving the group.
During a lunch break, the airship's birdlike Captain Celaeno and her crew reluctantly allow the group passage, revealing themselves to be former pirates that have been forced into the Storm King's service. Rainbow Dash persuades the pirates to defy orders, and take her group to the hippogriffs' kingdom on Mount Aris. In celebration, she performs a Sonic Rainboom that inadvertently gives their location away to Tempest, forcing the group to escape in a makeshift hot air balloon before Tempest destroys the ship with the pirates and Capper on board.
The group reach Mount Aris to find it deserted; while exploring the ruins, they become trapped in an underwater cavern, where they are saved from drowning by the seapony, Princess Skystar, and led to her undersea home of Seaquestria. Skystar identifies her kind as the hippogriffs, transformed by a magic pearl used by her mother, Queen Novo, to hide from the Storm King; Novo demonstrates by turning the ponies into seaponies and Spike into a pufferfish. When Novo denies them the pearl to use against the Storm King, Twilight desperately attempts to steal it while letting her friends unknowingly distract the seaponies. Pinkie Pie nearly changes Novo's mind until Twilight is caught, prompting the outraged queen to banish the entire group to the surface.
Abandoned by her friends over her actions, Twilight is abducted by Tempest, and brought before the Storm King in Canterlot to have her magic absorbed; Tempest gains Twilight's sympathy when she divulges how she lost her horn in a monster attack as a filly, which caused her own friends to shun her for her dangerously unstable magic. Meanwhile, after Spike alerts Twilight's friends to her capture, Capper, the pirates, and the hippogriff Skystar return to help them infiltrate Canterlot, and mount a rescue. The Storm King retaliates by conjuring a tornado in the city with his newly empowered staff, betraying Tempest as well. Twilight saves Tempest from the tornado, and reconciles with her friends, successfully working together with them to take the staff. The Storm King hurls an obsidian orb at the group to reclaim the staff, but Tempest jumps in his way, petrifying them both. The Storm King's body falls, and shatters, while the group use the staff's magic to revive Tempest, who returns the stolen magic to restore the princesses, and repair the damaged city.
The Friendship Festival resumes, and the ponies celebrate with all of the allies Twilight's group have made on their adventure. Tempest is disheartened by her still broken horn until she is convinced by Twilight to join the party by producing a fireworks display with her magic, happily accepting the group's friendship."
The Florida Project,"Six-year-old Moonee lives with her young mother Halley in the Magic Castle, a motel in Kissimmee, Florida near Walt Disney World. She spends most of her summer days unsupervised with her motel-resident friends Scooty and Dicky, engaging in mischief, mooching from tourists, stealing, and other misbehavior. After the three children are caught spitting on a guest's car, Dicky's father restricts him from playing with Moonee and Scooty. While cleaning up the guest's car they had spat on, Moonee meets Jancey, a child living at the Futureland motel next door, and invites her to hang out with them. Later on, Dicky's family relocates to New Orleans, which saddens the group. Bobby, the manager of Magic Castle, is protective of the children.
Halley, struggling to pay rent, hawks perfume to tourists in hotel parking lots and asks Scooty's mother, Ashley, to steal food for them from the diner where she works. However, Ashley cuts contact after discovering Moonee, Scooty, and Jancey set an abandoned condominium on fire.
Halley begins offering her services online as a prostitute, closing Moonee in the bathroom when she has a client. Bobby notices the activity and applies restrictions on unregistered guests in her motel room. When she steals a client's Disney resort passes to sell them, the man returns to demand them back; Bobby sees him off but warns Halley that he will evict her if the prostitution continues.
Desperate, Halley approaches Ashley to apologize and ask for money. When Ashley mocks her for her prostitution, Halley beats her in front of Scooty. The next day, Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) arrive to investigate Halley. She cleans up the room and gives away her cannabis, but remains defiant. She takes Moonee to a resort hotel restaurant, where they charge the meal to a guest's room. When they return to the motel, DCF and the police are waiting to take Moonee into foster care pending investigation. Moonee runs away to find Jancey, and together they run away to the Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World."
Brawl in Cell Block 99,"Former boxer and drug mule, Bradley Thomas (Vince Vaughn) goes to his current job at an auto-repair shop and discovers he has been laid-off by his employer. As he arrives home, he sees his wife, Lauren (Jennifer Carpenter), sitting in her car talking to someone on her cellphone. Bradley approaches her and sees a lovebite on her neck. Lauren confesses that she has been seeing somebody else. Bradley orders her inside the house before he violently dismantles her car with his bare hands. When calm, he enters the house to discuss with Lauren their failing relationship. Bradley decides to forgive Lauren and returns to work as a drug mule.
Eighteen months later, Bradley and a now pregnant Lauren have relocated to a larger, more expensive home. Bradley's boss, Gil (Marc Blucas), introduces him to Eleazar (Dion Mucciacito), a new business associate, and gives him a new task. Bradley is to sail off the coast with two of Eleazar's men to pick up a package of crystal meth. Bradley does not trust the larger of the two men, Roman (Geno Segers), but accepts the job when Gil offers him three months paternity leave. As they arrive at the pier, Bradley senses they are walking into a police trap and dumps his bag into the water. Bradley instructs the other two men to do the same, but they ignore his order and confront the police in a firefight, wounding three officers. Bradley intervenes by knocking out Roman in order to assist the police. The third drug trafficker dies in the shootout. Bradley is taken into custody and sentenced to seven years in a medium-security prison.
During the night, Lauren is kidnapped by men under orders of Eleazar. On the second day of his incarceration, Bradley is visited by the Placid Man (Udo Kier), who informs Bradley that he works for Eleazar. He tells Bradley that, unless Bradley assassinates an inmate named Christopher Bridge, located in Redleaf Correctional Facility, a separate maximum-security prison, the limbs of his unborn child will be surgically removed by a Korean abortionist and sent to him. Bradley reluctantly accepts.
Bradley picks a fight with multiple guards, until he's overpowered and transferred to Redleaf. There, he meets Warden Tuggs (Don Johnson), who subjects Bradley to a cavity search outside of the prison entrance. Bradley is put into a horrible cell, where the toilet is clogged with feces. Eventually, he is able to go outside for yard time. When a fellow inmate informs him that Christopher Bridge is not located in this section of the prison but in another section known as cell block 99, Bradley fights some other inmates and consequently is thrown into cell block 99.
Warden Tuggs explains that cell block 99 is where he devises special punishments for society's most despised criminals. Bradley is forced to wear a belt that gives him electric shocks at a push of a button, as a punishment for the fight. His cell in block 99 is lined with broken glass and only contains a crude squat toilet hole. Bradley speaks to the man in an adjacent cell, who informs him that Christopher Bridge does not exist at all. During the night, a young guard named Wilson (Tom Guiry) escorts Bradley to another, larger cell in block 99, where Eleazar, Roman, and two other gangsters are located. The gang torture Bradley with the electric belt, and taunt him by threatening to call the abortionist. He is shocked so badly that he needs to be dragged back to the cell unconscious.
Bradley devises a plan and tears the lining out of his shoes: he places the rubber between his body and the belt to prevent the shocks. This enables him to ambush Wilson and another guard; resulting in him killing Wilson. Bradley locks the second guard inside the cell. Bradley confronts Eleazar, and brutally kills all three henchmen in hand-to-hand combat: degloving the face of the first man, gouging the eyes and breaking the neck of the second, and stomping Roman's face in. During the brawl, Eleazar telephones the Placid Man and instructs him to activate the abortionist. Bradley first tortures Eleazar by breaking his leg, then calls The Placid Man to negotiate for Lauren's freedom. It is agreed that the Placid Man will deliver Lauren to Gil's house. Bradley drags Eleazar into his own cell, across the broken glass, to await confirmation of Lauren's freedom. Warden Tuggs and his men arrive at block 99, but Bradley threatens to kill his two hostages. Bradley states he is waiting for a phone call, and promises that he will surrender peacefully, exactly one minute after the call ends.
The Placid Man and the abortionist follow Eleazar's instructions and drive Lauren unharmed to Gil's house. As they drive away, Gil retrieves a hidden assault rifle and kills the Placid Man. Lauren then takes the rifle and shoots the abortionist. Gil phones Bradley to inform him that his family is finally safe. Bradley speaks to Lauren for the last time, and shares a few words with their unborn child.
Bradley destroys the cell phone, then reminds Warden Tuggs that he still has 60 seconds of freedom remaining. Bradley shoves Eleazar's face into the squat hole and stomps several times on his neck, decapitating Eleazar and leaving the head at the bottom of the toilet. Warden Tuggs and his men finally enter the cell. Bradley gives one last look at Tuggs, before he shoots Bradley twice, once in the chest and once in the head. The screen cuts to black on the third gunshot and Bradley's body hitting the floor is heard."
Happy Death Day,"Theresa ""Tree"" Gelbman wakes up on her birthday on Monday, September 18, 2017 in the dorm room of classmate Carter Davis after a drunken binge the previous evening. Tree goes through the day being self-centered, dismissive, and condescending to her classmates and previous hook-ups, ignoring her father's invitation to a restaurant, throwing away a birthday cupcake given to her by her roommate Lori Spengler, and having an affair with Dr. Gregory Butler, her professor. That night, while going to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel where she is brutally murdered by a hooded figure wearing a mask of the campus mascot.
Tree wakes up the next morning back in Carter's bed with the previous day's events repeating. Unnerved, she relives the day and avoids the tunnel, instead heading to a fraternity house for a surprise party. However, after becoming intimate with her classmate Nick, the masked killer murders him before killing Tree once more. Tree realizes that she is in a time loop and tries to avoid her death by barricading herself in her room. However, she is murdered again when the killer hides in her bedroom.
Upon waking up again, she relays her story to Carter, who suggests that she take advantage of the loop in order to figure out who her killer is. She spends the next several iterations trailing suspected classmates and getting killed each time.
After Tree is killed from being bludgeoned by the killer with a baseball bat, she passes out shortly after waking up. She awakens in the campus hospital where she learns that her body shows evidence of recovery from multiple, massive, traumatic injuries, meaning she has retained damage from her previous murders even after waking up fully healed every time. Tree escapes the hospital room only to be chased by the killer until she manages to flee in Butler's car. While driving, she is pulled over by a police officer and volunteers to be arrested in order to be spared. While held in the officer's squad car, the killer runs over the officer and blows up the squad car by igniting the fuel tank with a candle.
Waking up in Carter's bed again, Tree convinces Carter of her predicament by showing that she holds foreknowledge of the day's events. In Corky's, Tree admits to Carter that she does not like who she has become as she is distant from her father in the wake of her mother's death three years ago. Tree catches a local news report on John Tombs, a serial killer who is being held in the hospital on her campus. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, Tree rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs snaps Carter's neck before chasing Tree to a nearby bell tower where she manages to subdue him with a crowbar. Realizing that Carter will remain dead if she doesn't restart the loop, Tree hangs herself in the tower.
During the next iteration, Tree sets out to be a kinder person by ending her affair with Dr. Butler and meeting with her father to resolve her inner grief. That night, she prepares to stop Tombs. He manages to get the upper hand on her until Tree utilizes a campus-wide blackout that occurs during the loop to disarm him and shoot him to death. Relieved to finally be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake given to her by Lori.
However, the next morning Tree wakes up again on her birthday. Confused and distraught over the fact that killing Tombs did not stop the time loop, Tree returns to her room where Lori offers the cupcake again. Tree learns that she had died in her sleep and also notes that this was the only time she had ever eaten the cupcake. Tree realizes that Lori is the true killer; Lori had poisoned the cupcake, but when Tree did not eat it, she utilized her job as a nurse in the hospital to frame Tombs for Tree's murder by drugging him. Tree tries to coerce Lori to have a bite and when Lori refuses, Tree decides to take it to the police. Lori lunges at Tree, locks the door and confesses that she was jealous of her affair with Dr. Butler before engaging a fight. Tree manages to stuff the cupcake into Lori's mouth before kicking her out of a window, sending her falling to her death. Tree and Carter muse over the day's events back in the restaurant. He offers her his room for the night, also commenting her situation is a lot like the film Groundhog Day. Tree wakes up the next day believing herself to be in another loop, but it turns out to be a prank by Carter. The two share a kiss."
Marshall,"In 1940, Thurgood Marshall is an NAACP lawyer travelling the country defending people of color who are wrongly accused of crimes because of racial prejudice. Upon his return to his New York office, he is sent to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell, a chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer, Eleanor Strubing, in a case that has gripped the newspapers. In Bridgeport, insurance lawyer Sam Friedman is assigned by his brother to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, against his will. At the hearing, Judge Foster, a friend of the father of prosecutor Lorin Willis, agrees to admit Marshall, but forbids Marshall from speaking during the trial, forcing Friedman to be Spell's lead counsel. Marshall must guide Friedman through notes, such as when he advises Friedman to allow a woman of Southern white descent into the jury because of her assertive and questioning personality.
Spell swears to Marshall that he never had any sexual contact with Strubing, and leads the lawyers to a patrolman who stopped Spell that night while he was driving Strubing's car. Marshall and Friedman investigate Strubing's story that Spell tied her up in the back seat of her car after raping her, and then drove to a bridge to throw her over. They wonder why Spell appeared to throw her over the calm side instead of the side with rapids. Spell is initially interested in a plea bargain offered by Willis, but Marshall talks him out of it. Later on at trial, though, a doctor testifies to finding pieces of skin underneath Strubing's fingernails, as well as bruises. Strubing herself testifies that she was tied in the back seat when the patrolman pulled Spell over. With this information, Marshall and Friedman confront Spell, who admits that he was lying about not having sexual contact with Strubing.
At trial, Spell testifies that Strubing's husband inflicted the bruises through repeated acts of spousal abuse. That night, he went to see Strubing for an advance on his salary, finding a distraught Strubing wanting to have sex with him. Spell consents, and the two have several sexual encounters that night, with Spell getting scratched by Strubing. But then Strubing panics about being found out and being pregnant. Spell tries to drive her to a doctor, but Strubing has to hide in the back seat when the patrolman questions him. A hysterical Strubing forces Spell to stop by a bridge where she runs out and tries to kill herself by jumping off. But she survives and flags down a motorist making up a desperate story about rape. When Willis asks why Spell didn't tell the truth to begin with, Spell talks about how black men get lynched in his native Louisiana for having sex with white women. Over Willis's objections, Judge Foster allows Spell's statement to stand.
Before the verdict, Marshall has to leave for a case in Mississippi. A desperate Willis offers Spell a much lighter plea bargain, but Spell feels emboldened enough to turn it down. The night before Marshall leaves, he and Friedman prepare the closing statement that Friedman then delivers on his own. The Southern white woman has now become the jury forewoman, and she ultimately delivers a ""not guilty"" verdict. Friedman happily breaks the news over the phone to Marshall, who moves on to his next case. Closing credits note that Friedman went on to work in many civil rights cases, while Marshall himself has an illustrious career as the American Civil Rights Movement's principle legal strategist and the first African-American Justice to the Supreme Court of the United States."
Breathe,"Robin Cavendish falls ill from polio at age 28, not long after meeting and marrying his wife Diana. Paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe without the assistance of a respirator, he is given only three months to live. Initially he is depressed, refusing to see his wife or newborn son Jonathan and wishing to be removed from life support, but Diana is persistent, and slowly his spirits improve. When Diana realizes she can provide for his daily care and suggests they move Robin and the respirator home, Robin brightens considerably. Over the strenuous objections of the hospital's administrator Dr. Entwistle (who tells Diana that he will die if without the ventilator for two minutes) and with the help of some of the other doctors and nurses, Robin is brought home and meets his son.
While Jonathan is playing, he knocks out the plug of the ventilator. Robin sees, but unable to move or speak, he cannot get Diana's attention, so instead makes clicking noises with his tongue. Eventually, Diana finds him and plugs it back in.
Seeing his son push a pram gives Robin the idea for a mobile chair with a built-in respirator, so he enlists the help of his friend Teddy Hall to build one. Using the chair, and with the help of Diana and her two brothers, Robin is able to travel away from home for the first time, and with a specially constructed van, the family begins to venture out further, even flying the van on a cargo plane to Spain.
Teddy makes various improvements to his design over time, and eventually Robin teams up with Don McQueen to produce more of the chairs. After observing a German hospital's prison-like confinement of their severely disabled patients, Robin then appears at a conference and appeals to doctors to treat their patients more humanely, drawing a standing ovation. Robin returns to his original hospital with more of Teddy's chairs, and the rest of the patients in the ward leave with him.
Years later, Robin begins to experience severe bleeding due to his extended time on the respirator, and decides it is time to stop prolonging his life indefinitely. He holds a farewell party with his many friends, and sometime later, instructs his family to leave the house and return at precise times. Diana and Jonathan, now in his twenties, see McQueen driving away, and return to the house. Fading, Robin expresses his love for both of them, and dies, having transformed the lives of many others like him.[3]"
Goodbye Christopher Robin,"The film begins during WWII in 1941, with Alan Alexander Milne – nicknamed ""Blue"" by his friends and family – and his wife Daphne receiving a distressing telegram at their home. It then changes time frame to 1916 during WWI with Blue fighting in the Battle of the Somme. He resumes his life with his wife, Daphne, in England while suffering shell shock with occasional flashbacks to his battle experiences and having a child with Daphne. She was hoping for a girl and is disappointed to instead have a son, whom they name Christopher Robin Milne but call ""Billy Moon"" after he mispronounces his last name. They hire a nanny, Olive, whom Billy calls ""Nou"".
Blue is having difficulty resuming his writing – he wants to draft a compelling treatise against the war – and relocates the family to a house in the country with wooded acreage. Daphne resents the move and returns to London for a few weeks. During that period, Nou goes to care for her dying mother and the cook takes some time off, leaving Blue and Billy to fend for themselves. Reluctantly at first, Blue takes Billy along on walks in the woods and begins making up stories about the boy's adventures with the stuffed animals the parents have bought for him along the way.
Blue invites his illustrator friend Ernest to join them at the house, and together they begin to develop the Winnie-the-Pooh books. Daphne returns to the house after Blue sends her a poem ""Vespers"", that she has published in Vanity Fair. Nou returns following her mother's death. After the Winnie-the-Pooh books become a success, Daphne manages their newfound celebrity. As Christopher Robin, Billy makes frequent public appearances which he finds confusing and frustrating. After Billy tells his parents Nou has a beau, Alfred, she becomes angry with them, resigns, and admonishes Blue and Daphne for what they are putting Billy through. Blue resolves to stop writing about the boy and his imaginary friends.
Blue ends Billy's publicity activities and enrolls him at a boarding school. ""Christopher Robin"" is bullied at the school and emerges bitter toward his father. When WWII breaks out, Billy is initially declared unfit for the draft, but he demands that his well-connected father – despite being horrified by war and the prospect of his son experiencing what he did – convince the army to accept him regardless. Billy leaves for service, turning his back on his father and disowning the books and the money from them.
The opening scene is replayed, this time explaining that Billy has been reported missing and is presumed dead – news his parents pass along to Nou. However, Billy has survived and arrives at the country house without warning, leading to awkward but tearful reunions with his parents and Nou. Blue and Billy have a reconciliation of sorts, and they are seen walking in the woods as a young child and younger man."
Professor Marston and the Wonder Women,"The story is told in flashbacks set during a 1945 testimony that William Moulton Marston gives to representatives of the Child Study Association of America. In the year 1928, William and his wife Elizabeth teach and work on their research at Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges. One day, William hires one of his students, Olive Byrne (daughter of Ethel Byrne and niece of Margaret Sanger – two famous suffragists and feminists of the 20th century) as a research assistant. Olive aids in the Marstons' work in inventing the lie detector and conducting research on William's DISC theory on human interactions, and the three soon grow close. One after another tests by the lie detector reveal that they have fallen in love with one another, and all three of them begin to engage in a polyamorous relationship.
As words about their unconventional relationship gets out, the Marstons are fired from the university. Olive reveals that she is pregnant and moves in with the Marstons shortly after. The trio decide to build a family together and create a fabrication to keep secret the nature of their relationship. The family settle in a New York suburb, happily together. By 1934, both Elizabeth and Olive bear children by William (Olive has two sons and Elizabeth has one son and a daughter), telling the neighbors that Olive is a widow and taken in by the Marstons. William starts trying to make a living as an author. Elizabeth takes a job as a secretary and becomes the main breadwinner of the family. Olive stays at home and takes care of the kids, occasionally submitting her writing samples to publishers. They raise their four children together, and Elizabeth names her daughter after Olive.
In 1940, William stumbles upon a lingerie shop in New York City run by Charles Guyette, who introduces him to fetish art themed comics and photos. The art captures William's imagination as a demonstration of his DISC theory. Elizabeth initially disapproves of the art, but she relents during a presentation wherein Olive tries out an outfit that later would be the prototype for Wonder Woman's costume.
After finding limited work as a writer, Marston comes up with the idea of creating a female Amazonian super-heroine for comic book. The comic would feature his ideas on DISC theory, drawing inspiration from the Marstons' work on the lie detector as well as Elizabeth and Olive in real life, and intend to support the feminist movement to further equal rights for women through a populist medium. He pitches his ideas to Max Gaines, then publisher at National Periodical Publications (today DC Comics), who ultimately accepts the comic and suggests simplifying the female superhero's name to ""Wonder Woman."" ""Wonder Woman"" is an instant hit, leading to prosperity for the Marstons/Byrne family. However, one day, their neighbor Mary wanders into their home by coincidence and walks into the three of them having sex. This incident leads to their children getting bullied and asked to leave school by the staff. Worried about their children being attacked and ostracized, and thinking they have no other choice, Elizabeth reluctantly demands Olive to leave the household with her children. At the same time, the ""Wonder Woman"" comic gets growing accusations of featuring overtly sexual, sadomasochistic, and lesbian imagery that lead to the testimony of the present day.
Leaving the testimony, William collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Learning that he is dying of cancer, William asks Olive to see him and Elizabeth again, trying to help them reconcile. William persuades Elizabeth to submit to Olive as she should not always dominate in their relationship. The Marstons get on their knees and beg for Olive's forgiveness, and Elizabeth tearfully admits that she cannot live without Olive. She eventually agrees to come back to them.
Epilogue text reveals that William died in 1947. Elizabeth and Olive continued to live together as a couple for another 38 years until Olive's death in 1985, and Elizabeth lived to be 100. It also notes that sexual imagery disappeared from the ""Wonder Woman"" comic after William's death, along with Wonder Woman's super powers. Wonder Woman was finally reclaimed by famous activist Gloria Steinem in 1972, when she put the character on the cover of the first issue of Ms. Magazine as the quintessential symbol of female empowerment.
The credits conclude that ""Wonder Woman remains the most famous female superhero of all time."""
Blood Money,"During a weekend excursion in the woods, three friends, Victor (Ellar Coltrane), his ex-girlfriend Lynn (Willa Fitzgerald) and Jeff (Jacob Artist), who's secretly sleeping with Lynn, discover four bags full of money. They discover that it belongs to a criminal named Miller (John Cusack), who is looking for it.
During their getaway, Jeff is entangled with one of the bags of money. With Miller pulling him in one direction, and Lynn refusing to let go of the money, Jeff dies. During the finale, Victor falls and Lynn has hid the money in an abandoned mill. Miller confronts Lynn at the mill and Lynn tries to negotiate with him, saying that if he gives her some of the money, she will tell him where the rest is hidden. Lynn distracts Miller long enough for Victor to hit him from behind with a pipe. Lynn grabs the pipe and begins hitting Miller multiple times in the head, killing him. Lynn grabs Miller's gun and points it at Victor. She tells him that she is sorry, before she pulls the trigger, killing him.
The final shot of the film is Lynn, walking out of the mill, dragging the money back to civilization."
Geostorm,"In 2019, following many catastrophic natural disasters, an international coalition commissions a system of climate-controlling satellites called ""Dutch Boy"". After Dutch Boy neutralizes a typhoon in Shanghai, a Senate sub-committee reprimands chief architect Jake Lawson for acting without authorization and replaces him with his brother Max, who works under Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom.
Three years later in 2022, as a UN team stationed in the Registan Desert comes across a frozen village, Makmoud Habib, an engineer working on the International Climate Space Station (ICSS) copies data from the Afghanistan satellite onto a hard drive before being ejected into space. After convincing President Andrew Palma to conduct an investigation, Max persuades Jake to go to the ICSS to investigate. Another satellite increases temperatures in Hong Kong, causing a firenado that nearly kills Max's college friend Cheng Long, the head of Dutch Boy's Hong Kong department.
Jake arrives at ICSS to examine the malfunctioning satellites (which are damaged afterwards and their data erased) with station commander Ute Fassbinder and her crew. Outside the ICSS, they retrieve the hard drive, but hide it from the crew, suspecting a traitor, and recover the data, discovering that a virus has wiped out everyone's login access to the satellite and is causing the malfunctions. Suspecting Palma is using Dutch Boy as a weapon, Jake tells Max he needs to reboot the system, which requires the kill code, held by Palma. The ICSS staff neutralize malfunctioning satellites by deliberately knocking them offline via collisions with replacement satellites.
Back on Earth, Cheng discovers he and Max have lost login access and warns Max of a global cataclysm known as a ""Geostorm"" if the malfunction continues. Cheng is pursued to Washington, D.C. by a team of rogue government agents, who ultimately cause his death in a traffic incident, but not before he says ""Zeus"", Discovering Project Zeus simulates extreme weather patterns to create a Geostorm, Max enlists his girlfriend, Secret Service agent Sarah Wilson, to acquire the code.
During the Democratic National Convention in Orlando, Max discovers Orlando is next to be targeted after a massive hailstorm hits Tokyo and part of Rio de Janeiro freezes over. He requests Dekkom's help, but Dekkom instead tries unsuccessfully to kill Max, unveiling himself as the saboteur; Max immediately informs Sarah. The two kidnap Palma to protect him from Dekkom's agents and secure the kill code, which is Palma's biometrics. As they escape from the DNC stadium before a lightning storm destroys it, Max reveals their activities and Dekkom's treachery to Palma. After outsmarting Dekkom's mercenaries, the three arrest and confront Dekkom about his intentions: to decimate America's fellow governments and line of succession, dominating the world.
The ICSS team loses control of all operations as the virus initiates the self-destruct program. As more disasters strike around the world (including tornadoes in Mumbai, a heatwave in Moscow and a tsunami in Dubai), Jake realizes software engineer Duncan is the traitor. In the ensuing confrontation, Duncan accidentally ejects himself into space while Jake escapes. As the crew evacuates, Jake stays behind to ensure the reboot completes. Max and Sarah escort Palma to the Kennedy Space Center, where they transmit the code but learn that the self-destruct sequence can't be stopped. Jake and Ute, who also stayed behind, work together to reboot the system, transferring satellite control to the world's space agencies and preventing the Geostorm at the last second. The two take shelter in a replacement satellite as the self-destruction sequence completes and use its thrusters as a beacon. A nearby shuttle piloted by crew member Hernandez picks them up. Six months later, Jake works as the head engineer for a new system of satellites, which is now administered by an international committee."
Only the Brave,"Eric ""Supe"" Marsh, the superintendent of the Prescott Fire and Rescue Crew 7 in Prescott, Arizona, receives a call to assist in the Cave Creek Complex fire north of Phoenix. Due to Crew 7's status as type 2, Eric's careful observation of the fire and his prediction that it will change direction and threaten a nearby neighborhood is ignored by a hot shot crew from California that arrives and takes command. The fire behaves as Marsh anticipated and the neighborhood is destroyed. Eric's wife Amanda suggests he talk to Duane Steinbrink, the city's fire chief, to complete his crew's certification and become hotshots. Duane agrees to set up an evaluation for Crew 7 to obtain their certification, but warns that the crew will likely have to commit to a longer working season in order to make their certification more attractive to the city council. This frustrates Amanda, who resents the already-high amount of focus Eric places on fighting fires, and wants to start a family with her husband.
Meanwhile, Brendan McDonough is unemployed, lives at home, and uses drugs recreationally. He finds out from a friend that his ex-girlfriend Natalie is pregnant and that the baby is his. He confronts her about hiding the pregnancy, but due to his irresponsible lifestyle, she tells him to leave her and the baby alone. Afterward, Brendan is thrown out of a bar and gets arrested for possession. After posting his bail, Brendan's mother kicks him out of the house. Brendan's daughter McKayla is born, but he is still kept at arm's length by Natalie. Wanting to provide for his daughter, he interviews for a job with Crew 7 and is hired despite the reservations of some of the crew. Brendan begins buying groceries and leaving them on the doorstep of Natalie's house.
During training, a wildfire breaks out and Crew 7's evaluation is scheduled. Despite the presence of rookies on the team and a clash of opinion between Eric and the crew's evaluator, Crew 7 passes and becomes the Granite Mountain Hot Shots. Natalie begins to open up to Brendan and agrees to let him spend time with their daughter.
The crew successfully fights several fires, including saving a historic juniper tree, but Brendan is bitten by a rattlesnake while walking the fire line. He is taken to the hospital for treatment but declines the recommended painkillers to avoid a potential relapse. Brendan's roommate and fellow hot shot Chris MacKenzie visits him in the hospital. He is immediately attracted to Brendan's nurse and they begin a relationship. Natalie, McKayla, and Brendan's mother also visit, the latter of whom suggests that Brendan reconsider his career for his daughter's sake. While out with the crew celebrating their recent success, Brendan approaches Eric about transferring to a structure fire crew, angering Eric. He reminds Brendan that his criminal past makes a transfer unlikely if not outright impossible, and he will likely relapse without the sense of purpose being a hot shot provides.
On the way home, Eric and Amanda argue about Eric's attitude about Brendan's sense of priorities and his own reluctance to start a family. Eric gets out of the car and walks to Duane's house where Eric tells Duane about an experience he had fighting a fire in Montana. Eric describes his memory of a bear that ran past him on fire, calling it ""the most beautiful and terrible thing I've ever seen."" Afterwards, he returns home and tells Amanda he's ready to start a family.
The next morning, Eric receives a call about a fire in Yarnell. He calls in the crew and, on the way to the fire, tells his second-in-command Jesse Steed that he will be stepping down as superintendent at the end of the fire season and that Jesse can have the job if he wants it. The crew deploys to protect Yarnell from the fire, and Eric tells Brendan that he will help him secure a transfer so he can spend more time with his family. The crew begins a controlled burn to contain the fire, but an air tanker mistakes the burn for a secondary fire and extinguishes it. The crew is forced to relocate and make a new fire line, and Brendan is sent to higher ground to serve as a weather lookout. The wind shifts and picks up speed, sending the fire toward Brendan and the crew. Brendan evacuates with the help of another hot shot crew member who gives him a ride to the staging area, and Brendan drives one of their vehicles back to the mobile fire headquarters. The rest of the crew begin to make their way to their designated safe zone.
The fire picks up speed and overtakes the safe zone before the crew can reach it. As Brendan listens on the radio, the hot shots prepare a deployment site and call in an air tanker to cover their position. The tanker overflies the crew, and they deploy their fire shelters. The fire then overtakes the hot shots. Multiple radio calls go out to the Granite Mountain crew. There is no response.
Brendan hears the radio call when the deployment site is discovered and it is confirmed that there are no survivors. The families of the fallen hot shots gather at a local school gymnasium, and word gets out amongst the families that one crew member survived, but they are not told who. Brendan demands to go to the gymnasium and enters to see the families in despair once they realize that Brendan is the lone survivor and their loved ones are dead. Brendan, suffering from survivor's guilt, collapses outside. Amanda follows him and tells him that she is glad he's alive.
Later, Brendan takes his daughter to the juniper tree that was saved by the crew earlier and remembers his fellow hot shots."
Boo 2! A Madea Halloween,"The film opens after school on Tiffany's 18th birthday. She and her friend Gabriella encounter Tiffany's dad Brian and brother B.J. outside the school. It seems that Brian always picks her up from school on her birthday wearing a birthday hat. Tiffany's mom, Brian's ex-wife Debrah, arrives and she and her new husband Calvin surprise Tiffany with the car she wanted (and hoped her father would give her), but she can't drive it well. She and Gabriella drive it to the frat house, where they hear that Jonathan and the others are having a Halloween party at Lake Derrick. She hopes to make it up to them for ruining the previous year's party. Jonathan invites her.
Brian finds Madea, Joe, Bam, and Hattie at his house to surprise Tiffany; she's underwhelmed. She sees her friend Leah and tells her about the party. Tiffany asks her mom if she can go to the party. She says yes to upset Brian, but he lets her go there to teach her a lesson.
Madea overhears Tiffany's conversation about the party and gets her friends to go with her to Lake Derrick to get Tiffany. Meanwhile, Tiffany rounds up Gabriella, Leah, and Anna (a girl who's stalking Horse) and they arrive at Lake Derrick in her new car. The frat boys meet up and have fun with the girls until frat boys disappear after seeing ""Derrick"", his brother, and his daughters.
On their way up to Lake Derrick, Joe and the ladies' argue to Madea about why she is taking them with to Lake Derrick instead of taking them home. Hattie decides to get out of the car and walk, but changes (she says ""shanged"") her mind.
While driving, Madea accidentally hits one of Derrick's daughters with her car when she mysteriously appears on the road; the gang argue over who will get out of the car and check on the little girl. Madea goes, and Bam and Hattie reluctantly follow. The little girl is crying. Madea says that they must go check on her, but Bam and Hattie are afraid to go check, but do so anyway. She pulls her hair and shows her face, which has scars, cuts, to everybody. The ladies run back to the car and Joe decides to drive. The little girl appears on top of the car, scaring everyone again, and Joe immediately drives away.
Back at Lake Derrick, Tiffany, Gabriella, Leah, and the remaining frat boys are at the campfire discussing the murders that happened in the area but Gabriella doesn't want to hear this and insist on leaving. They soon realize that some people from the party are missing, so Horse and Leah agree to look for them, but they actually want to get away to have sex. ""Derrick"" and his family chase them into the woods; running for their lives they trip and fall, giving ""Derrick"" a chance to grab Horse and drag him away from Leah. Leah says she'll get help but Horse is presumably ""killed."" Leah runs out of the forest and sees Madea and the gang waiting for the Cadillac to stop smoking so she waits with them until Bam sees a ""grim reaper"" standing in the middle of the road. Everyone except Madea is afraid; Madea thinks the frat boys are pranking them so she confronts him. She touches his scythe and gets a cut on her hand. She tries to touch his face, but when she just feels air she goes back to the car. The Grim Reaper follows and slashes one of the Cadillac's tires, but Joe continues to drive it anyway.
Gabriella reluctantly seeks safety in a tent with Dino, a frat brother who had been flirting with her all night, but they discover ""Derrick"" and his daughters outside the tent. In another tent Tiffany hooks up with Jonathan until ""Derrick"" tears down the tent. Tiffany, Gabriella, Jonathan, and Dino escape from the camp after Tiffany tries unsuccessfully to call her mom. Madea's group finally arrive at Lake Derrick, but the camp is empty. In the car Joe flirts with Leah until she run away after seeing Derrick's daughter at the car, and Joe makes rude comments to the little girl. While they are looking for Tiffany, Madea and Hattie go to an outhouse where Hattie relieves herself. Madea waits, but Derrick appears out of the river and she runs away. Hattie also runs away when the little girl appears and tries to grab her.
At the police station Debrah and Calvin desperately ask the sheriff to check for Tiffany at Lake Derrick but Brian shows up and tells Debrah that he will go look for her with his friend Victor, Gabriella's dad. Madea's car stops in front of a old broken-down house. Madea, Bam, and Hattie run into the house when they see the little girl who tells Joe that ""Derrick"" wants to talk him about the rude comments he made earlier. Joe goes to the chainsaw killer, but Joe runs away from him. Madea, Bam, and Hattie discover that Tiffany, Jonathan, Gabriella, Leah, and Dino are hiding in the house from Derrick too and think the adults are pranking them. At the window Madea, Bam, and Hattie think Joe is dead when they see ""Derrick"" and his brother drag him away so they try to come up with a plan to save everyone but the ladies argue until the little girl reappears, scaring everyone out of the house. Brian and Victor are waiting for them - they had been pranking them for lying and sneaking out, and for Debrah to learn to co-parent. Debrah agrees, and the people who were ""killed"" are found at the police station. However, the masked chainsaw killer at the outhouse wasn't part of the prank; he is the actual Derrick. When Brian and Victor realize this, they drive away from the camp. Joe then appears and it appears that he befriended the chainsaw killer. He then asks if he can help him kill Madea and he responds yes. After the screen cuts to black, a blooper reel appears."
Same Kind of Different as Me,"After Ron Hall (Greg Kinnear), a selfish successful art dealer, admits to cheating on her, his wife Deborah (Renée Zellweger) forces him to volunteer at a homeless shelter. There Denver Moore (Djimon Hounsou), a homeless ex-convict, helps him to change his life."
Leatherface,"At the Sawyer homestead, a birthday party is being held by the family matriarch Verna Sawyer (Lili Taylor) for the youngest member of the Sawyer family, Jedidiah. As his birthday present and to induct him into the murderous family rituals, he is presented with a chainsaw and is urged to slaughter a man who they have accused of attempting to steal from them. Jed refuses, visibly disturbed, and the victim is instead killed by Grandpa Sawyer.
In 1955, couple Betty Hartman and Ted Hardesty are driving down a country road when they come across the seemingly wounded Jedidiah Sawyer. Betty follows him to a dilapidated barn, where she is promptly killed by the Sawyer family. Her father, Sheriff Hartman (Stephen Dorff), is called to the crime scene, where he is shocked to find his daughter deceased. Despite the efforts of Verna, Hartman quickly takes Jedidiah into custody as revenge, sending him to a mental institution known as the Gorman House Youth Reformery.
Ten years later, recently-hired nurse Elizabeth White (Vanessa Grasse) forms a bond with patients Bud and Jackson (Sam Strike) at the Gorman House. Verna arrives later that night with an injunction to allow family visitation for a now teenage Jedidiah, only to be rejected by the director of the facility, Doctor Lang (Chris Adamson). On the way out, she violates security, causing a riot during which many of the nurses and patients are killed. Elizabeth is saved by Jackson, who gets her outside to safety where the two are taken hostage by crazed escapees Ike (James Bloor) and Clarice. As they leave, they come across a bloodied Bud, having just killed Director Lang in a fit of rage, and decide to take him with them.
The group arrives at a rest stop diner shortly after changing clothes. Following an altercation with waitress Tammy, Ike and Clarice begin a murder spree within the diner in which Bud is injured and the group is forced to flee. Hartman arrives on the scene with Deputy Sorells (Finn Jones) and discovers that one of the escaped inmates is in fact Jedidiah. That night, the escapees take refuge in an abandoned mobile home where Clarice and Ike engage in sexual intercourse, revealing her scarred body and involving the corpse of the former home owner in the debauchery. While everyone is asleep, Elizabeth tries to escape but is stopped by Ike. Ike continually insults Bud, provoking him to brutalize him to death when the others aren't around. The next morning, Clarice notices Ike is missing and heads off to find him; Jackson and Elizabeth find Bud sleeping on Ike's corpse and quickly take him away.
Clarice wanders into the woods in search of Ike and is apprehended by Hartman. Upon disparaging both him and his dead daughter, she is shot in the head as the others watch from a distance. Jackson and Bud continue on with Elizabeth in tow. As a Deputy passes, Elizabeth screams out, inadvertently leading to Bud getting shot. Bud's death sends Jackson into a rage, as he kills the Deputy and has Elizabeth drive them in the deputy's vehicle in attempt to reach safety. During their drive, the two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on them with one of the bullets severing Jackson's face and causing the vehicle to careen off the side of the road. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah at the old barn where Betty was killed. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and then gathers the family to converge on Hartman's location. At the barn, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is soon incapacitated by the other Sawyers.
Back at the Sawyer home, Verna stitches the remnants of the mentally-scarred Jedidiah Sawyer's face and applies a muzzle to hold them together. She then leads him into a room where his siblings are holding Elizabeth and Hartman captive. She gifts Jedidiah with his original chainsaw and Elizabeth watches on in horror as he bisects Hartman to death. As the family celebrates, Elizabeth flees into the woods while the Sawyers give chase. She nearly escapes, only to be caught in a bear trap. Elizabeth attempts to appeal to Jedidiah's sympathy, while Verna encourages him to kill her to protect their family. Jedidiah begins to listen to Elizabeth's pleas that he is not a killer, unable to recall events prior to his injury, until she insults Verna. This causes him to decapitate her in retaliation.
The next morning, Verna burns the evidence of the prior night's events and the other Sawyers feed the remains of their victims to the pigs. In the house basement, Jedidiah crafts Hartman's and Elizabeth's flesh into a mask and dons it to a mirror as he applies lipstick. The film ends with him smashing the mirror at the sight of his reflection.[Note 1]"
Wonderstruck,"The film interlaces two stories set fifty years apart, switching frequently between them. Each tells the story of a child's quest. In 1927, Rose (Simmonds) runs away from her father's New Jersey home to find her mother/idol, the actress Lillian Mayhew (Moore). In 1977, recently orphaned Ben (Fegley) runs away from his Minnesota home in search of his father.[3]"
The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"Steven Murphy, a skilled cardiothoracic surgeon, finishes an open heart surgery, and later goes to a diner where he meets a teenage boy named Martin. The precise nature of their relationship is unexplained. Afterward, Steven returns home to his wife, Anna, and their children, Kim and Bob. The next day, Steven reveals his connection to Martin, claiming he is a schoolmate of Kim's, when Martin unexpectedly comes to speak with Steven at the hospital. Steven later privately tells Anna that Martin's father died in a car accident ten years earlier, and that he has taken an interest in the boy to help him grieve. At Steven's suggestion, Martin comes to the Murphy household for dinner; Kim seems particularly taken with him.
Martin returns the favor by inviting Steven to his mother's home for dinner. After the meal, Steven attempts to leave, but Martin insists he stay and watch a movie with them. Martin leaves halfway through the film, and his mother makes a romantic advance on Steven, who quickly rebuffs her and goes home. Over the next few days, Martin's demands on Steven's time grow increasingly frequent and desperate, but Steven does not reply. One morning Bob awakens and finds he cannot feel his legs—he has become paralyzed. Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, where a full neurological examination reveals that nothing is physically wrong. Though he briefly recovers, Bob quickly returns to being unable to walk. While the elder Murphys tend to Bob, Kim meets with Martin for a date.
The next morning, Martin visits Bob in the hospital and demands that Steven speak to him in private. The two retreat to the cafeteria, where Martin reveals the truth: his father did not die immediately, as Steven told his wife, but during surgery that Steven himself performed after the crash. Steven failed to save Martin's father, and the boy bluntly tells Steven that he blames the surgeon for the death. He further explains that, to ""balance"" the act of destroying a family, Steven must kill one of the members of his own. Martin goes on to explain that he has placed a curse upon the Murphys that will gradually kill them through a series of stages unless Steven makes his choice and murders one of them; the paralysis is the first of these four stages. Steven attempts to dismiss these seemingly wild claims, but later finds that Bob is refusing food—this is the second stage of Martin's curse. Kim later loses the use of her legs during a choir practice and also will not eat.
Kim receives a phone call from Martin at the hospital. During the conversation, Kim abruptly regains the use of her legs, only to lose mobility again when the connection is broken. This seems to convince Anna of Martin's power, and she travels to his home to directly ask why she and her children must suffer for Steven's mistakes. The unrepentant Martin cannot answer, simply remarking that ""it's the only thing I can think of that's close to justice"". Anna, further suspecting that her formerly alcoholic husband may have imbibed on the day of the operation, speaks to Steven's anesthesiologist, who reveals that Steven did in fact have a few drinks that morning, with Anna sexually gratifying him as payment for the information. At Anna's insistence, the children are transported to their home, where they are continually fed through a nasogastric tube. Anna and Steven fight over the situation, with Steven refusing to believe that anything supernatural is happening. That night, he kidnaps Martin and binds him to a chair in the basement, brutally beating him and demanding that he undo his hold on the children. Martin remains unflappable, warning Steven that time is running out.
Martin's presence only exacerbates the tension in the household: Kim and Bob argue with each other over who their father will choose; Steven tries to gather information to make the decision; and Anna claims that killing one of the children is clearly the only option, as they can have another. Kim attempts to save herself by traveling to the basement to see Martin, demanding that he free her again so that they may run away together. Her strategy fails and she tries to escape herself by crawling through the neighborhood. Steven and Anna save her. The next morning, Anna releases Martin while Steven sleeps, pointing out that holding him captive was of no use. Later that day, Bob begins bleeding from the eyes—the final stage of the curse before death. Rather than choose, Steven binds Kim, Bob, and Anna to chairs in the living room, covers their heads, and pulls a black woolen hat over his own face. He next loads a rifle, spins uncontrollably, and fires. The first two shots miss, but the third pierces Bob's throat and kills him.
Some time later, the family visits the same diner where Steven previously met with Martin. As they sit in silence, Martin enters and stares at them; he and the family briefly lock eyes and Kim begins eating before they stand and leave. Martin gazes after them as they walk through the door."
Thank You for Your Service,"After a harrowing 15-month combat experience in Iraq, the much-decorated Adam Schumann (Miles Teller) returns home to Kansas and a loving wife, Saskia (Haley Bennett). Adam and Saskia have two young children, a daughter and infant son born while Adam was still overseas. Adam suffers from PTSD as manifest by nightmares and frequent flashbacks for which his wife convinces him to seek help from an overburdened Department of Veterans Affairs. He also receives solace from two Iraq buddies living nearby, an American Samoan, Solo Aeiti (Beulah Koale), and Billy Waller (Joe Cole), who commits suicide in front of his fiancée (Erin Darke) after discovering she has taken all his money and their child and left him.
Adam's unresolved psychological issues revolve around his failure to safely rescue a fellow soldier from a building under fire, Michael Emory (Scott Haze), who was dropped on his head and rendered hemiplegic but later expresses gratitude to Adam for being alive, and survivor's guilt about letting Sergeant First Class James Doster (Brad Beyer) take Adam's place on patrol one day. When the Humvee with Doster filling in for Adam makes a wrong turn and hits an improvised explosive device, Solo assists the men in their escape to safety, but Doster is inadvertently left behind and dies in the conflagration. Doster's grieving widow, Amanda (Amy Schumer), who is best of friends with Saskia Schumann, finally gains closure as she learns the circumstances of her husband's death towards the end of the movie and absolves Adam and Solo of responsibility for it.
Meanwhile, Solo suffers from such severe PTSD and memory loss that he is unable to fulfill a fervent desire to reenlist for another tour in Iraq. He falls in with a group of drug dealers led by a Gulf War veteran, Dante (Omar Dorsey). Adam rescues his friend and puts him on a Greyhound bus to California, where Solo will take Adam's place at a rehabilitation center specializing in the treatment of PTSD.
Sometime later, Adam returns from his own stay at the rehabilitation center, being greeted by his wife and children back in their original home."
Suburbicon,"In 1959, the peaceful, all-white neighborhood of Suburbicon is shaken up by the arrival of an African-American family, the Mayers.
Gardner Lodge, a mild-mannered man, is the father of a family in Suburbicon. One night, the home of the Lodge family is broken into by two robbers. The robbers tie the entire family up and kill the matriarch, Rose, with an overdose of chloroform. Her twin sister, Margaret, moves in to help take care of Nicky, the child of the family. Soon after her arrival, she begins to transform herself into Rose, dyeing her hair and having sex with Gardner.
As tensions mount between the residents of Suburbicon and their new African-American neighbors, charismatic insurance agent Bud Cooper arrives one day when Gardner is not home and begins asking Margaret questions, looking to clear up red flags in a life insurance claim made on Rose by Gardner shortly after her death. The conversation starts out innocuously enough, but Cooper grows suspicious when Margaret refers to herself and Gardner as a couple, after which Margaret kicks him out of the house.
Meanwhile, the two robbers who killed Rose are angry at Gardner after Nicky sneaks into the viewing room for a police lineup, where Gardner and Margaret denied that the two robbers were the ones who broke into their home. They are also mad that Gardner has not paid them a sum of money they were promised for killing Rose, and grow impatient when they are unable to reach him by phone. They make a plan to return to Gardner's house and kill Nicky and Margaret.
That night, as a prolonged protest at the home of the new African-American residents turns into a small-scale riot, Cooper returns to talk directly to Gardner. He tells Gardner that he knows the nature of his and Margaret's insurance fraud plan and attempts to blackmail them into giving him their entire payout in exchange for his silence. Margaret poisons his coffee with lye, and Gardner stabs him with a fireplace poker to finish him off. Gardner leaves to hide his body, trailed by one of the two robbers.
Margaret attempts to poison Nicky with a sandwich after he eavesdropped on her conversation with Cooper and contacted his Uncle Mitch for help. The increasingly suspicious Nicky does not eat the sandwich, and as Margaret is admitting defeat, one of the robbers strangles her to death before heading upstairs to deal with Nicky, who is saved by the arrival of Mitch. Mitch gives Nicky a gun and hides him in the closet before succumbing to a stab wound given to him by the now-dead robber.
On the way home from disposing of Cooper's body, Gardner is taunted by the other robber, who is suddenly killed by a fire truck. Arriving home, he finds the bodies of Margaret, Mitch, and the robber, and gets Nicky out of the closet. He offers Nicky a choice: go along with his plan to cash out an insurance claim and use the money to run away to Aruba, or be killed by Gardner.
The next morning, Gardner is dead, having eaten Margaret's poisoned sandwich during his conversation with Nicky. Nicky calmly goes outside to play ball with Andy, the son in the African-American family, as they are cleaning up the remnants of the previous night's riot."
Jigsaw,"Criminal Edgar Munsen is pursued by the police onto a rooftop, where he activates a triggering mechanism before being shot non-fatally by Detective Halloran and his fellow officers. Five people, Mitch, Anna, Ryan, Carly, and an unconscious man are held captive in a barn, each with a metal noose around their neck. A tape recording from John Kramer explains they must give a sacrifice of blood and will need to confess their sins. The chains begin pulling them towards a wall of buzzsaws. Most of the group survives by cutting themselves on the blades as an offering of blood, but the unconscious man awakens and is seemingly killed.
The next test divulges that Carly caused the death of an asthmatic woman by stealing her purse, which had her emergency inhaler inside. To save the others from being hanged, she must inject herself with one of the three needles- one containing an antidote to a poison in her system, one a saline solution, and one a potent acid. Ryan eventually stabs Carly with all three to save himself, melting her face and killing her.
Halloran and Detective Hunt begin investigating the discovery of bodies that appear to belong to the unnamed man and Carly. Halloran becomes suspicious of forensic pathologists Logan Nelson, a war veteran and former doctor whose wife was killed two years prior, and Eleanor Bonneville. Munsen is kidnapped from the hospital by an unseen assailant. When the police commissioner orders Kramer's grave be exhumed, Munsen is found inside with his throat slit.
Ryan tries escaping through a door marked ""No Exit"", and is trapped by wires that ensnare his leg. Anna and Mitch discover an unlocked door, and are trapped inside a grain silo. A taped message explains they will be buried in grain and killed by falling debris unless Ryan pulls a lever that will free him from the wires around his leg. Anna and Mitch survive, but Ryan's leg is severed when he pulls the lever. Logan and Eleanor speak about their mutual distrust of Halloran. Eleanor takes Logan to her ""studio"" where she reveals that she is an obsessive fangirl of the Jigsaw case, and has built replicas of Kramer's traps. She's worried her obsession might incriminate her. Detective Hunt has followed them, and informs Halloran of the studio.
The next test reveals Mitch knowingly sold a motorcycle with a faulty brake to Kramer's nephew, resulting in his death. Mitch will be lowered into a spiral-shaped blade unless he can reach for a brake lever. Though fellow group-member Anna attempts to help him, he is shredded by the blade and killed. Halloran calls for Eleanor and Logan's arrest after a corpse appearing to belong to Mitch is discovered in the studio. Logan convinces Hunt to let them go, as both suspect Halloran to be responsible. Eleanor has deduced the game's location, and she and Logan depart for the barn. Halloran pursues them. Meanwhile, Hunt finds puzzle-piece shaped pieces of human flesh in Halloran's freezer, fitting Jigsaw's M.O. and implicating Halloran as a copycat killer.
Anna attempts to slip through a doorway to freedom, only to be captured. She finds herself and Ryan chained in a room with a hooded figure, who is revealed to be a still-living John Kramer. Kramer reveals that Anna suffocated her infant in a fit of rage and blamed it on her sleeping husband by planting the body next to him. Her husband later committed suicide, thinking he accidentally smothered his own baby. It is also revealed that Ryan accidentally caused the death of several of his friends years prior in a car accident but managed to escape blame. Kramer tells them they have gotten his message ""backwards"". He places a loaded shotgun between them and tells them it is the ""key"" to their survival. Anna attempts to shoot Ryan, but the gun, which is revealed to be rigged, backfires and instead kills her. Ryan realizes that the keys to his and Anna's chains were in the gun, and destroyed when Anna pulled the trigger, leaving no hope of escape.
Logan and Eleanor investigate the barn, but are ambushed by Halloran. Eleanor escapes, and Halloran is drugged by an unseen assailant. Logan and Halloran awaken in collars rigged with laser cutters. They are told they must confess their sins to survive and may choose who goes first. Halloran forces Logan to go first. Logan confesses that he mislabeled Kramer's X-Rays years prior, which caused his cancer to go undiagnosed until it was too late. Despite confessing, Logan appears to die. Halloran is tested next. He admits to having allowed criminals to walk free for personal gain, and his collar deactivates.
Logan reveals he had faked his death and that the barn game in fact took place ten years ago. He was the man who appeared to die in the first game, but Kramer, feeling he should not die because of an honest mistake, saved him and recruited him. The bodies that were found were actually the bodies of criminals Halloran allowed to walk free that Logan placed in similar tests to the test that he had faced. Logan also reveals that Munsen, one of the criminals Halloran let go, was responsible for murdering his wife. However, because Halloran broke the rules to force Logan to go first, he will die and be framed as the Jigsaw copycat. Logan reactivates the laser collar around Halloran's neck which slices his head apart, killing him. Logan then declares he speaks for the dead."
Novitiate,"This is a story of the effect of Vatican II (1962-65) on the Church, as seen in one convent, through the eyes of the tough old-fashioned Mother Superior, the kinder, younger, and more modern nuns, and the Postulants and Novitiates, particularly Sister Cathleen.
Cathleen Harris was born in Tennessee in the 1950s. Her mother, Nora, a factory worker, is non-religious but wanted to show Cathleen a church and let her make her own decision. Cathleen's father, Chuck, comes home late, drunk, and argues with his wife. Finally, Chuck leaves home, Nora supports herself, and picks up a series of men for one-night stands.
Cathleen says she is looking for love, and finds it in the Catholic church. The Catholic school offers her a full scholarship, where a young nun befriends her and describes how she is married to Christ. After running into another one of her mother's pickups, Cathleen decides to give her life to God.
With 20 other girls, Cathleen joins the Sisters of the Beloved Rose. She will be a postulant for 6 months, after which she will become a novitiate for a year and a half, and then take her final vows.
The Abbess, Reverend Mother Marie Saint-Clair, is a ""tough, old style"" Mother Superior, who trains and disciplines the postulants. She leads the postulants through a meeting called the ""Chapter of Faults,"" in which they must publicly confess to all their faults, including the accusations of the other postulants, for which Mother Superior assigns extreme, humiliating penances, including ""The Discipline,"" a knotted whip that they use to flagellate themselves. She makes arbitrary judgments, reduces the postulants to tears, and sends them home from the convent for trivial infractions.
Sister Mary Grace, a young, warm, kind, and progressive nun, is the Postulant Mistress, who tries to make life easier for them. Most of the day is serious and disciplined, but sometimes the postulants fall into girlish activities and giggling.
Mother Superior keeps getting envelopes from Archbishop McCarthy about Vatican II, which she ignores. Sister Mary Grace sees the documents, and says that change would be good. Mother superior cuts her off with, ""The Church is perfect exactly the way it is."" Later, they argue, and Sister Mary Grace challenges Mother Superior's authority. Sister Mary Grace goes off to pray, and decides to leave the convent.
Finally Archbishop McCarthy pays a visit. He tells Mother Superior that ""this order in particular"" is having difficulty embracing the changes of Vatican II. She dismisses the ""ridiculous reforms."" He tells her that if she can't adopt to the changes, she will be replaced. As for ""that old medieval stuff,"" the extreme penances, ""That's gotta stop.""
Mother Superior is devastated. Her world has changed. She fears God has abandoned her. At the Chapter of Faults, a novice confesses that she questions whether God is real. Mother Superior tells her she's tired of hearing her spiritual wretchedness and assigns her to no penance at all.
Eventually, Mother Superior calls the congregation and reads aloud the Archbishop's memo about Vatican II. Priests will read the Mass in English, and face the congregation. Catholics must embrace religious tolerance. Nuns are no longer required to wear habits, but can wear whatever they want – and their status is now reduced and equal to any Catholic. Extreme punishments and suffering are forbidden. They are not an act of love, or desired by God.
Of the original 20 postulants, only 5 are left to profess their final vows. The priest asks one of the noviates the ritual question, ""What do you seek."" She answers that she wants to take her vows and marry Jesus Christ.
He asks Cathleen. She answers, ""I seek something more.""[3][4][1]"
All I See Is You,"The plot tells the story of a blind woman Gina (portrayed by Blake Lively) and her husband James (Jason Clarke). When her sight returns after a corneal implant, she begins to discover the previously unseen and disturbing details about themselves, their marriage and their lives.[4][5][6][7]
Gina and James have a happy marriage, despite Gina's dependence on James due to her disability. James appears to enjoy the dependence, saying that it makes him feel needed. As they try for a baby, Gina prepares for an eye transplant, which will restore the sight in one of her eyes. The surgery is a success, and Gina embraces her newfound independence. Immediately, her sex life with James suffers. To put the spark back in their marriage, James books them a holiday to Barcelona, promising Gina that he has reserved the same hotel room they had on their honeymoon. Upon their arrival, Gina claims the room is not the same, which James denies. Gina is later proven to be correct.
After Barcelona, they attempt to have sex on a sleeper train. James, blindfolded, demands to know who Gina fantasises about when she masturbates, seemingly doubtful when she answers that she only thinks of him. James later rewatches a video of the encounter, obsessed with his helplessness and Gina's emotionless face.
Still in Spain, Gina and James arrive at Gina's sister's house. One night, Gina visits a peep show with her sister and brother-in-law but becomes agitated when someone gropes her on the street. James declines their invitation to join and appears uncomfortable when Gina's brother-in-law jokingly suggests that Gina may find someone better-looking.
Back home in Thailand, Gina begins to have trouble with her vision. As her eyesight worsens, it is heavily implied that James is diluting her eye drops with water, thus damaging the transplant. Confused and terrified by her returning blindness, Gina brings her eye drops to her doctor, who promises to test them for contamination. James learns that he is sterile but does not tell Gina.
While James purchases a new house at Gina's insistence, Gina engages in a flirtation with Daniel, an attractive man she has met at the public pool. When her dog overheats during a walk, Daniel offers to take them back to his home for water. There, he and Gina have sex. Gina later reveals to James that she is pregnant, unintentionally confirming her affair as she is unaware of James's infertility. James does not confront her. Similarly, when Gina learns from her doctor that her eye drops have been tampered with, she does not confront James. Their home is broken into and their dog is stolen.
Some time later, a visibly pregnant Gina has apparently regressed into her former blind self. She and James move into their new house. At one point, James tests Gina's blindness, intentionally hiding from her in plain sight. He makes plans to meet her at a local school for a talent show in which she is performing. While he is gone, Gina receives an anonymous letter, written in crayon, that reveals James was the one who staged the home invasion and released their dog. The writer claims to have rescued the dog but refuses to return it because ""when I look into her eyes, she looks back at me, and that is what love is.""
James goes to their old apartment to collect the last of his and Gina's belongings. In the bathroom, he uncovers a stash of empty eye drop bottles. He realises that Gina discovered his deception and secretly continued to obtain eye drops from the doctor, meaning that she has been faking her blindness. Gina confirms this when she looks directly at him during the talent show. Distraught, James drives home in tears, impairing his vision and causing him to crash into an oncoming truck.
Home alone, Gina gives birth. She looks into her baby's eyes."
Amityville: The Awakening,"Teenager Belle Walker moves to 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, Long Island with her mother Joan, little sister Juliet, and brain-dead twin brother, James. The family's impetus for moving there was to be closer to Dr. Milton, a neurologist hoping to treat James, who suffered an accident that has left him on life support. Upon moving in, Juliet tells Belle that James has been talking to her lately, ""using a lot of curse words."" One night, James flatlines, but is mysteriously revived and opens his eyes.
At school, Belle is taunted by her peers over moving into the home, which she learns was the site of a mass murder by Ronald DeFeo Jr. in 1974. In her bedroom on the third floor, she discovers blood stains from the murder concealed under the wallpaper. One night, Belle invites acquaintances Terrence—an enthusiast on the Amityville haunting—and Marissa, over to watch The Amityville Horror (1979) at the house. At 3:15am in the middle of the film, the power goes out, and the three go into the basement to locate the fuse box, where they are confronted by Joan, who thinks they are intruders.
Dr. Milton, who suspects James may have locked-in syndrome, performs tests on James that show increased function; during the test, he witnesses an apparition of flies filling the room and attacking him, and leaves the house, shaken. James quickly gains the ability to communicate with the family via an AAC computer system that allows him to type by looking at the letters on a screen. Terrence suggests to Belle that James's sudden revival may be a result of possession stemming from the house; he and Belle suspect that a ring on the ground surrounding the house may represent a magic circle.
Belle asks James if someone else is inhabiting his body, and he replies ""yes"" and ""help"" via the computer. He asks her to kill him, and she begins to unplug the machine, but he suddenly attacks her. Joan enters the room, and finds that James is now breathing on his own. After finding the red room in the basement, which she believes to be the source of the power, Belle confronts her mother with the theory that the house is possessing James. Joan reveals to her that, having lost her faith in God after the death of her husband and James's subsequent accident, she moved the family to the home hoping to harness the demonic energy there in order to bring James back to life.
That night, as Belle prepares to leave, Joan knocks her unconscious. Belle awakens at 3:15am, just as her aunt Candice arrives at the house. James rises from his bed, and harnesses energy from the red room, which revitalizes his body. Belle makes her way downstairs as Candice enters the house, but James shoots Candice with a shotgun. Belle retrieves Juliet from her room, but is unable to open the front door. Joan is confronted by James in her bedroom; knowing she is facing death, she retrieves her crucifix, and holds it toward James, but he is unaffected; he reminds her that with the loss of her faith in God, He is not able to save her. He shoots Joan in the chest before throwing her on her bed and shooting her in the head. James is able to lure Juliet to the third floor, where he attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Belle, who tackles him, resulting in them both falling from the window. She drags James outside the circle, after which his body withers, and he dies just after telling her ""thank you.""
A newsreel epilogue reveals that Belle is being questioned in the murders of her mother, aunt, and brother, but that her sister, Juliet, corroborates her story, and that James's fingerprints were discovered on the murder weapon. Another news report comments on yet another tragedy occurring in the Amityville house."
Thor: Ragnarok,"Two years after the battle of Sokovia,[N 1] Thor has been unsuccessfully searching for the Infinity Stones, and is now imprisoned by the fire demon Surtur in Muspelheim. Surtur reveals that Thor's father Odin is no longer on Asgard, and that the realm will soon be destroyed in the prophesied Ragnarök, once Surtur unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. Thor defeats Surtur and claims his crown, believing he has prevented Ragnarök.
Thor returns to Asgard to find his brother Loki posing as Odin. Thor forces Loki to help him find their father, and with directions from Stephen Strange on Earth, they locate Odin in Norway. Odin explains that he is dying, and that his passing will allow his firstborn child, Hela, to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. Hela had been the leader of Asgard's armies, and had conquered the Nine Realms with Odin, but she had been imprisoned and written out of history after Odin feared that she had become too ambitious. Odin subsequently dies, and Hela, released from her imprisonment, appears. She destroys Thor's hammer Mjolnir, and when Thor and Loki attempt to flee through the Bifröst Bridge, she pursues them and forces them out into space to die. Hela arrives in Asgard, destroying its army and killing the Warriors Three. She then resurrects the ancient dead who once fought with her, including her giant wolf Fenris and appoints the Asgardian Skurge as her executioner. Hela plans to use the Bifröst to expand Asgard's empire, but Heimdall covertly steals the sword that controls the Bridge, and hides away with the rest of Asgard's citizens.
Thor crash-lands on Sakaar, a garbage planet surrounded by wormholes. A slave trader designated Scrapper 142 subdues him with an obedience disk and sells him as a gladiator to Sakaar's ruler, the Grandmaster, with whom Loki has already become ingratiated. Thor recognizes 142 as one of the Valkyrior, a legendary force of female warriors who were killed defending Asgard from Hela long ago. Thor is forced to compete in the Grandmaster's Contest of Champions, facing his old friend Hulk. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk and 142 to help him save Asgard, but neither is willing. He soon manages to escape the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of Natasha Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia.
The Grandmaster orders 142 and Loki to find Thor and Hulk, but the pair come to blows and Loki forces her to relive the deaths of her fellow Valkyrior at the hands of Hela. Deciding to help Thor, she takes Loki captive to prove her goodwill. Unwilling to be left behind, Loki provides the group with the means to steal one of the Grandmaster's ships. They then liberate the other gladiators who, led by Korg and Miek, stage a revolution. Loki attempts to again betray his brother to gain a reward from the Grandmaster, but Thor anticipates this and leaves him behind, where Korg and the gladiators soon find him. Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces are attacking Heimdall and Asgard's citizens for the sword that controls the Bifröst. Banner becomes Hulk again, defeating Fenris, while Thor and 142 battle Skurge and the resurrected warriors. Loki and the gladiators arrive to help, and the citizens board their ship; a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to allow their escape. Thor, facing Hela, loses his right eye and then has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnarök can stop her. While Hela is distracted, Loki locates Surtur's crown and places it in the Eternal Flame. Surtur is reborn and destroys Asgard, seemingly killing Hela.
Thor and the others escape with Asgard's remaining citizens aboard the Grandmaster's vessel. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth. In a mid-credits scene, they are intercepted by a large spacecraft.[N 2] In a post-credits scene, the Grandmaster encounters a group of his former subjects, who are still rebelling."
A Bad Moms Christmas,"Amy (Mila Kunis) is now in a happy relationship with Jesse (Jay Hernandez) and is looking forward to having a simple Christmas. Her plans are derailed when her overly critical mother, Ruth (Christine Baranski), texts her to say she is coming for Christmas.
Meanwhile, Kiki (Kristen Bell) is still overworked with her four kids but now her husband Kent is much more helpful. Kiki is surprised when her mother Sandy (Cheryl Hines) shows up three days earlier than expected and is planning to spend the next three weeks with Kiki. Sandy’s love for Kiki is overwhelming, and smothering Kiki.
When Carla (Kathryn Hahn) gets home, her mother, Isis (Susan Sarandon), has arrived, telling her she intends to spend time with her for the first time in years. Surprised by this turn of events Carla is excited to spend time with her. Eventually, Amy, Kiki and Carla go to the mall where they express their misery over the holidays. But while commiserating about the pressures of the holidays they make a pact to “take Christmas back”. Ruth tries to create a spectacle out of Christmas, rather than keeping it simple like Amy wanted. In an effort to tamp down those plans Amy takes the family to Sky Zone to meet up with Kiki and Carla and their families. Ruth, Sandy and Isis all meet and chat while their daughters have fun with their kids.
At work, Carla meets an erotic dancer named Ty (Justin Hartley), who says he is competing in a Sexy Santa competition and he asks Carla to be his date, which she enthusiastically accepts. Kiki continues to have issues with her mother’s overbearing ways and decides to bring Sandy to Dr. Karl (Wanda Sykes) to discuss these issues. This leads to a breakdown in communication leading to Kiki scolding Sandy and causing her to leave the session.
Amy and Kiki join Carla as they attend the Sexy Santa show. All the ladies in the room are impressed with Ty's dancing. To everyone's surprise, Isis gets up on the bar and starts dancing with Ty. Carla runs up to get Ty back, leading to a fight. When Carla brings Isis home, Isis tells her she needs money for a new investment, but Carla knows she's just going to gamble it all away and then disappear from Carla's life like it's been for years. Nonetheless, Carla relents and loans Isis the money.
On Christmas Eve, Sandy tells Kiki that she put up a cash offer for the house next door so that she can live right next to Kiki. Finally, Kiki lashes out and tells Sandy she cannot live next door and that she wants some space. Sandy leaves the room crying.
Amy gets angry with Ruth when she discovers Ruth has invited a bunch of strangers over to her home to throw an elaborate Christmas party, exactly what Amy did not want. Amy loses her temper and demands everyone leave her home and tells Ruth to leave and get out of her life forever. Her kids, Jane and Dylan, witness this outburst and become upset with Amy. Meanwhile, Carla finds a note from Isis indicating she has just taken off with the money she lent her. Kiki is all alone as well.
Ruth goes to church for Midnight Mass and is, surprisingly, joined by Sandy and Isis. All the ladies criticize each other for their efforts as mothers, with each of them realizing their flaws. Amy’s father goes to her to talk about Ruth and the horrible fight they had, but acknowledging that while Ruth can be difficult to deal with, she has always been insecure over her work as a mom toward Amy, always worried whether or not she was doing a good job as a mother, but she always had the right intentions and loved Amy unconditionally. Amy goes to the church to try and repair her relationship with her mother. They apologize to each other and express their love. Once the clock strikes midnight, Amy and Ruth rush home to fix Christmas.
On Christmas morning, Jane and Dylan go downstairs to see that Ruth has returned, the relationship has been repaired and the house looking wonderful with decorations and gifts. Kiki makes up with Sandy, who tells her she put the neighboring house on the market and admits that she's just always felt lonely on Christmas since Kiki's father died. Carla is then visited by Isis, who is serious about turning her life around and has a new job at Sky Zone.
All the families get together and Ruth, Sandy and Isis announce that they have become friends and are now planning to take a trip to Las Vegas."
Last Flag Flying,"In 2003, Larry ""Doc"" Shepherd (Carell) visits the bar of Sal Nealon (Cranston), a former Marine that he served with in Vietnam. Sal willingly joins Doc on an impromptu drive where Doc reveals that he's also tracked down another friend from Vietnam, now-Reverend Richard Mueller. Sal and Doc are invited to dinner with the Muellers, where Doc reveals he is recently widowed and just lost his only son in Iraq. He admits he tracked down Sal and Mueller in the hope that they would accompany him to collect his son Larry Jr's body and take him to his scheduled burial. Sal agrees, though Mueller is hesitant, claiming that Sal and Doc represent a dark period in his life. His wife urges him to do it, so he reluctantly agrees to accompany him.
Along the way, Sal and Mueller clash over their differing philosophies and their mutual guilt over their past; both Sal and Mueller (nicknamed the Mauler) indulged in alcohol, drugs and prostitutes while on deployment, and on one occasion used up the entire supply of then-19 year old Doc's painkillers, which led to a needlessly painful death for one of their fellow Marines and a dishonorable discharge for Doc. Sal, who has no social filter from a head injury from the war, continually gets under Mueller's skin for having found religion, whilst Mueller expresses frustration at Sal's lack of maturity. At Dover Air Force Base, Doc requests to view the maimed body of his son, against the advice of Mueller and LtCol Willits (Vazquez). During the viewing, LCpl Charlie Washington, Larry's close friend, reveals to Sal and Mueller that Larry Jr had been killed while shopping at an Iraqi market, contrary to the official story of dying while fighting heroically; Sal reveals the truth to a disillusioned Doc, who refuses the Arlington National Cemetery burial and insists on giving Larry Jr a civilian burial. Willits orders Washington to accompany the body and coerce Doc into changing his mind about having his deceased son buried in civilian clothing.
Sal, Mueller and Doc begin a long road trip back home, waylaid by the Department of Homeland Security (alerted by their cash rental, vague destination and Mueller's praying) and a missed train in New York. Over the course of the journey, the clashing becomes more good natured and Doc begins to boost in the company of his friends. Sal asks Doc to move to his town to run the bar with him, and the three purchase their first cell phones to stay in contact. Their trip takes them to Boston where Sal insists that they meet the mother of Jimmy Hightower, the fellow Marine who died painfully without morphine. When they arrive, they realise that Mrs. Hightower was given the same story about her son's heroism that Doc was given about Larry Jr; Sal decides not to deny her the story and the trio pretend to have been the men that Hightower saved when he was killed in action.
The group return to Portsmouth for Larry Jr's funeral, and where Washington persuades Doc that Larry's civilian suit will be too small and he should be buried in his dress blues. At the burial, Sal and Mueller wear their uniforms, and participate in the flag-folding ceremony. Back at Doc's house, Charlie gives Doc a letter from Larry, claiming not to have read it. Doc reads Larry's wishes; to be buried beside his mother wearing his uniform. Doc smiles as Larry thanks him for being a great father."
Lady Bird,"Christine ""Lady Bird"" McPherson is a senior student at a Catholic high school in Sacramento in 2002. She longs to attend an Ivy League college in ""a city with culture"". Her family is struggling financially, and her mother tells her that Lady Bird is ungrateful for what she has.
Lady Bird and her best friend Julie join their school theater program, where Lady Bird meets Danny O'Neill. She and Danny develop a romantic relationship, and, to her mother's disappointment, Lady Bird joins Danny's wealthy family for Thanksgiving dinner. Their relationship ends when Lady Bird discovers Danny kissing a boy in a bathroom stall.
At the behest of her mother, Lady Bird takes a job at a coffee shop, where she meets Kyle, a young musician she recognizes from a show the previous semester. They begin dating. One of the popular girls at the school, Jenna, is reprimanded by Sister Sarah, a teacher, for wearing a short skirt, and Lady Bird suggests that she and Jenna bond by vandalizing the nun's car. As Lady Bird grows closer to Kyle and Jenna, she gradually deserts Julie.
Lady Bird drops out of the theater program. At the coffee shop, she consoles Danny after he expresses his struggle in coming out, and they become friends again. After Kyle tells Lady Bird he is a virgin, she loses her virginity to him, but he later denies having said it. This leaves her unfulfilled, and contributes to their breakup.
Jenna surprises Lady Bird by looking for her at Danny's grandmother's house, which, to appear wealthy, Lady Bird had told her was her house. Lady Bird admits to the lie, and Jenna agrees to forgive her because of Kyle, but makes it clear that they are no longer friends. Lady Bird discovers that her father has lost his job and that he has been battling depression for most of his life.
Lady Bird begins applying to East Coast colleges despite her mother's insistence that the family cannot afford it. She is accepted into UC Davis, but is upset because she feels it is too close to home. Soon thereafter, she is elated to discover that she has been placed on the wait list for a New York college, but, fearing her response, does not share the news with her mother. Lady Bird sets out for her high school prom with Kyle, Jenna, and Jenna’s boyfriend, but the four decide to go to a house party instead. Lady Bird changes her mind during the car ride and asks them to drop her off at Julie's apartment, where the two rekindle their friendship and go to prom together.
After Lady Bird's graduation, Danny accidentally reveals to Lady Bird's mother that she has been wait-listed, and her mother stops talking to her for the rest of the summer. On her 18th birthday, Lady Bird's father shares a cupcake with her. To celebrate reaching legal adulthood, Lady Bird buys a pack of cigarettes, a scratch-off ticket, and an issue of Playgirl magazine. She passes her driving test, and redecorates her bedroom. Lady Bird learns she has been accepted by the New York college, and can afford the tuition with financial aid and her father's help. Her parents take her to the airport, but her mother refuses to go inside to say goodbye. She quickly has a change of heart and drives back, only to discover Lady Bird's flight has already left.
In New York, Lady Bird finds thoughtful letters written by her mother and salvaged by her father, and begins using her birth name again. She is hospitalized after drinking heavily at a party. After leaving the hospital, she attends a Catholic mass, then calls home and leaves an apologetic voicemail message for her mother."
Murder on the Orient Express,"In 1934, famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot solves a theft at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The obsessive-compulsive—who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth to be a curse — wants to rest in Istanbul, but must return to London for another case. His friend Bouc, director of the Simplon Orient Express, offers him a room aboard the train.
Unscrupulous businessman Edward Ratchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threatening letters from an unknown party, but Poirot refuses. That night, Poirot hears strange noises coming from Ratchett's compartment, and later sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers.
The next morning, Poirot discovers Ratchett was murdered during the night after having been stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the other passengers as repairs begin. Evidence indicates that Ratchett was murdered by one person, and Caroline Hubbard, a fellow passenger, claims that a man had been in her compartment in the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. After the ransom was paid, Daisy was found murdered. Ratchett's true identity is revealed: he was John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and murderer. The shock of her death caused her mother Sonia to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, Colonel John Armstrong, then committed suicide. The family's nursemaid Susanne was wrongly suspected of complicity, leading to her being arrested and subsequent suicide in police custody, only to be found innocent afterward.
More evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief, and, in Mrs. Hubbard's compartment, the button of a conductor's uniform. The uniform is later found, as is the red kimono — in Poirot's own suitcase. Hubbard is suddenly stabbed in the back; she survives but cannot identify the culprit. Poirot discovers many of the passengers have direct connections to the Armstrong family and uncovers their hidden pasts. While interviewing governess Mary Debenham, Doctor John Arbuthnot shoots Poirot in the shoulder, claiming responsibility for the murder, but Bouc stops him from killing Poirot. Poirot realizes that Arbuthnot — a medical doctor and former army sniper — never meant to kill him.
Poirot confronts the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how Cassetti died. The first is simple but does not meet all of the facts: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train at a previous stop, murdered Cassetti, and fled at the stop as the train left. The second is more complex: with every single suspect connected to the Armstrongs, Susanne, or her trial in some way, they all had a motive against Cassetti. Poirot predicts that they acted together. Hubbard is revealed to be Linda Arden, a former stage actress and aspiring director, and Sonia Armstrong's mother.
Hubbard confirms the latter, admitting that she planned the murder and had recruited everyone else to help her. All the other passengers and the Conductor, Pierre Michel (Susanne's brother), took turns stabbing Cassetti. Mary wore the kimono, and Arbuthnot stabbed Hubbard without endangering her life, to convince Poirot of a lone killer. Poirot challenges the passengers and Michel to shoot him with a confiscated gun since he is the only one who can expose their plot; Bouc can lie, but Poirot, obsessed with truth and balance, cannot. Hubbard grabs the gun and tries to kill herself, but it is not loaded; Poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.
With the train back on track, Poirot concludes that justice is impossible in the case, as Cassetti deserved death; for the first time, Poirot will have to live with a lie and imbalance. He presents the lone killer theory to the Yugoslavian police, allowing the others to leave on the train. As he disembarks, a British Army messenger asks him to investigate a death on the Nile. Poirot accepts the case."
Daddy's Home 2,"After finally becoming friends at the end of the first film, Brad Whittaker and Dusty Mayron have a co-dad system where their two children, Megan and Dylan, take turns at each father's house. Dusty has also remarried, this time to Karen, a writer, and is stepdad to Adrianna, Karen's daughter.
Brad and his wife, Sara, along with Dusty and Karen, attend a school play for Megan, where she announces to the whole audience that she doesn't like the fact that she has to go back and forth to different houses all the time. Back at the house, after the play, Brad and Dusty decide to do away with having two separate Christmases and instead do one ""together Christmas"". Dusty, however, finds out his tough fighter pilot/astronaut father Kurt (Mel Gibson) is coming for Christmas.
At the airport the next day, Dusty tells Brad that his father is going to make fun of them since he won't understand their co-dad arrangement. When Kurt arrives, he mistakes Brad for a chauffeur. When Dusty explains that Brad is the stepdad to his children, Kurt doesn't like it. Brad's overbearing and over-cheerful dad, Don, arrives next, unnerving Kurt. Don tells Brad that his mother didn't come along, because she is taking care of Brad's Uncle who isn't feeling well.
Back at the house, Megan and Dylan warmly embrace Don, since he is very present in their lives, while Kurt hasn't seen the children since they were toddlers. Kurt rents a large cabin through Airbnb, to house all of them through the holiday week. As Brad and Dusty pack the bags into the car, Dusty tells Brad that Kurt thinks the two men are harboring bad feelings for each other, but are just hiding it from everyone by pretending to be friends. When Kurt comes up, they change the subject.
Throughout the week, Brad and Dusty's co-dad relationship is put to the test by Kurt's meddling. Meanwhile, Dusty tries to get close to his stepdaughter, Adrianna, but she doesn't like him and repeatedly tells him that he isn't her father. Sara also tries to bond with Karen but is taken aback by some of Karen's actions, like shoplifting clothes from a store. Dylan develops a crush on a little girl staying in the cabin next door. He gets made fun of it by Megan and Adrianna.
The next day, the family goes out to take the kids to see Santa. While there, Kurt convinces Dylan to ask Santa for a shotgun, which he does ask for. Brad and Sara tell Dylan that a shotgun for hunting means that a poor innocent animal will lose its life. This convinces Dylan to change his mind, but Megan instead decides she wants to go hunting. While out hunting the next day, Megan accidentally shoots Kurt in the shoulder, sending him to the hospital.
At the hospital, Dusty and Kurt begin to bond after they almost begin fighting when Kurt tries to leave the hospital. That night, Brad, Dusty, Don & Kurt go to an improv comedy club where the four men are relaxing and having a good time watching the show. Kurt gets up to go get another drink at the bar. Dusty sees Kurt picking up a woman at the bar and leaves with her. Brad enters Don into the improv show, and Dusty chooses a topic of a husband confronting his cheating wife as the subject of an improv skit. As the skit progresses, it is revealed that Don has separated from his wife in real life. The audience believes that this is all part of the show, even when Brad tries to tell the audience that it is not.
The next day, Brad confronts Dusty. After Dusty reveals that he chose the infidelity subject for the improv game because he wanted to get back at Brad, because of how Brad has a good relationship with Don. Brad says he knows that is why Dusty chose that particular topic and to get back at Dusty; Brad has invited Adrianna's real dad, Roger, to the cabin for Christmas.
That evening, the entire family takes part in a Christmas manger representation. Brad gets into a fight with Dusty after Brad wants to play Joseph, which Dusty is currently playing. This breaks out in front of a crowd that is watching. Instead of Dusty fighting Brad, he almost comes to blows with Roger.
The next morning, Christmas Day, the families all pack up to leave. On their way out of town, the families are forced back to town on account of a blizzard. They are forced to take shelter at a movie theater. With every other movie being sold out, due to the huge influx of business from other families seeking shelter at the theater, both families go to see the last movie available: Missile Tow, a fictitious Liam Neeson holiday action film.
When the power cuts off during the movie, the families go to the lobby where each man confronts their father about the secrets, lies, and attitudes. Don confronts Brad about not telling him the truth about his divorce, while Dusty tries to talk to Kurt. When Dylan sees the girl he has a crush on, is also there at the theater, he is teased again by Megan and Adrianna. After remembering some advice given to him by Kurt, Dylan walks toward her to kiss her. All of a sudden, he doesn't kiss her, but instead kisses Adrianna, his stepsister. Roger gets freaked out and attempts to leave with Adrianna, but is confronted by Dusty. He deduces that the reason why Adrianna hasn't warmed up to him is that he has never told her that he loves her, which he does. He also tells Roger that loving Adrianna means loving her real father as well since he is also part of the family. Roger almost leaves without Adrianna, but has a change of heart after everyone breaks out into a song of Do They Know It's Christmas? and decides to stay. Don and Brad also reconcile.
Sometime later, at the airport, Don and Kurt are preparing to leave to head back to their respective homes. Kurt heads with Don up the terminal escalators, where he reveals to Don that he switched out the tickets and they're going to spend New Years in Las Vegas.
As Brad's mom's flight arrives, Dusty and Brad discover that Brad's new stepdad is Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the pilot of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" flight. Brad and Dusty remember that they watched the film ""Sully"" together not too long ago and Brad appears to be welcoming towards him. Brad runs down the terminal and says that Sully will never replace his father, because Sully has only one great personal story, whereas his father has thousands of stories."
LBJ,"The story centers around the political upheaval that Vice President Johnson faced when he was thrust into the presidency at the hands of an assassin's bullet in November 1963. With political battles on both sides of the aisle, Johnson works to heal a nation and secure his presidency by passing Kennedy's historic Civil Rights Act."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","In the town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes is grieving the rape and murder of her teenage daughter, Angela, seven months earlier. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, Mildred rents three abandoned billboards near her home, and posts on them: ""Raped While Dying"", ""Still No Arrests?"", and ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?"" The billboards upset the townspeople, including Chief Bill Willoughby and Officer Jason Dixon, the latter being a racist and a violent alcoholic. The open secret that Willoughby suffers from terminal pancreatic cancer adds to everyone's disapproval. Mildred and her son Robbie are harassed and threatened, but to Robbie's chagrin, she stays firm about keeping the billboards up.
While Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration, he finds the billboards an unfair attack on his character. Angered by Mildred's lack of respect for his authority, Dixon threatens businessman Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, and he arrests her friend and coworker, Denise, on trivial marijuana possession charges. Mildred is also visited by her abusive ex-husband Charlie, who blames her for their daughter's death.
Willoughby brings Mildred in for questioning after she drills a hole in her dentist's thumb when he threatens her. During the interview, Willoughby coughs up blood. He leaves the hospital against medical advice and spends an idyllic day with his wife Anne and their two daughters, then commits suicide due to his illness. He leaves suicide notes for several people, including Mildred, in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide and that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up for another month, amused at the trouble this will bring her and hope that they will keep attention on the murder. Dixon reacts to the news of Willoughby's death by assaulting Welby and throwing him out of a window. This is witnessed by Willoughby's replacement, Abercrombie, who fires Dixon. In the meanwhile, Mildred is threatened by a crop-haired stranger in her store.
The billboards are destroyed by arson. Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes is unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is there to read Willoughby's letter to him, which advises him to let go of hate and learn to love, as the only way to realize his wish to become a detective. Dixon escapes with Angela's case file but suffers severe burns. Mildred's acquaintance James witnesses the incident and provides Mildred with an alibi, claiming they were on a date. Dixon is treated for his burns, and he is temporarily confined in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes.
Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who threatened Mildred bragging in a bar of an incident similar to Angela's murder. He notes the Idaho license plate number of the man's vehicle, then provokes a fight by scratching the man's face. At home later, he removes a sample of the man's DNA from under his fingernails. Meanwhile, Mildred goes on a date with James to thank him for the alibi. Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope and admits to burning the billboards while intoxicated. After accidentally causing James to leave, Mildred tells Charlie to treat Penelope well and leaves.
Though commending him, Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match DNA found on Angela's body, and that the man was overseas on military duty at the time of the murder. Dixon concludes that the man must be guilty of some other rape, and joins Mildred on a trip to Idaho in order to kill him. On the way, Mildred confesses to Dixon that she set the police station on fire. He indicates that he knew already. They express reservations about their mission but agree to decide what to do along the way."
Mayhem,"Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or ""Red Eye"" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a coworker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office.
One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called ""The Siren"", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug. They go up to their boss John Towers' office to plead their cases, but Cara wins the boss over and has Derek laid off. Derek's friend Ewan is unable to help him, and he is given official notice of his firing by his coworker ""The Reaper"". Derek takes his things and is escorted downstairs by company security, dejected and afraid of being disbarred.
When Derek reaches the ground floor, he and the security guards find that the building is under quarantine; the ID-7 virus has been detected in the ventilation system. CDC agents have released a neutralizing agent into the building, estimating that it will take eight hours for the virus to be obliterated. Derek, realizing he's infected by the virus and will not be liable for anything he does, attacks the security guards and storms into the elevator, intending to get upstairs and kill his boss; however, he's sent down to the basement and beaten up by Towers' enforcer, ""The Bull"". The Bull kills Ewan by mistake, infuriating Derek further.
Derek is thrown into an empty office with Melanie, who is also infected. After Derek manages to get a phone call out to Vandacorp and ensure his innocence in the mis-handled case, the two decide to work together, break out of the basement, and kill the people on the top floor responsible for their respective bad situations. They first go up to The Reaper and kill two security guards to get to him, witnessing general mayhem along the way. The Reaper gives them his key card, but attacks Melanie, who kills him with a power saw. Derek and Melanie use the key card to get up to The Siren's office and take down an army of coworkers defending her. The Siren asks her long-suffering assistant Meg to get the key card for her, but Meg has destroyed it in a microwave, having been offered a promotion from upstairs to betray The Siren. Her work done, Meg kills The Siren with a pair of scissors, and Derek and Melanie go down to IT to come up with another plan to get up to the top floor.
Derek and Melanie convince the company's one IT worker to hack their other boss Irene Smythe's computer to get her to come down; Smythe is the one who denied Melanie the extension on her loan. Smythe agrees to give Derek her key card in exchange for Melanie. Derek agrees and restrains Melanie, but undoes the bolts on the chair Melanie is fastened to, allowing her to kill Irene and escape. On the top floor, Towers offers Derek a full partnership if he gives up his revenge mission. Derek refuses and fights his boss; the company's board of directors give him permission to kill Towers, and Derek shoves him over a railing, sending him falling from the penthouse to the ground and his death just as the quarantine is lifted and the virus is eradicated.
Derek takes a higher position in the firm for just long enough to sign off on the extension on Melanie's loan, then quits the company and takes up painting with Melanie. He advises the audience to take control of their own lives before it's too late, accompanied by a shot of Towers' body hitting the ground with a splat."
Justice League,"Thousands of years ago, Steppenwolf and his legions of Parademons attempt to take over Earth with the combined energies of three Mother Boxes. They are foiled by a unified army that includes the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, mankind, and the Green Lantern Corps. After repelling Steppenwolf's army, the Mother Boxes are separated and hidden in locations on the planet. In the present, mankind is in mourning over Superman, whose death triggers the Mother Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth in an effort to regain favor with his master, Darkseid. Steppenwolf aims to gather the artifacts to form ""The Unity"", which will destroy Earth's ecology and terraform it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld.
Steppenwolf retrieves the Mother Box from Themyscira, prompting Queen Hippolyta to warn her daughter Diana of Steppenwolf's return. Diana joins Bruce Wayne in his attempt to unite other metahumans to their cause, with Wayne going after Arthur Curry and Barry Allen, while Diana tries to locate Victor Stone. Wayne fails to persuade Curry, but manages to recruit an enthusiastic Allen onto the team. Although Diana fails to convince Stone to join, he agrees to help them locate the threat if he discovers their location. Stone later joins the team after his father Silas, along with several other S.T.A.R. Labs employees, is kidnapped by Steppenwolf seeking to acquire the Mother Box from mankind.
Steppenwolf attacks Atlantis to retrieve the next Mother Box, forcing Curry into action. The team receives intel from Commissioner James Gordon leading them to Steppenwolf's army, based in an abandoned facility under Gotham Harbor. Although the group manages to rescue the kidnapped employees, the facility is flooded during combat, which traps the team until Curry helps delay the flood so they can escape. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had hidden, for the group to analyze. Stone reveals that his father used the Mother Box to rebuild Stone's body after an accident almost cost him his life. Facing overwhelming odds against Steppenwolf's army, Wayne decides to use the Mother Box to resurrect Superman, not only to help them fight off Steppenwolf's invasion, but also to restore hope to mankind. Diana and Curry are hesitant about the idea, but Wayne forms a secret contingency plan in case Superman returns as a nemesis.
Clark Kent's body is exhumed and placed in the amniotic fluid of the genesis chamber of the Kryptonian ship alongside the Mother Box, which in turn activates and successfully resurrects Superman. However, Superman's memories have not returned, and he attacks the group after Stone accidentally launches a projectile at him. On the verge of being killed by Superman, Batman enacts his contingency plan: Lois Lane. Superman calms down and leaves with Lane to his family home in Smallville, where he reflects and attempts to recover his memories. With the final Mother Box unguarded, Steppenwolf retrieves it with ease. Without Superman to aid them, the five heroes travel to a village in Russia where Steppenwolf aims to unite the Mother Boxes once again and remake Earth. The team fights their way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf, although they are unable to distract him enough for Stone to separate the Mother boxes. Superman arrives and assists Allen in evacuating the city, as well as Stone in separating the Mother Boxes. The team defeats Steppenwolf, who, overcome with fear, is attacked by his own Parademons before they all teleport away.
In the aftermath of the battle, Bruce and Diana agree to set up a base of operations for the team, with room for more members. Diana steps back into the public spotlight as a hero; Barry acquires a job in Central City's police department, impressing his father; Victor continues to explore and enhance his abilities with his father in S.T.A.R. Labs; Arthur returns to Atlantis; and Superman resumes his life as reporter Clark Kent. In a post-credits scene, Lex Luthor escapes from Arkham Asylum and recruits Slade Wilson to form their own league."
The Star,"In ""9 months B.C."", Mary is visited by an angel telling her she will bear the Messiah. A pygmy jerboa named Abby overhears and tells the other animals as a star begins glowing brightly in the night.
Six months later, a young donkey is tired of milling wheat and wishes to join a traveling caravan so that he may feel important. An older donkey helps him escape the miller who owns them and he ends up with an injured ankle at the house of Joseph and Mary who just celebrated their wedding. Mary takes the donkey in and names him Boaz, or Bo, and reveals to Joseph that she is pregnant, with Joseph accepting Mary's situation after praying to God. During this time, Bo and his dove friend Dave, plot to escape despite Mary's kindness, but end up staying three more months.
Meanwhile, the three wise men and their camels, Felix, Cyrus and Deborah, arrive at the home of King Herod. The wise men reveal their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, but when they reveal that it is for the ""new King"", he sends them on their way to meet him, but secretly sends his head soldier and his two dogs, Thaddeus and Rufus, to find and kill the new King.
As Joseph and Mary leave Nazareth in order to head to Bethlehem, Bo and Dave try another escape, but are confronted by Thaddeus and Rufus, who knew of the home by interrogating Abby. After learning that Joseph and Mary are not home, the soldier and his dogs leave to look for them. Feeling guilty, Bo decides to warn them with Dave joining him. Along the way they meet a friendly sheep named Ruth who left her flock when she saw the star. They catch up to Joseph and Mary in time to warn them, and hide them in a market place where the soldier ties up his dogs. Bo releases the cart Joseph and Mary were using to roll down and cause a chain reaction that knocks the soldier down a well. However, he creates severe damage to the market in the process, and Joseph, unaware of the danger, berates Bo for his actions.
Upset with being rejected, Bo leaves and Dave follows until they arrive at the caravan. While happy to have found it, Bo realizes that he liked being with Mary and tells Dave, who admits that he isn't upset and that he just wants Bo to be happy with his decision. Together, the two return and make up with Ruth, and then convince a frustrated Joseph to talk to Mary. Mary admits that it has been difficult for her and that she is scared of the importance of the baby, and Joseph and she make up when the latter begins having contractions. They arrive at Bethlehem where Joseph can't find an inn for Mary. The miller, who just so happened to be there, kidnaps Bo with Dave and Ruth leaving to rescue him. The wise men arrive as well, but the camels, who are aware of Herod's plot, are left tied to a post.
Bo ends up in a barn where he meets a horse named Leah, a cow named Edith, and a goat named Zach. They reveal that they haven't been able to sleep because the star's bright light has been shining through on their manger. Realizing that this is where the baby is supposed to be, the animals help Bo escape and he catches up with Dave and Ruth while spotting the soldier and his dogs. Bo finds Joseph and Mary and gets them back to the manger while Dave runs into Cyrus, Felix and Deborah and helps them escape. Ruth finds her flock (who had previously refused to follow her), and tries to convince them to help, but gets unexpected help from the angel who informs the shepherds and the sheep that the Savior is coming. Bo manages to fight off Thaddeus and Rufus, but is outdone by the soldier. Suddenly, Ruth and her flock, the camels and Dave arrive and dispatch with them by having them hang from a cliff. The soldier lets his dogs fall, but they are saved by Bo and the soldier himself falls to his death.
All of the animals (who are now joined by Abby, who assumed the danger to be ongoing), shepherds, and three wise men arrive to see baby Jesus, and Bo realises that he has been carrying the new King the whole time. Deborah predicts that this event will be remembered around the world for years to come.
During the credits, it is shown that Joseph buys Bo from the miller and Bo helps him and Mary raise Jesus."
Wonder,"August ""Auggie"" Pullman is a young boy raised in North River Heights in upper Manhattan, New York. He has a rare medical facial deformity, which he refers to as ""mandibulofacial dysostosis."" Due to numerous surgeries (27), Auggie had been home-schooled by his parents Isabel and Nate, but as Auggie is approaching middle school age, Isabel and Nate decide to send him to Beecher Prep, a mainstream private school. Fifth grade is tough for Auggie who is ostracized by nearly all the student body. He is bullied by being called a freak and rumors were spread that kids will get the ""plague"" if they touch him. He does befriend a boy named Jack Will.
Halloween is Auggie's favorite holiday. He has to wear an old ""Ghostface"" mask and costume because his dog, Daisy, threw up on his ""Boba Fett"" costume. He walks around school unrecognized and is not tormented while incognito. As he walks through the door to his homeroom, he overhears his friend Jack telling Julian Albans that he was ""only pretending to be friends with Auggie."" Feeling betrayed, Auggie leaves school and wants to stay home during trick-or-treating. His older sister Olivia, nicknamed ""Via,"" tells him she is still his friend and talks him out of it. Auggie later confides the incident to a new friend, named Summer, but swears her to secrecy. When Jack notices that Auggie has become quiet and distant he asks Summer why, but she only gives him the clue ""Ghost Face"". Jack is shocked when it dawns on him that it was Auggie wearing the Ghost Face costume, and thus had overheard everything he said to Julian. When Julian calls Auggie a ""freak,"" Jack angrily punches him in the face and a fight ensues between the two, which is soon broken up by their homeroom teacher Mr. Browne. Jack is suspended for two days for his actions. He apologizes to Auggie and the two friends reconcile. They even team up for a winning science project.
During the middle of the school year, Auggie is constantly bullied by Julian and his friends Amos, Miles, and Henry. They leave hurtful and threatening notes on his desk and tape their class picture on his locker with Auggie photoshopped out. Mr. Tushman confronts Julian and his parents. Julian's mother assures the principal that her boy is no bully. She even proclaims that she had Auggie edited out of the picture because she didn't want people to only care about Auggie and his family more than Julian. She also threatens to pull their funding from the school. Tushman shows all of his evidence and suspends Julian for two days, along with making him stay home from the annual nature retreat. As he and his parents leave, a remorseful Julian apologizes to Tushman for his behavior which the principal proudly accepts.
Via has her own teen problems as well as feeling left out with all of the parental attention given to her sick brother. Her best friend, Miranda, has been ignoring her all year but she meets a new boy Justin who encourages her to join Drama Club. Via and Justin develop a close friendship which later turns into a romantic relationship and her first kiss. Via is selected to be an understudy for the lead role in the school's production of ""Our Town,"" but Miranda gets the lead role. Miranda realizes the pain and harm she's done to Via, and on opening night pretends to fall ill. Via takes her place and gives a performance that earns her a standing ovation.
During the nature retreat, Auggie and Jack are harassed by a group of seventh graders from another school and Amos, Miles, and Henry come to their defense. After their return to school, Auggie is generally more accepted by his classmates, including the reformed Julian. At the school's year end graduation ceremony, Tushman announces that Auggie has been selected for the Henry Ward Beecher Medal for being a strong standing out student. Auggie receives a standing ovation. His mother Isabel calls Auggie her ""wonder"". The movie ends with a shot of a floating astronaut: Auggie's goal in life."
Mr. Roosevelt,"Emily Martin (Noël Wells) returns to her hometown and attempts to come to terms with her past, while staying with her ex-boyfriend (Nick Thune) and his new girlfriend (Britt Lower)."
"Roman J. Israel, Esq.","Roman J. Israel (Denzel Washington) is a lawyer and activist working for a small law firm in Los Angeles. In his two-partner office, Israel is responsible for preparing memos and briefs while William Jackson, the firm's owner and a well-respected professor, focuses on the courtroom appearances that Israel struggles with. Israel has spent years developing a brief that he believes will change the justice system, in the meantime sacrificing a family and a normal life to fight for justice. While Israel is short on interpersonal skills, he is gifted with a phenomenal memory as well as strong personal convictions on the meaning of justice.
Jackson suffers a heart attack and falls into a coma, forcing Israel to make several courtroom appearances in his stead which go poorly. Jackson's niece reveals to Israel that the firm is broke and that Jackson's succession plan leaves George Pierce (Colin Farrell) in charge. Pierce plans to shut the firm down but offers Israel a job at his own much larger firm. Israel rejects this offer out of hand believing that Pierce is simply a greedy, self-obsessed lawyer. While looking for a new job, Israel meets Maya (Carmen Ejogo) during a job interview at a local activist network. The job interview does not go well, but Maya offers him the opportunity to speak at an upcoming meeting she is organizing.
After failing to find employment elsewhere, Israel reluctantly takes a job with Pierce. Israel is a poor fit at the big firm, clashing with the number two partner Jesse Salinas after Israel mockingly laughs at a disparaging joke Salinas makes about battered women. After attempting to interest Pierce in the legal brief he has been preparing to attempt changing the legal system itself, Israel is disappointed when he is instead assigned by Pierce to several clients including Ellerbee, a young man arrested for murder. Ellerbee maintains he did not do it but is willing to testify against the shooter, wanted fugitive Carter Johnson. Israel goes behind Salinas' back to attempt to negotiate a plea deal for Ellerbee with the district attorney but insults her by insinuating her incompetence. No bargain is struck and Ellerbee is murdered before his case goes to trial.
Israel's mishandling of Ellerbee's case leads to trouble for the firm and causes Pierce to berate him for his insubordination. That evening Israel is mugged and beaten by a homeless man. He becomes downcast and starts adopting a new, cynical attitude. Israel contacts relatives of the murdered store clerk for a $100,000 reward for Johnson's location. Spending the money lavishly, Israel indulges in luxuries he had previously eschewed but still finds himself feeling numb. Jackson dies after his extended coma, but Israel is unmoved and refuses to speak at his memorial service, believing that his mentor was truly flawed in thinking the world could be a just place.
Pierce, inspired after hearing positive testimonials from Israel's other clients about his personal touch and honest approach, resolves to reform his firm including a new focus on pro-bono cases. While he is now celebrated at work, Israel's new materialistic outlook prevents him from enjoying this new direction. Maya later calls Israel to ask him out on a date, despite his failed speech. On the date, Maya sincerely shares some of her struggles with idealism and reality only for Israel to crudely dismiss them as irrelevant and attempt to flaunt his wealth in front of her. Pierce offers to work with Israel on the legal brief for plea reform he has been preparing, but Israel is unethusiastic.
Pierce calls Israel to meet a new client with him who is in custody only for Israel to learn that the client is Johnson himself. After Pierce departs, Johnson accuses Israel of turning him in for the reward, divulging privileged communications for personal gain. Having accepted that he will spend the rest of his life in prison, Johnson's only goal is to torment Israel and see that he also ends up behind bars. Confronted by his crime, Israel suffers a breakdown and renounces his greedy, self-centered worldview. After attempting to flee town, Israel reverses course after realizing that he cannot escape his own hypocrisy.
Israel reconciles with Maya and Pierce and tries to motivate them to pursue their inner sense of justice. He reveals that he intends to turn himself in to the police for his crime. While walking to the police precinct to surrender himself, Israel is shot and killed by one of Johnson's henchmen. In the aftermath of Israel's death, Maya is seen to be renewed in her activism efforts, while Pierce files Israel’s massive brief in Federal Court intending to reform plea bargaining after enlisting the help of his firm's employees for the benefit of the larger community."
Coco,"In Santa Cecilia, Mexico, Imelda Rivera is the wife of a musician, who leaves her and their 3-year-old daughter Coco, to pursue a career in music. When he never returns, Imelda banishes music from her life and that of her family and starts a shoemaking business with her family.
About 96 years later, Imelda's great-great-grandson, 12-year-old Miguel, now lives with Coco and their family. Miguel secretly dreams of becoming a musician like Ernesto de la Cruz, a popular actor and singer of Coco's generation. One day, Miguel inadvertently damages the picture frame holding a photo of Coco with her parents at the center of the family ofrenda and removes the photograph, discovering that his great-great-grandfather (whose face had been torn out) was holding Ernesto's famous guitar.
Concluding that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather, Miguel leaves to enter a talent show for the Day of the Dead despite the objections of his grandmother Elena. He enters Ernesto's mausoleum and takes his guitar to use in the show, but becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his Xoloitzcuintli dog Dante and his skeletal dead relatives who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him there, they realize that Imelda cannot visit, as Miguel removed her photo from the ofrenda. Discovering that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, Miguel must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family using an Aztec marigold petal that can undo the curse placed upon him when he stole Ernesto's guitar. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing, but on the condition that he abandon his musical pursuits when he returns to the Land of the Living. Miguel refuses and attempts to seek Ernesto's blessing.
Miguel encounters Héctor, a down-on-his-luck skeleton who once played music with Ernesto, and offers to help Miguel reach him. In return, Héctor asks Miguel to take his photo back to the Land of the Living so he can visit his daughter before she forgets him and he disappears completely. Upon learning he has other relatives, however, Héctor attempts to return Miguel to them, but Miguel escapes and infiltrates Ernesto's mansion, learning along the way that an old friendship between the two deteriorated before Héctor's death. Ernesto welcomes Miguel as his descendant, but Héctor confronts them, imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. After an argument between Ernesto and Héctor, Miguel soon realizes that Ernesto murdered Héctor using a poisoned drink and stole the songs Héctor had written, passing them off as his own to become famous.
To maintain his legacy, Ernesto steals the photo and has Miguel and Héctor thrown into a cenote pit. Miguel realizes that Héctor is his actual great-great-grandfather and that Coco is Héctor's daughter, the only living person who still remembers him. With the help of Dante – who turns into an alebrije – the dead Riveras find and rescue the duo. Miguel reveals that Héctor's decision to return home to Imelda and Coco resulted in his death, and Imelda and Héctor gradually reconcile. They infiltrate Ernesto's sunrise concert to retrieve Héctor's photo from Ernesto and his crimes are revealed to everyone. Ernesto is crushed by a falling church bell as in his previous life, but Héctor's photo falls into the water and disappears.
As the sun rises, Héctor is in danger of being forgotten by Coco and disappearing. Imelda and Héctor bless Miguel with no conditions attached so he can return to the Land of the Living to try and help Coco remember her father. Miguel plays ""Remember Me"", a song Héctor wrote for her during her childhood. The song revitalizes her memory of Héctor, and she gives Miguel the torn-out piece of the photo from the ofrenda, which shows Héctor's face, and tells her family stories about her father, thus keeping the memory of him alive. Elena reconciles with Miguel, accepting music back into the family.
One year later, Miguel proudly presents the family ofrenda – including the restored photo of Héctor and Imelda – to his new baby sister Socorro as Elena adds a photo of the now-deceased Coco. Letters kept by Coco contain evidence that Ernesto stole Héctor's songs. As a result, Ernesto's legacy is destroyed, and the community honors Héctor instead. In the Land of the Dead, Héctor and Imelda join Coco for a visit to the living Riveras as Miguel sings and plays for his dead and living relatives."
Darkest Hour,"In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demands the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party advisers that he wants Lord Halifax as his successor, but Halifax does not want to become Prime Minister yet. Chamberlain must choose the only other man whom other parties will support: Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty.
Churchill tries to dismiss his new secretary Elizabeth Layton for mis-hearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife Clementine. King George VI reluctantly invites Churchill to form a government including Chamberlain and Halifax.
Although he was right about the danger from Adolf Hitler, Churchill has a poor reputation because of his record in the Admiralty, the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War, his views on India and his support for Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis. Parliament reacts coolly to Churchill's first speech promising ""Blood, toil, tears and sweat,"" for which he is chastised by the King. Churchill refuses to negotiate for peace, believing that the Germans are untrustworthy, but the French Prime Minister thinks him delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the Battle of France. Halifax and Chamberlain agree, keen to use Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Bastianini as intermediary to negotiate with Germany. They plan to resign from the government if Churchill refuses, to cause a vote of no confidence that will allow Halifax to become Prime Minister.
The British Expeditionary Force is trapped at Dunkirk and Calais. Against the advice of the War Cabinet, Churchill orders Brigadier Claude Nicholson in Calais to lead the 30th Infantry Brigade in a suicide attack to distract the enemy while the soldiers at Dunkirk evacuate.
Defeat in France causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with Germany. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill; the King, not wanting to rule in exile should Britain be invaded, encourages the Prime Minister to continue the war. Still uncertain of what to do, Churchill decides to ask London Underground passengers; the civilians want to continue to fight. Churchill meets with the Outer Cabinet[11] and other members of Parliament, who also support him. The evacuation of troops from Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo, is successful.
As Churchill prepares to address Parliament, Halifax asks Chamberlain to continue with their plan to resign, but Chamberlain decides to listen to the address first. Towards the end of his speech, Churchill proclaims that ""We shall fight on the beaches"" should the Germans invade. Chamberlain decides to support Churchill, and Parliament applauds the Prime Minister's defiance."
Call Me by Your Name,"Elio, a 17-year-old Jewish-American-Italian youth, lives with his parents in rural Northern Italy. His father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old Jewish-American graduate student, Oliver, to live with him and his family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective bibliophile and musical prodigy, initially finds little in common with Oliver, who has a contrastingly carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom for Oliver for the duration of his stay. He spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with his girlfriend, Marzia. Oliver is meanwhile attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.
Elio and Oliver begin a seductive courtship: they swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to Oliver. He sneaks into Oliver's room to smell his bathing suit, and thinks about him while masturbating. During a trip to the post office, Elio confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, Elio and Oliver kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. The two grow distant.
In response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a note on Elio's desk telling Elio to meet him at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and they have sex. They become more physically and emotionally intimate over the next few days, having sex frequently while keeping their relationship secret. Smitten with Oliver by this point, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.
As the end of Oliver's stay approaches, the couple find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are aware of the bond between the two, recommend they visit Bergamo together before Oliver returns to the United States. After spending three romantic days together, Elio, heartbroken, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up and take him home. Marzia, who still wants to be friends with Elio, is sympathetic; his father, seeing Elio's sadness, tells him he was aware of their relationship, confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth, and urges Elio to find pleasure in his grief.
During Hanukkah, Oliver telephones Elio and his family to tell them he is engaged to be married. Oliver tells Elio he ""remembers everything"" very clearly. After the call, Elio sits by the fireplace, distraught, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner."
The Disaster Artist,"San Francisco, 1998: 19-year-old Greg Sestero meets Tommy Wiseau in acting classes with Jean Shelton. Shelton criticizes Tommy's protracted performance of a scene from A Streetcar Named Desire, but Greg is impressed by Tommy's fearlessness and the two become friends. On Tommy's suggestion, they move to Los Angeles to pursue acting careers. Sestero discovers that Wiseau can afford apartments in both San Francisco and Los Angeles, but Wiseau will not discuss his personal life nor the source of his wealth.
Greg signs with Iris Burton, a talent agent, while Tommy faces rejection from agencies, casting directors, and Hollywood insiders. Greg develops a relationship with Amber, whom he meets at her job at a nightclub, and Tommy grows jealous; as he fails to find work, he becomes disheartened. As Greg's auditions also dry up, he shares his frustrations with Tommy, who decides to make a movie for them both to star in.
Tommy writes a screenplay titled The Room, a melodrama about a love triangle between banker Johnny (played by Tommy), his fiancée Lisa and his best friend Mark. Greg reluctantly accepts the role of Mark and an associate producer credit. They rent out a production house; Tommy insists on buying all the production equipment and shooting the film on 35 mm film and HD Digital simultaneously, costly and unnecessary measures. The employees introduce Tommy to Raphael Smadja and Sandy Schklair, who work as his cinematographer and script supervisor respectively.
Production starts smoothly, but Tommy is difficult to work with. He forgets his lines, arrives late, and refuses to supply his crew with basic needs such as drinking water, even as an actor faints. During preparation for a sex scene, Tommy humiliates actress Juliette Danielle by pointing out her acne to the crew. Having filmed extensive behind-the-scenes footage, Tommy reveals that he knows everybody hates him, and believes that nobody, including Greg, supports his vision.
Greg and Amber run into Malcolm in the Middle star Bryan Cranston, who invites Greg to fill in for a small lumberjack part in a Malcolm episode. The part requires a beard; as Greg is due to shave his beard for The Room, he begs Tommy to postpone shooting, but Tommy refuses. On the last day of shooting, Greg accuses Tommy of being selfish and duplicitous throughout their friendship, and questions his real age and origins, before storming off set.
Eight months later, Amber and Greg have split up and Greg is working in theatre. Tommy invites Greg to the premiere of The Room; to his surprise, the entire cast and crew attend. The audience react first with horror then laughter at the film. Tommy bursts into tears and walks out, but Greg comforts him, telling him they have delighted the audience, not angered them. With a renewed mindset, Tommy returns to the theater as the credits roll, takes credit for his ""comedic"" movie, and receives a standing ovation.
Real-life clips of Wiseau attending screenings of The Room play, and title cards explain that the film made $1,800 against its reported $6 million budget during its initial release (Wiseau kept it running for two weeks, allegedly to qualify for the Academy Awards), but it has since become a profitable cult film. Wiseau and Sestero remain friends and, to this day, Wiseau's age, past life and source of income remain a mystery. Scenes from The Room are then compared side-by-side with reenactments of the scenes performed by The Disaster Artist's cast.
In a post-credits scene, Wiseau has an odd verbal exchange with a party goer (played by the real Wiseau), who offers to hang out, but Wiseau refuses."
The Shape of Water,"Elisa Esposito, who was found in a river as an orphaned child with wounds on her neck, is mute, and communicates through sign language. She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema, and works as a cleaning woman at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore at the height of the Cold War. Her friends are her closeted next-door neighbor Giles, a struggling advertising illustrator who shares a strong bond with her, and her African-American co-worker Zelda, a woman who also serves as her interpreter at work.
The facility receives a mysterious creature captured from a South American river by Colonel Richard Strickland, who is in charge of the project to study it. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a humanoid amphibian. She begins visiting him in secret, and the two form a close bond.
Seeking to exploit the creature to American advantage in the Space Race, General Frank Hoyt orders Strickland to vivisect it. One scientist, Robert Hoffstetler—who is in truth a Soviet spy named Dimitri Mosenkov—pleads unsuccessfully to keep the creature alive for further study and, at the same time, is ordered by his Soviet handlers to euthanize the creature. When Elisa learns of the Americans' plans for the creature, she persuades Giles to help her free him. Mosenkov discovers Elisa's plot and chooses to help her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda becomes involved in the escape, and it is successful.
Elisa keeps the creature in her bathtub, adding salt to the water to keep him alive. She plans to release the creature into a nearby canal when it will be opened to the ocean in several days' time. As part of his efforts to recover the creature, Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, but the failure of his advances toward Elisa hampers his judgment, and he dismisses them. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the creature devouring one of his cats, Pandora. Startled, the creature slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. The creature gets as far as the cinema downstairs before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. The creature touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm; the next morning, Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. Elisa and the creature soon become romantically involved, having sex in her bathroom, which she at one point fills completely with water.
Hoyt gives Strickland an ultimatum, asking him to recover the creature within 36 hours. Meanwhile, Mosenkov is told by his handlers that he will be extracted in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the creature's health starts deteriorating. Mosenkov leaves to rendezvous with his handlers, with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Mosenkov is shot by one of his handlers, but Strickland shoots the handlers dead and then tortures Mosenkov for information. Mosenkov implicates Elisa and Zelda before dying from his wounds. Strickland then threatens Zelda in her home, causing her terrified husband to reveal that Elisa had been keeping the creature. Strickland searches Elisa's apartment and finds a calendar note revealing when and where she plans to release him.
At the canal, Elisa and Giles bid farewell to the creature, but Strickland arrives and attacks them all. Strickland knocks Giles down and shoots the creature and Elisa, who both appear to die. However, the creature heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the creature takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where, deep under water, he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on her neck, they open to reveal gills like his. In a closing voice-over narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived ""happily ever after"" with the creature."

Carolina, the daughter of Humpty Rannell, arrives at the boardwalk looking for Ginny Rannell, her father's second wife who works as a waitress at the clam shack. She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI.

He and Carolina accidentally meet some time later, and becomes attracted by Carolina's story. He thinks he is in love with her, but is conflicted with his feelings for Ginny. Ginny steals money from Humpty to buy Mickey an expensive watch as a birthday present, which he refuses to accept. By this time, Ginny has become suspicious of Mickey's feelings for Carolina and is jealous.
Mobsters Angelo and Nick come around, asking Humpty, and the owner of the clam shack, about Carolina's whereabouts. Carolina takes Mickey on a date to a Brooklyn pizza parlor, and her boss innocently tells this to Angelo and Nick. Ginny telephones the pizza parlor to warn Carolina but begins to stutter, realizing her opportunity to have Carolina away from Mickey, and hangs up. Mickey tells Carolina the whole truth about his feelings for her and his affair. Instantly feeling compassionate for everyone involved, Carolina decides to walk home alone to process the information and decide what she should do, not wanting to hurt Ginny or her father or Mickey. We see Angelo and Nick's car following her as she leaves the pizza parlor.
When Carolina doesn't come home, Humpty asks Mickey the next day if he saw her after the date. Mickey investigates, and finds out Ginny called the pizza parlor but didn't speak. Piecing it together, he confronts Ginny, who has started drinking and getting made up in one of her glamorous stage costumes. She pulls a knife out of the drawer and asks Mickey to kill her, but he leaves. Humpty comes back, sinking back into alcoholism after the police found no trace of Carolina, and tells Ginny he needs her help again to function in life. He tries to find a positive outlook and invites her to meet his friends wives on a fishing trip they take but she coldly refuses, keeping their rut in life status quo."
"I, Tonya","In 1970s Portland, Oregon, three-year-old Tonya Harding is impelled to ice skate by her abusive mother, LaVona. As Tonya grows up, LaVona takes her out of school to focus on her skating career, and she trains extensively under coach Diane Rawlinson. Tonya quickly becomes one of the best figure skaters in the United States, but is unable to move beyond her ""white trash"" reputation, homemade costumes and unconventional choice of performance music. At 15, Tonya begins dating 18-year-old Jeff Gillooly despite her mother's disapproval. Tonya marries Jeff in order to move out of her mother's home, but soon Jeff begins physically abusing her as well. LaVona scorns Tonya for putting up with it, but Tonya blames LaVona for raising her in an abusive environment.
Meanwhile, Tonya becomes the first American female figure skater to complete two triple axel jumps in competition. However, Tonya fails to stick her landings and comes in fourth place at the Olympics. Defeated, she returns to Portland and takes a job as a waitress, but her first coach Diane Rawlinson convinces her to train for the 1994 Winter Olympics. Tonya visits her estranged mother who chastises her for seeking kindness, claiming that she made her a champion, knowing she'd hate her for it.
After Tonya's confidence is shaken by a death threat; Jeff realises he can do the same to Tonya's main rival Nancy Kerrigan. However, Jeff's delusional friend Shawn Eckhart, seeking notoriety and prestige, hires two inept crooks to attack Kerrigan after a practice session in Detroit. Kerrigan's knee is badly injured by Shane Stant, and both men involved are soon arrested. Eckhardt's bragging around town quickly leads the FBI to him. He points the finger at Jeff, who is horrified to learn that Eckhardt gave orders beyond sending death threats via letters. Tonya qualifies for the Olympic team amid the allegations that she was involved in Kerrigan's attack. Realizing that she will be found guilty by the association, she goes to the FBI and tells them what Jeff and Shawn did, who then show her written testimony to Jeff during the interview, and he races to her house to attack her. Tonya leaves him for good and he implicates her to the authorities, claiming she knew about the attack.
At the Olympics, Tonya comes in eighth place and Kerrigan wins the silver medal. Back in Portland, Tonya finds herself in a media circus. LaVona visits Tonya and offers her kind words; she finally tells her she is proud of her and that she is on her side. However, when LaVona asks if Tonya knew anything about the attack, Tonya realizes she is wearing a recording device and ejects her from her home. Jeff, Eckhardt and Stant are all sentenced, with Tonya's trial postponed until after the Olympics. Tonya avoids jail but is given three years probation, 500 hours of community service, and a $100,000 fine. She is also forced to withdraw from the 1994 World Figure Skating Championships and is banned from competitive figure skating for life. Heartbroken, she begs the judge to give her jail time rather than take away the one thing she knows how to do; the judge declines. Jeff acknowledges that he ruined Tonya's career, changes his name and remarries. Tonya embraces her notoriety and becomes a boxer, while becoming a nurturing mother to her own children."

Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"Shortly after the battle of Starkiller Base,[N 1] Resistance forces, led by General Leia Organa, flee D'Qar when a First Order fleet arrives. Poe Dameron leads a costly counterattack that destroys a First Order dreadnought, but after the Resistance escapes to hyperspace, the First Order tracks them and attacks the Resistance convoy. Kylo Ren, Leia's son, hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence, but his TIE fighter wingmen destroy the bridge, incapacitating Leia and killing most of their leadership, including Admiral Ackbar; Leia manages to survive by using the Force. Disapproving of new leader Vice Admiral Holdo's passive strategy, Poe helps Finn, BB-8, and mechanic Rose Tico embark on a secret mission to disable the tracking device on the lead ship.
Meanwhile, Rey arrives on Ahch-To with Chewbacca and R2-D2 aboard the Millennium Falcon to recruit Luke Skywalker to the Resistance. Disillusioned by his failure to train Kylo as a Jedi, and under self-imposed exile from the Force, Luke refuses to help—even after he learns of Han Solo's death at Kylo's hands—and believes that the Jedi should become extinct. Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo can communicate through the Force, puzzling the two enemies. As the rival Force users learn about each other, each has future visions of themselves as partners.
R2-D2 persuades Luke to train Rey. After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side of the Force, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that Supreme Leader Snoke was corrupting him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To to confront Kylo without Luke. Luke prepares to burn the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but hesitates. Yoda's ghost appears and destroys the temple by summoning a thunderstorm, claiming Rey has all she needs to learn, and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.
Holdo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions cowardly and risky, Poe leads a mutiny. Finn, Rose, and BB-8 travel to the Canto Bight casino and acquire the help of the hacker DJ, who says he can help them disable the tracking device. They infiltrate Snoke's ship, but all but BB-8 are captured by Captain Phasma. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who claims that he facilitated the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and, with Rey, defeats Snoke's guards. Rey believes that Kylo has returned to the light side of the Force, but he instead invites her to rule the galaxy with him, which she refuses. They use the Force to fight for possession of Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, which splits in two.
Leia recovers and stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned Rebel Alliance base on Crait. DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snoke's fleet at lightspeed; Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Phasma, and they join survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with old speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw the TIE fighters away with the Falcon, while Rose stops Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which subsequently penetrates the Resistance fortress.
Luke appears and confronts the First Order to enable surviving Resistance members to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke to no effect. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes he has been fighting a Force projection of him. Rey uses the Force to help the Resistance escape on the Falcon. Luke, exhausted, dies peacefully on Ahch-To. His death is sensed by Rey and Leia, but Leia tells surviving rebels that the Resistance has all it needs to rise again. At Canto Bight, one of the children who helped Finn and Rose escape grabs a broom with the Force and gazes into space."
Ferdinand,"In Spain, a ranch owned by Moreno (Raúl Esparza) that trains bulls for bullfighting called Casa del Toro harbours a bull calf named Ferdinand (Colin H. Murphy). He is ridiculed by his fellow calves Bones (Nile Diaz), Guapo (Jet Jurgensmeyer), and Valiente (Jack Gore) for being non-confrontational and his tendency to smell and protect flowers. A saddened Ferdinand runs away from Casa del Toro after his father Raf (Jeremy Sisto) does not return from the bull fight he was picked for and a flower he was fond of was flattened by Valiente after his own father was defeated by Raf. He eventually awakens at a florist's farm, and is adopted by the owner Juan (Juanes), his dog Paco (Jerrod Carmichael), and his daughter Nina (Julia Saldanha) with whom he shares a bond.
When Ferdinand (John Cena) eventually grows up into an enormous bull, he still retains his non-violent, flower-loving nature. Due to his size, he is left alone when Juan, Nina (Lily Day), and Paco go to Ronda for an annual flower festival. Ferdinand decides to go anyway, resulting in him getting stung by a bee and unintentionally causing chaos around town and is taken away back to Casa del Toro, much to his and the family’s sadness.
Once back there, he finds that Bones (Anthony Anderson), Guapo (Peyton Manning), and Valiente (Bobby Cannavale) have also grown up and have been joined by a Scottish bull named Angus (David Tennant) and a silent but intimidating bull named Maquina (Tim Nordquist). Ferdinand is still disrespected by the bulls, but manages to befriend a crazy goat named Lupe (Kate McKinnon) who wants to be his coach in bullfighting despite his lack of interest and three hedgehogs named Una (Gina Rodriguez), Dos (Daveed Diggs), and Cuatro (Gabriel Iglesias) who frequently invade Casa del Toro to steal food. They used to have another brother named Tres, but they claim he is dead.
One day, a legendary but egotistical bullfighter named El Primero (Miguel Ángel Silvestre) arrives at Casa del Toro to choose the biggest, strongest, and most aggressive bull to fight against before he retires. When the bulls fail to impress him on their first try, Guapo is taken to a nearby slaughterhouse and the other bulls tell Ferdinand that it will eventually be their fate if they are not chosen for a bullfight. Although Ferdinand manages to earn the respect of the other bulls, except Valiente, after a dance-off with three German horses (Sally Phillips, Flula Borg and Boris Kodjoe), they still hold on to the belief that fighting is the only way for them to live. Ferdinand manages to convince Lupe to come back with him to Nina's farm and the hedgehogs help them escape, but when Ferdinand is close to freedom, he sees his father's picture on a wall with his horns mounted, along with dozens of other horns, making him realize that every bull who is chosen to fight gets slain by the matador.
Ferdinand explains to the other bulls that they will all eventually be killed even if they are chosen to fight. Valiente is the only one unconvinced and charges Ferdinand outside where Ferdinand inadvertently beats him in a fight and knocks off his right horn, much to the other animals' shock. Primero witnesses the scuffle, and chooses Ferdinand to fight him after seeing him defeat Valiente. When Valiente is taken to the slaughterhouse, Ferdinand rallies up the remaining bulls to escape but first goes to the slaughterhouse to break out Valiente. He at first refuses as he believes that the slaughterhouse is his fate now, but they discover that Guapo is still alive, and Ferdinand questions Valiente's courage after Valiente refuses to help him rescue Guapo. When Ferdinand tries to save Guapo, he accidentally activates a series of deadly contraptions, but with the help of a now-friendlier Valiente, they escape the slaughterhouse. The bulls, Lupe, the hedgehogs and a red bunny rabbit steal the training area's company truck to escape, with Moreno and his employees giving chase.
The animals try desperately to lose the humans and wind up at Atocha train station in Madrid that Ferdinand sees as his ticket back to Nina. When the bulls push a small railroad cart to catch the train back to Nina's home, Ferdinand sacrifices himself so the other bulls can escape (except for Lupe, who stays behind in shock after Ferdinand's act) and is captured by Moreno and his employees. When Nina leans of Ferdinand's upcoming fight with El Primero, she and Juan set out to Madrid to find and rescue Ferdinand.
At Las Ventas bullfight arena, Lupe tries to convince Ferdinand that he must fight in order to survive, but Ferdinand is silently unsure. When Ferdinand is released into the bullfight ring, he refuses to fight at first but is urged into fighting by El Primero. While being forced to run into Primero’s cape, Ferdinand is able to grab the cape from Primero with his horn and is temporarily blinded by it. Primero attempts to grab his cape back from Ferdinand, but is accidentally tossed out of the ring by Ferdinand. Primero re-enters the ring angrily and attacks Ferdinand using banderillas, striking him in the shoulder. Ferdinand almost retaliates against him, but sees a carnation underneath his hoof and realizes he is becoming the fighter he was determined not to be. As Primero draws his sword in order to finish Ferdinand, the crowd begins to cheer for Ferdinand, convincing Primero to spare him. Ferdinand is reunited with Nina, who embraces him as the crowd throws carnations to the ring to praise the bull. The other bulls arrive, thinking they are too late to save Ferdinand, but instead witness Ferdinand making history as the first bull to ever make it out of a bullfight alive by being himself.
In the end, Ferdinand returns home with Nina, Juan, and Paco. They are joined by the other bulls, the hedgehogs, the bunny, and Lupe, who all move into the farm. The film ends with Ferdinand, his bull friends, and Lupe watching the sunset over Ronda from a field of flowers.
In a brief mid-credits scene, the hedgehogs are confronted by Tres who is revealed to have been alive the whole time."
Beyond Skyline,"Mark Corley, a Los Angeles police detective, helps his estranged son, Trent, out of jail just as an alien invasion begins. The entire population of the city is sucked into various spaceships by a blue light. Mark leads a group of surviving humans through underground subway tunnels to escape, though most of the humans are killed or abducted one by one. The survivors – Mark, Trent, transit operator Audrey, and a homeless man known only as ""Sarge"", who is immune to the blue light due to his blindness – escape to the marina following its nuclear destruction, only to be abducted into the alien flagship by a towering alien tanker.
On board the spaceship, Mark tries to find his son and storms his way into various chambers, where he meets up with survivor Elaine and her transformed boyfriend Jarrod (from the first film). Elaine explains that Jarrod retained control of his mind despite being transformed into a bio-mechanical alien soldier. Though Elaine is three months pregnant, her pregnancy has accelerated and she gives birth to a newborn daughter. Elaine dies during the delivery, and Mark and Jarrod team up to destroy the alien ship by setting alien explosives inside the ship's control systems. As Jarrod fights various alien warriors, Mark rescues Audrey but is too late to save his son. Trent has his brain taken and placed in another alien bio-mechanical machine creature. Sarge sacrifices himself so that Mark, Audrey and the baby can escape from the chamber. Jarrod is killed when he fights the alien leader but destroys the ship, which crashes in rural Laos.
As the alien spaceship repairs itself, Mark, Audrey and the baby are found by a pair of human siblings, outlaw Sua and his sister Kanya, who are evading both aliens and local militia. As they trek through the jungle, the group discovers that the human baby grows at an accelerated rate from a newborn into a three-year-old in just one day. Sua and Kanya lead Mark, Audrey and the baby to a hidden human resistance hideout located in local ruins. There, Harper, a medical officer and former drug smuggler, examines the baby girl and learns about her unique DNA. Harper believes her blood may be the key to defeating the aliens due to her evolving DNA. Using the child's blood and recovered alien technology, Harper develops a serum he believes will free the bio-mechanical soldiers from alien control and restore their human personality. Though Sua insists on killing all the bio-mechanical soldiers, Mark convinces Sua to allow him to save Trent.
While on a patrol, Kanya encounters a four-legged tanker alien and sacrifices herself by luring it into an old minefield left over from the Vietnam war. Though she destroys it, she unwittingly gives away their location to the alien ships searching for the human newborn child. They converge on the human base. During the resulting battle, several members of the human resistance, including Harper, are killed. Mark enters a grounded alien ship, where he uses Harper's serum to turn the mind-controlling blue light into a red light that frees the mind-controlled bio-mechanical soldiers. Before he can deploy it, the alien leader and his horde of alien warriors attacks the human resistance and disables the light. Trent, his mind restored after encountering his father, fights back inside a giant alien tanker. While the alien leader is busy fighting Trent, the child fixes and deploys the red light, freeing the bio-mechanical soldiers, and Trent defeats the alien leader. With Earth saved, Audrey names the girl Rose after Mark's deceased wife.
Ten years later, Rose, now a fully-grown adult, has taken control of an alien ship, and Trent is her second-in-command. Rose leads freed bio-mechanical soldiers and humans in an assault on the other alien ships around the moon, including the mothership."
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,"In 1996 in Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke receives the Jumanji board game which was found by his father on a beach after it was thrown over a bridge by Alan Parrish and Sarah Whittle 27 years earlier. Alex sets the game aside. That night, it transforms into a video game cartridge which catches Alex's attention when he is awakened by the Jumanji drums and he is transported into the game.
Twenty years later, in 2016, four Brantford High School students serve detention: Spencer Gilpin, caught writing an essay for former friend Anthony ""Fridge"" Johnson (also in detention); Bethany Walker, who made a video call during an English-class quiz and Martha Kaply, who refused to participate in gym class. They are sent to the school basement to prepare magazines for recycling and to think about their future. Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video-game system when he explores the basement, and he and Spencer set up the game. Although it has five playable characters, the first one cannot be selected. Spencer and Fridge choose two characters, and the girls choose their own. When Spencer presses ""Start"", they are transported into the game.
They are in a jungle, in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is tough, muscular explorer and archaeologist Smolder Bravestone; Fridge is diminutive zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar, whom he chose after misreading ""Mouse"" as ""Moose""; Bethany is chubby male cartographer and intellectual Sheldon ""Shelly"" Oberon (whose nickname she mistook for a woman's), and Martha is beautiful commando and martial arts expert Ruby Roundhouse. They each have three lives; Spencer deduces that if they lose all three, they really die.
They learn the game's story from NPC Nigel: corrupt archeologist Russel Van Pelt stole the Jaguar's Eye (a magic jewel) from its shrine, cursing Jumanji. Nigel escaped Van Pelt with the jewel, and the players must return it to a jaguar statue and call ""Jumanji"" to lift the curse. Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanji's animals. They begin tackling the game's increasingly-difficult ""levels"", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex (the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough). Taking shelter in a jungle house built by Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home. They break into a transportation shed, commandeering a helicopter to fly to the jaguar statue and return the jewel, but Fridge drops the jewel into a herd of white rhinoceros. Spencer uses one of Fridge's lives, pushing him out of the helicopter as a distraction, and retrieves the jewel. Alex loses his last life when a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR and transfers one of her lives to him.
At the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelt's forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha (trapped in a pit of mambas) and demands the jewel, but she sacrifices one of her lives to re-spawn and get it to Spencer. With the players on their last lives, they end the game with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of rats and return to the real world; Nigel bids them farewell, but Alex does not appear with them. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, returning to where he left off in 1996. Now married with children, he named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life and introduces them to his infant son, Andy.
Spencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany begins caring for others than herself and plans a summer backpacking adventure, Martha and Spencer become romantically involved and the four are now friends after their experiences in the game. When they hear Jumanji's drumbeats, they bring the game behind the school and Fridge destroys it with a bowling ball (also found in detention) to prevent anyone from playing it again."
The Greatest Showman,"P. T. Barnum and his troupe perform a show at the circus. (""The Greatest Show"") In a flashback to Barnum's childhood where he and his father Philo, a tailor, work for the Hallett family, and he becomes infatuated with their daughter, Charity. Though Charity is being sent to finishing school, Barnum reassures her they will not be separated. The two keep in touch through letters until they meet again in adulthood (""A Million Dreams""), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City (""A Million Dreams"" reprise). They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum dreams of more.
Barnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes bankrupt. Taking a risky bet, he takes out a large loan from a bank, deceiving the bank into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He uses this loan to buy Barnum's American Museum in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially, sales are slow; on the suggestion of his children to showcase something ""alive"", Barnum searches for ""freaks"" to serve as performers for his museum (""Come Alive""). This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor reviews, prompting Barnum to rename his venture ""Barnum's Circus"".
Searching for ways to further his reputation amongst the upper class, Barnum meets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture (""The Other Side""). Carlyle is enchanted with Anne Wheeler, an African-American trapeze artist, but he hides his feelings. During a trip Carlyle arranged for Barnum and his troupe to meet Queen Victoria, Barnum meets Jenny Lind, a famed Swedish singer, whom he convinces to perform in America, with him serving as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing success (""Never Enough""). While Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic patrons, he begins to distance himself from his original troupe, refusing to socialize with them. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers (""This Is Me"").
Carlyle and Wheeler attend the theatre together one night, only to run into Carlyle's parents, who insult Wheeler's lowly status, causing her to leave. Carlyle chases her and tries to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him despite her feelings towards him (""Rewrite the Stars""). As Barnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home with their daughters (""Tightrope""). While on tour, Lind begins falling in love with Barnum, but when he refuses her advances, she calls off the tour and kisses him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press (""Never Enough"" reprise). Barnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Carlyle, who had tried to save Anne not knowing she had already escaped, is rescued by Barnum amid the chaos but suffers severe burns. Most of the sets and props are destroyed. Word of Lind's cancellation and Barnum's public intimacy also reaches New York, resulting in his mansion being foreclosed upon and Charity taking Caroline and Helen to her parents' home.
Depressed, Barnum retreats to a local pub, where his troupe find him there and persuade him to rebuild the circus. Barnum has an epiphany that causes him to realize the circus was for his friends and family rather than for himself (""From Now On""). Meanwhile, the injured Carlyle wakes in a hospital with Wheeler by his side and they share a kiss.
Barnum leaves and finds his estranged wife, and they decide to mend their relationship. Faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus, the recovering Carlyle steps in, offering to use his earnings from his share of the circus's profits to rebuild it under the condition of becoming partners, which Barnum happily accepts. As rebuilding the circus in its original location would be too expensive, Barnum rebuilds it as an open-air tent circus by the docks. The revamped circus is a huge success, and Barnum gives full control of the show to Carlyle so he can focus on his family (""The Greatest Show"" reprise)."
Pitch Perfect 3,"Three years after the events of the second movie, the Bellas have graduated college, but have jobs which they all hate. Desperate to see each other again to sing once more, Beca (Anna Kendrick), Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), Chloe (Brittany Snow), Aubrey (Anna Camp), Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), Stacie (Alexis Knapp), Cynthia-Rose (Ester Dean), Florencia (Chrissie Fit), Jessica (Kelley Jakle), and Ashley (Shelley Regner) are all thrilled to learn that Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), now a senior at Barden and leader of the Barden Bellas, has seemingly asked for the Bellas to reunite at an event in New York Aquarium to sing with each other once more. Upon arriving at the reunion they are told that the reunion was not for the Bellas to sing together, but to watch Emily sing with the new Bellas.
They later gather at a bar in disappointment and Emily apologizes as she thought it would be the only way for them to see each other again. They all express how much they miss each other. Suddenly, Aubrey convinces them to join a USO performance accessed by her Army officer father. If they win the competition, they get to open for DJ Khaled. The Bellas gladly accept, all except for Stacie who is eight months pregnant at the moment and is unable to go with them. The Bellas later arrive at a hangar where two soldiers, Chicago (Matt Lanter) and Zeke (Troy Ian Hall) introduce them to their competition, revealed to be three other groups who use instruments, unlike the Bellas. When the band Evermoist, led by their leader Calamity (Ruby Rose) begin to mock and belittle the Bellas, the competitors are challenged to a riff-off by the Bellas, who leave defeated when the other groups compete using their musical instruments.
The Bellas are taken to a fancy hotel in Spain, where Chloe begins to catch an eye for Chicago. Fat Amy finds an old stuffed bunny sitting in her bed, which she recognizes as an old toy she used to hold when she was very little as her father Fergus (John Lithgow) sang her to sleep every night. Amy then realizes that her father is staying in the same hotel she is in and is shocked upon the discovery, seeing as how Fergus is a ruthless international crime lord. Later that night, the Bellas are invited to a party at DJ Khaled's suite at the hotel, where Fat Amy splits with the group when she is called to be at a poker tournament. The tournament was set up by Fergus, who promptly begs for Amy to be back in his life. A hesitant Amy finally agrees to do so after seeing how much he has changed. Beca, after having her breasts grabbed by Chloe, who develops a friendship with DJ Khaled's music producer Theo (Guy Burnet), is taken to DJ Khaled's music editing room. Beca produces a mix which impresses Theo who is prompted to send the mix to DJ Khaled. Moments later, the party is thrown into chaos when Aubrey accidentally sets the suite on fire.
The Bellas are left in disgrace after the incident with no hopes of winning the competition until Stacie calls the girls to inform she has given birth to a baby girl and named her Bella. This motivates the Bellas to just perform their hearts out without trying to win. Back at the USO competition, the Bellas perform tremendously to adoring crowds through different performances, repairing their reputation and chances to win in the process. Fergus is accepted by Amy, who believes he came to one of their performances to see her. He accidentally reveals that he has not seen her perform at all, while confessing that he is only trying to acquire an offshore account Amy's mother set up which contains US$180 million. After Amy shuts out Fergus again, Chicago and Zeke escort her away from her father, who swears revenge on her. Meanwhile, only Beca is asked personally by DJ Khaled to open for him, disregarding the other Bellas. Beca politely declines the offer and leaves to her room. Later, the Bellas are taken away by a Frenchman in a dark grey van out onto a yacht in a nearby harbor. The yacht belongs to Fergus, who is using the Bellas as a means to get Amy to come for him. Amy and Beca hear of the kidnapping and decide to rescue the Bellas. Beca distracts Fergus by having the Bellas perform ""Toxic"" for him and two of his men, just as Amy sets the yacht to explode. The Bellas escape the yacht just before it blows. Fergus survives the explosion and is arrested for his crimes.
After the Bellas are rescued by the military, Fat Amy reveals DJ Khaled's proposition to Beca to the others. They encourage her to take the chance, and they all agree that now it's time to move on with their lives, with Amy using her bank account for multiple tributes to singers named Amy, Aubrey trying to be a birthing coach, Flo's juice cart becoming part of an international brand, Chloe getting accepted into vet school, Cynthia-Rose staying at the base to get into flight school, Emily going back to Barden to prepare for her upcoming abnormal psychology test while continuing her songwriting, and Lilly revealing that the reason she was quiet was because she was possessed by Satan and the yacht incident snapped her out of it, and that her real name is Ester. They know very well they'll be separated, but still be connected to each other as a family. Later at the USO's final performance, Beca opens for DJ Khaled and sings on stage, and afterwards brings up the Bellas onstage for the girls to sing their final performance with the other competitors gladly watching the Bellas sing ""Freedom! '90"" to their hearts' content.
Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) (who were the Bellas' public announcers in the previous installments) finish filming the Bellas as part of a documentary they have been making about the girls throughout the whole film, only to be appalled when John realizes they didn't record the Bellas' final performance, which was supposed to be the documentary's big ending. A series of mid credit scenes reveal the Bellas' separate story arcs closed out to their mostly happy endings, with Lilly hanging around with DJ Dragon Nutz, whom she flirted with earlier, Aubrey reconnects with her father and Chloe and Chicago share a passionate kiss, much to the amusement of Beca, who is now the boss of Theo."
Downsizing,"In the future, searching for a way to solve overpopulation and global warming, a scientist invents ""downsizing"", a process to shrink people to a height of five inches. Paul and Audrey Safranek, a married couple in Omaha with financial problems, meet Dave and Carol Johnson, who have downsized. While the inventors advocate that downsizing is environmentally friendly through the reduction of waste, Dave argues that its benefits extend far beyond that and improve one's life through the increase in value of their money.
Exploring the possibilities of downsizing, Paul and Audrey agree to undergo the process and move to Leisureland, one of the most popular communities for small individuals. After undergoing downsizing, Paul receives a call from Audrey, saying that she was unable to go through the procedure and, by opting out at the last minute, will be leaving him.
One year later, Paul finalizes the divorce with Audrey, and settles in to his new apartment (ironically, a downsizing of its own from the mansion he was to originally share with Audrey). Although Paul had anticipated a life of relative ease, without Audrey's share of their assets, and with Paul's share shrunken further still due to divorce settlement negotiations, he works as a customer service representative for Lands' End. While attending a birthday party, Paul has a discussion with Dave and says that he regrets his decision to downsize. Soon after, Paul breaks up with his girlfriend and attends a party hosted by his neighbor Dušan.
The next morning, Paul notices that one of Dušan's housecleaners is Ngoc Lan Tran, a Vietnamese political activist who was jailed and downsized against her will. Ngoc Lan was the sole survivor of a human smuggling attempt to the United States in a television box and had her leg amputated upon arrival. Attempting to assist Ngoc Lan with her prosthetic leg, Paul returns to her house in the slums outside of the walls of Leisureland. After assisting Ngoc Lan's dying friend, Paul attempts to repair Ngoc Lan's prosthetic leg only to break it and render her unable to work. In return, Paul works for Ngoc Lan's cleaning service where he also assists in gathering food from around the city that Ngoc Lan distributes throughout the slums. Dušan attempts to release Paul from his obligation by taking him to Norway, the site of the first small community, with his friend Joris Konrad, but Ngoc Lan also wishes to come along. Ngoc Lan had received international attention after her arrival in the United States, including personal correspondence from the inventor of downsizing, Dr. Jørgen Asbjørnsen, who had previously invited her to Norway to express his regret at the abuse of his procedure.
While traveling in a fjord, Paul's boat encounters Dr. Asbjørnsen and his wife, Anne-Helene. Dr. Asbjørnsen announces that humanity is doomed, as the positive feedback of Arctic methane emissions cannot be stopped, and will result in the eventual extinction of the human race. Arriving in the first colony, Paul is shown that Dr. Asbjørnsen planned for such a contingency with the creation of a large vault inside a mountain to insulate the colony and preserve humanity in the event of an extinction. Paul is excited to enter the vault and asks Ngoc Lan to join him. She rejects his offer, saying that he does not need to enter the vault and can do good in their community by returning. Paul enters the vault, but changes his mind and leaves as the door is closing and subsequently blasted to seal the occupants inside, choosing to return with Ngoc Lan, Dušan, and Konrad.
Having returned to Leisureland, Paul assists Ngoc Lan in her duties of providing needed aid and supplies to the people of the slums."
Father Figures,"Kyle (Wilson) and Peter Reynolds (Helms) are fraternal twin brothers who were raised by their mother, Helen (Close), after thinking their father died before they were born. Kyle is dating his pregnant girlfriend, Kaylani, and has been financially successful after receiving royalties for his picture on hot sauce labels. Peter is a divorced proctologist with a teenage son who resents him. Shortly after his mother's wedding, Peter recognizes an actor on Law and Order: SVU as his father from his photo, and confronts his mother at her wedding.
Helen explained that she had been promiscuous at the time of her children's conception, and did not want their father to help raise them. As they press the issue, Helen reveals that their father is Terry Bradshaw. The brothers fly down to Florida to meet Bradshaw, who they encounter at a signing event. Bradshaw is excited to have them as sons, and welcomes them in to his home. As Bradshaw recounts stories with his friend and former teammate, Rod Hamilton (Rhames), Kyle and Peter realize that Bradshaw had been traveling in Australia at the time of their conception, and thus couldn't be their father.
The brothers are directed to find Roland Hunt (Simmons), a New York investor who dated Helen after Bradshaw. As they travel north, Kyle finds that his royalties deal with the hot sauce company is ending, and he will be unable to support his growing family. Upon arriving at what they assumed was his office, the brothers find a boarded-up house. Hunt, thinking they are robbers, confronts them at gunpoint until they reveal they were looking for him because he dated their mother. He invites them inside, but expresses his dissatisfaction at having children. As the brothers prepare to depart, they offer to help their father in his job, which he claims is a repossession man. As Hunt breaks into a Ferrari, it becomes clear that he is a criminal thief. As the brothers argue with the owners of the Ferrari, Hunt attempts to escape, only to feel remorse for abandoning his sons. The brothers steal the Ferrari and end up hitting Hunt, who was returning to find them. At the hospital, the brothers find that they are incompatible to give Hunt blood, indicating that he cannot be their father. Hunt realizes that he was in prison at the time of their conception, but directs them to find another of Helen's ex-boyfriends named Sparkly P.
Unable to find Sparky P, the brothers prepare to return home. Along the way, they pick up a hitch hiker (Williams), who provides advice as they travel north. After accidentally parking on railroad tracks, Peter and the hitch hiker narrowly escape getting hit by a train, while Kyle is stuck in the car and presumably killed. Initially devastated, Peter is surprised to see Kyle walk away from the car, only to be punched by Kyle for abandoning him. As they are being treated, the police officers recognize the name Sparkly P as Patrick O'Callaghan, a former police officer. As the brothers travel north, they stop at a hotel, where Peter meets and seduces Sarah (Aselton). The next morning, the brothers arrive at Patrick O'Callaghan's house to find a party occurring, only to quickly find out that it is his wake. Patrick's daughter is invited to speak, and Peter realizes that it is Sarah, his presumed half-sister. Disgusted, Peter makes a scene as he runs out of the wake, but is told by Patrick's twin brother, Kevin, that Patrick could not be his father, as he had been celibate while dating Helen. Kevin directs them to contact Dr. Walter Tinkler (Walken), who is a family friend and veterinarian from their home town.
Kyle and Peter return home to confront Dr. Tinkler. Helen arrives to explain that Tinkler is not their father, as she is not their biological mother. Helen explains that she had been working at a shelter when a woman came in and gave birth to twins. The mother died during childbirth, and Helen chose to adopt Kyle and Peter instead of having them become foster children. The brothers are happy to have learned their history, and reconcile their differences.
A year later, Kyle, Peter, and Helen are on vacation in Maui. Peter is now dating Sarah, and his son respects him. Kyle and Kaylani had twin daughters. The brothers have gone into business together and created an app that provides advice from the universe, spoken by the hitch hiker."
The Post,"In 1966 Vietnam, State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg accompanies U.S. troops in combat, documenting the progress of U.S. military activities in the region for Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On the flight home, McNamara expresses to Ellsberg and William Macomber his view that the war in Vietnam is hopeless, yet, upon landing, tells the press he has every confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg overhears this and becomes disillusioned. Years later, as a civilian military contractor working for the RAND Corporation, Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies classified reports documenting the country's decades-long involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, dating back to the Truman administration. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to reporters at The New York Times; the movie follows two weeks in 1971 at The Washington Post and the publishing of the Pentagon Papers.
Newspaper heiress Katharine Graham tries to balance her social life with her responsibility as owner and publisher of The Washington Post, following the deaths of her husband, Phil Graham, and her father, Eugene Meyer. She is troubled over preparations for the newspaper's stock-market launch, a move she recognizes as important for strengthening the paper's economic stability. Graham lacks experience and is frequently overruled by more assertive men who advise or work for her, such as editor-in-chief Ben Bradlee, and board member Arthur Parsons. Bradlee tries in vain to match The New York Times's ability to get scoops. Meanwhile, McNamara, Graham's longtime friend, confides in her that he is to be the subject of unflattering coverage by the Times. The story turns out to be an exposé of the government's long-running deception of the American public. However, the series is halted by a court injunction against further publication by the Times.
Post assistant editor Ben Bagdikian tracks down Ellsberg as the source for the leak, who provides Bagdikian with copies of the same material given to the Times. A hand-picked team of Post reporters sorts through the piles of papers, searching for the headline stories. The lawyers for the Post advise against publishing the material, lest the Nixon administration bring criminal charges against them. Graham talks to McNamara, Bradlee, and trusted Post chairman Fritz Beebe, agonizing over the decision of whether to publish. The situation is made even more complicated when the Post's lawyers discover that Bagdikian's source is the same as the Times's, possibly putting Graham in contempt of court. If charges are brought against the company, Graham could destroy the newspaper she sees as a family legacy. Alternately, if she were to win any legal challenge, the Post could instead establish itself as an important journalistic institution. She chooses to run the story.
The White House retaliates, and in short order the Post and Times appear together before the Supreme Court to plead their First Amendment argument for the right to publish the material. Meanwhile, newspapers across the country pick up the story in solidarity with the Post and Times. The court rules 6–3 in the newspapers' favor, vindicating Graham's decision. Nixon demands that the Post should be barred from the White House. One year later, security guard Frank Wills discovers a break-in in progress at the Watergate complex after a guest at the Watergate hotel called complaining about people using flashlights."
Bright,"In an alternate present, humans live in uneasy peace with orcs, elves, centaurs, dwarves and other races after they fought for thousands of years. In Los Angeles, veteran LAPD police officer Daryl Ward has been involuntarily partnered with Nick Jakoby, the nation's first orcish police officer. Jakoby is faced with prejudice by humans for his race, and by orcs for his position as an officer; Ward is ambivalent towards Jakoby after an incident in which he allowed an orc to escape causes Ward to question Jakoby's loyalities. A previously detained human Shield of Light devotee tells Jakoby that both officers are in a prophecy and that Ward is blessed. While booking the devotee, Ward is approached by Internal Affairs who say they believe that Jakoby put his racial loyalties before his partner. Ward is pressured to try to have Jakoby confess on tape so they will have grounds to fire Jakoby.
That night, Ward and Jakoby respond to a disturbance at what turns out to be a Shield of Light safe house; inside is evidence indicating magic was used. They apprehend the lone unhurt survivor, a young elf named Tikka in possession of a legendary magic wand who apparently only speaks Elfish. As Jakoby puts it, a wand is like ""a nuclear weapon that grants wishes"", and can only be commanded by a 'Bright'—a person with the rare ability to use magic. If a non-Bright touches a wand, they will explode from the raw magical power.
When four officers arrive as backup, their racial prejudice cause them to try and coerce Ward into killing Jakoby and lying about the incident, allowing them to steal the wand. Ward goes outside and questions him about the incident earlier with the orc; meanwhile the officers plan to kill Ward. Ward overhears this and decides to believe Jakoby and kills all four officers. The incident, however, attracts the attention of the local human gang Altamira, and the two flee with Tikka and the wand. Leilah, a member of the ominous group Inferni and owner of the wand, arrives at the safehouse minutes later, searching for the wand and Tikka.
The trio flee through the territory of the Fogteeth Orc clan, with the gang's leader, Poison, wanting to regain the use of his legs through the wand. The Inferni then appear and the ensuing fight gives the trio the opportunity to escape again. At a service station, Ward contacts his friend, Sheriff Deputy Rodriguez, who he hopes will help them in protecting the wand. Rodriguez contacts Kandomere, an elf working for the federal 'Magic Task Force'; dedicated to securing, containing and protecting magical objects. Kandomere tells Ward that he will be safe from prosecution for killing his fellow police officers, if they can keep the wand out of wrong hands. Before Rodriguez can bring them in, Leilah's henchmen attack the trio, killing him.
Ward, Jakoby, and Tikka run into the Fogteeth Orc clan again and are dragged before its leader Dorghu. Enraged at the chaos they are causing, Dorghu. He then orders his son, Mikey, to kill Jakoby after failing to find out here the wand is. However, Mikey reveals that he was the orc that Jakoby allowed to escape and thus refuses to kill him. Dorghu sends his son away and kills Jakoby himself. As he prepares to kill Ward, Tikka produces the wand she had magically hidden and uses it to resurrect Jakoby, revealing that she is a Bright. The cloaked clan priest pronounces this to be the will of the Prophecy, causing the clan to kneel to Jakoby and allow the trio to go free. Tikka, now trusting them, speaks to them in English for the first time and explains the Inferni's plan. They wish to resurrect The Dark Lord, an ancient mythical figure who will rise from the dead and take over the world. Once a member of the Inferni herself, Tikka had been protected by the Shield of Light and fled with the wand.
The use of the wand causes Tikka to become ill and the only way to save her to is place her in a pool back at the house where they found her. They return to the safehouse but are ambushed by Leilah and the remaining Inferni. The trio successfully kill the Inferni, but Leilah is resurrected. Just as Ward places Tikka in the magic pool, Leilah hangs Jakoby and knocks both Ward and Tikka out of the pool. Leilah unsuccessfully tries to convince Tikka to join her. Jakoby breaks free and shoots the wand out of Leilah's hand, but runs out of ammo before he can kill her again. Leilah is about to kill Tikka when Ward picks up the fallen wand and is revealed to also be a Bright, using the wand to kill Leilah with an explosion that sets the building on fire. In the ensuing commotion, Tikka disappears and the injured Ward and Jakoby flee from the building, with Jakoby saving an injured Ward. After rescuing Ward, Dorghu and his clan appear and perform an ancient orc ceremony signifying to Jakoby that he is now ""blooded"" - an Orcish status only achievable by an act of great bravery.
Ward awakens the next day in a hospital room to find Jakoby at his bedside and himself restrained as he is an ""extremely dangerous"" Bright. As Kandomere appears, Ward understands (but Jakoby does not) that Kandomere wants to contain the incident, and gives him a fake statement as to what happened, denying the use of magic. In a public announcement before a crowd, Jakoby and Ward are honored by the city for their actions against the 'extremist group' Inferni. Ward smiles as he spots Tikka moving through the crowd in disguise."
Crooked House,"The granddaughter of late business tycoon Aristide Leonides, Sophia Leonides, visits private investigator Charles Hayward in his office. Sophia hires Charles to investigate Aristide's death, for she believes he was murdered by a member of his sprawling and idiosyncratic family. Sophia notes that Leonides' regular insulin injection had been laced with eserine from his eye drops, the resulting chemicals in them causing him to die. Sophia believes this to have been a deliberate switch rather than accidental. Charles begrudgingly agrees to take on the case as a result of his feelings for Sophia as the two had enjoyed a brief love affair when they had met sometime prior in Cairo. Charles seeks the consent of Chief Inspector Taverner of Scotland Yard to look into the case, utilising his personal connection with Taverner, who had served with Charles's father, a decorated former Assistant Commissioner who was murdered.
Charles visits the Leonides estate and proceeds to interview the various members of the family, finding various motives from each. Charles begins with Lady Edith De Haviland, the sister of Leonides's first wife, who despised her brother-in-law and his callous attitude towards her grandchildren. Leonides's eldest son, Philip, hated his father for passing him over to run the family business and for refusing to take interest in a new play he'd written for his wife, Magda, a fading theatre actress. Philip and Magda provided Leonides with three grandchildren, namely Sophia and the precocious younger children Eustace and Josephine. Eustace takes a dislike to Charles and seeks to hamper him where possible whilst Josephine makes clear to Charles that she eavesdrops on everyone around the house, makes notes about their private lives and dislikes most of her family except for Edith and Sophia.
Charles subsequently finds that Leonides' younger son, Roger, the emotionally immature managing director of the family's flagship business, was reliant upon his father bailing out the business numerous times due to his poor management. The fact that Leonides was so willing to bail Roger out did not sit well with either Roger, due to his pride, or his domineering wife Clemency. Charles further finds that Leonides' second wife, Brenda, a much younger former Las Vegas casino dancer, is suspected by the rest of the family as having committed the murder. Evidence seems to back this up due to the facts that Brenda had been having an affair with Laurence Brown, the private tutor for the Leonides children, as well as that she administered the fatal dose of drugs to Leonides and that she stood to inherit the entirety of the Leonides estate due to him not having signed a will, meaning he died intestate and thus his estate passed to her.
Charles's investigations and questions are met with hostility by most of the family whilst Josephine cryptically hints at clues along the way, to Charles's irritation, as he finds her treating the investigation as a game to be tiresome. Events take a new, horrific turn when the ladder to Josephine's treehouse is sabotaged and she falls from the tree, being hospitalised as a result. Charles suspects that this was due to Josephine's habit of spying on the other family members and the killer thus wanting to silence her. In the aftermath, Charles's suspicions are heightened and even extend to Sophia after a new will is discovered in which Leonides had left his estate to her, with some arguing that Sophia hired Charles to investigate the murder due to their personal history, knowing he would never accuse her due to their romantic past.
After those developments, Taverner arrives in person to take charge of the case as he feels Charles' romantic history with Sophia does not make him objective enough to solve it. The discovery of love letters between Brenda and Laurence gives Taverner enough evidence to arrest them for Leonides' murder and the attempt on Josephine, to the delight of most of his family members who had always hated both. Charles, however, remains unconvinced that Brenda and Laurence are guilty, noting Brenda's childlike intelligence and Laurence's pacifist, left-wing views as making them unlikely candidates for being a murderer. Sophia and Edith seem to agree, with Sophia noting how the letters could have been forged and Edith paying for a top rate lawyer to represent Brenda and Laurence in court. In the meantime, however, Charles returns to London and only returns to the estate when Josephine's nanny dies after being poisoned by drinking a mug of hot chocolate that she had made for Josephine.
Charles implores Josephine to tell her who the killer is as he has worked out she knows their identity. Again, Josephine refuses to tell. After it is established that the nanny died of cyanide poisoning, Charles begins to suspect Edith as he knew she had been using cyanide to remove moles in the estate garden. His search of Edith's garden shed finds a bottle of cyanide as well as Josephine's missing notebook, complete with her notes on each member of the family. Edith drives out of the family estate with Josephine, having also left a note for Charles to find. Charles and Sophia take off in pursuit of Edith in a car chase to try and stop them. In the car, Sophia reads the note that Edith had left in which she confesses to the murder but Charles argues that he believes Edith is not the killer.
Sophia reads extracts from Josephine's notebook in which the child admits to murdering Leonides purely because he had refused to pay for her ballet lessons. The notebook further reveals that Josephine had also faked the attack on herself and had poisoned her nanny when the latter began to suspect Josephine. Lady Edith had worked out that Josephine was the killer and planted evidence and wrote the confession note to spare Josephine a life in psychiatric institutions and exonerate Brenda and Laurence. Edith had earlier been informed that she was dying of cancer and so decided to sacrifice herself to protect Josephine and the rest of the family. Edith realises that Charles and Sophia are pursuing her and so she drives her car over the clifftop of a quarry, killing herself and Josephine. The film ends as Charles comforts a shocked Sophia at the edge of the cliff."
Hostiles,"In 1892, settler Wesley Quaid and his family are attacked by a Comanche war group proceeding to kill and scalp him and to shoot his three children. Only his wife Rosalee manages to escape from the attack, hiding in a small rock outcrop in the forest.
In Fort Berringer, New Mexico, Captain Joseph Blocker rounds up an escaping Apache family and brings them back to the fort. He is then called to the office of Colonel Abraham Biggs, who informs him of his final orders before retirement, based on a directive from the President: escort dying Cheyenne war chief Yellow Hawk, along with his family, back to their tribal lands in Montana. Under threat of a court-martial and loss of his pension if he refuses to follow the orders, Blocker reluctantly accepts, despite his own gory history with the chief, who was responsible for the death of several of his friends and comrades. Blocker chooses the detail that will accompany him: his trusty old friend Sergeant Thomas Metz, long-time aide Corporal Woodson, and promising newcomer Lieutenant Kidder, fresh from West Point. Biggs also assigns to the detail a young French-speaking recruit, Private DeJardin.
They begin their journey but Blocker orders a stop and has the two native men put in chains. The group comes across the charred Quaid house and dead settler. Inside the house they find Rosalee and her three ""sleeping"" children. Rosalee is initially hostile towards the Cheyenne family because of the attack on her family but agrees to sleep in their camp after some coaxing from Blocker. She's convinced to bury her family and join Blocker's detail until their next stop-over. They are soon ambushed by the Comanche party, resulting in DeJardin's death and Woodson being seriously wounded. After this attack, Yellow Hawk convinces Blocker that it is in everyone's best interest to unchain him and his family. The next day, the bodies of the surviving Comanche party, who had managed to flee during their previous encounter, are discovered dead. Blocker deduces that Yellow Hawk and his son, Black Hawk, killed them thanks to Metz allowing them to leave the camp during the night.
After a brief stop at Fort Winslow in Colorado to drop off the wounded Woodson and Rosalee, Blocker is instructed to take disgraced Sergeant Charles Wills, who killed a family with an ax, to be court-martialed and hanged at a stop at his original post along the way to Montana. Joining Blocker’s company to oversee Wills are Corporal Tommy Thomas and Sergeant Malloy. Meanwhile, Rosalee decides to continue on with Blocker, despite being offered sanctuary at Fort Winslow until the next supply train at Christmas. One night, the women are abducted and raped by three fur traders as they wash dishes in the stream by their camp. The company, assisted by Yellow Hawk and Black Hawk, manages to track down the fur traders and slaughter them to rescue the women; however, Sergeant Malloy is killed. During a downpour, Wills manages to fool Kidder into sympathetically undoing his chains, only to kill him and escape but not before Blocker shoots him. He is later tracked down by Metz, who then takes his own life, succumbing to decades of PTSD.
Blocker arrives with the dying chief at his tribal lands in Montana where he dies and is buried. The white landowner and his three sons arrive to the place as the chief is buried and threatens Blocker and the rest of the group for burying an Indian on his land. Blocker tells the landowner that the chief is not leaving the land. The confrontation results in a brutal gun battle killing Black Hawk, his wife Elk Woman, his sister Living Woman, and Corporal Tommy Thomas, while leaving alive only Blocker, Rosalee, and Black Hawk's young son, Little Bear. In the final scene, Rosalee and Little Bear reluctantly depart on a train from Montana to Chicago, without Blocker, but, at the last second, Blocker jumps on the back of the train."
All the Money in the World,"In 1973, 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Paul), grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty who was at that time the world's richest private citizen, is kidnapped in Rome by an organized crime ring. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $17 million. Flashbacks show that Paul's parents, Gail Harris and John Paul Getty Jr., were divorced in 1971 due to Getty Jr.'s drug addiction and that Gail rejected any alimony in exchange for full custody of her children in the divorce settlement; therefore she does not have the means to pay the ransom. She travels to Getty's estate to beseech him to pay the ransom but he refuses, stating that it would encourage further kidnappings on his family members. The media picks up on the story, with many believing Gail to be rich herself and blaming her for the refusal to pay the ransom. Meanwhile, Getty asks Fletcher Chace, a Getty Oil negotiator and former CIA operative, to investigate the case and secure Paul's release.
Paul is kept hostage in a remote location in Italy. Initially his captors, particularly Cinquanta, are tolerant with him because his quiet and submissive demeanor causes them few problems. However, things grow increasingly tense as weeks go by without the ransom being paid, far longer than the captors anticipated. Arguments arise over whether to move Paul to a new location as winter is approaching and their hideout is not suitable for cold conditions. Things get worse when one of the kidnappers accidentally shows his face to Paul, prompting one of the others to kill the man for his foolish mistake. His burned and disfigured body is recovered in the river; investigators erroneously identify the body as Paul's, but Gail examines the body and refutes this.
Using the new lead of the body, Chace is able to pinpoint the hideout where Paul is being held. A raid is conducted with several kidnappers being killed, but Paul is no longer there; he had been sold on to a new crime organization. The new captors are much less patient with Paul and negotiate more aggressively with the Getty family to receive their payment. After repeated negotiations with Gail and Chace, and frustration from the captors at how long the process was taking, they lower the asking price to $4 million. Getty finally decides to contribute to the ransom, but only $1 million – this being the maximum amount that he can claim as tax deductible. Moreover, he also will only do so if Gail signs a legal document waiving her parental access rights to Paul and her other children, giving them to Getty's son, her ex-husband. She reluctantly signs them.
The kidnappers cut off one of Paul's ears and mail it to a major newspaper, claiming that they will continue mutilating him until the ransom is paid. Berated by an exasperated Chace, Getty finally relents and agrees to pay the full ransom, also voiding the parental agreement with Gail. Gail and Chace take the money to Italy and follow specific instructions from the captors, leaving the money in a remote location and receiving orders to pick up Paul from a construction site. However, a frightened Paul runs away from the site towards the nearest town, miles away. Meanwhile the captors realize that Chace has broken his word and led the police to them; angry, they decide to find and kill Paul. Chace, Gail, and the captors arrive at the town to look for Paul. One of the kidnappers finds Paul first, but Cinquanta attacks the man in order to allow Paul to escape. Chace and Gail find Paul and smuggle him out of the country to safety.
Getty dies of unrelated causes, and Gail is tasked with managing her children's inherited wealth until they are of age. The company was set up as a charitable trust, which meant that Getty's income was tax-free but also not spendable. He had invested much of it in paintings, sculptures and other artifacts, most of them now reside in the Getty Museum in Los Angeles."
Molly's Game,"Molly Bloom is world-class mogul skier with Olympic aspirations, the result of years of enforced training from her overbearing father. In a qualifying event for the 2002 Winter Olympics, Molly is severely injured, ending her career.
Instead of following her original plan of attending law school, Molly decides to take a year off and move to Los Angeles. Once she arrives, she becomes a bottle-service waitress at a club, where she meets Dean, an ostentatious but unsuccessful real estate developer. She becomes his office manager, and he soon involves her in running his underground poker games. Many famous and wealthy individuals, such as movie stars, investment bankers, and sports players, are involved in Dean's game. Molly earns large sums of money on tips alone.
Molly is initially uninformed on poker topics but quickly learns how to appeal to the players to gain tips. In particular, she hopes to please the most successful player, Player X, by attracting new players to the game. Dean, upon seeing that Molly is becoming increasingly independent in running the games, attempts to control her, and then he fires her. Molly, having gained contacts through years of running the game, decides to create her own poker games. She rents a penthouse at a hotel and hires a staff to help her run games. Additionally, she contacts employees at clubs and casinos to try and spread word about her poker games. Player X, along with many other players, decides to leave Dean's games to play at Molly's game. Molly becomes increasingly successful, gaining more money while being pressured by Player X to raise the stakes for her games. Harlan Eustice, a skilled, conservative, and successful player, joins Molly's game. One night, after accidentally losing a hand to the notorious worst player in Molly's circle, Harlan becomes increasingly compulsive, suffering heavy losses (later, Molly finds out that Player X, who enjoys ruining people's lives more than the game itself, has been funding Harlan to keep him in the game). After Molly berates him for his unethical actions, Player X decides to change venue for his games, and the other players join him, leaving Molly.
Molly moves to New York, with the hope of beginning a new underground poker game. After reaching out to many wealthy New Yorkers, Molly finds enough players for several weekly games. Despite continuous success, she is unable to cover her losses when players cannot pay. Her dealer convinces her to begin taking a percentage of large pots, allowing her to recoup her potential losses but making her game an illegal gambling operation. One of her Los Angeles players is indicted for running a Ponzi scheme; Molly is investigated and questioned as to who attended her games. At this time, Molly becomes increasingly addicted to drugs, as the games have increasingly taken their toll. Her players also begin to include wealthy individuals from the Russian mafia, among others. She is approached by several Italian mafia members who offer their services to extort money from non-paying players. After she declines, she is attacked in her home, where she is held at gunpoint and her mother's life is threatened. As she is about to return to her poker games, the FBI conducts a raid, a result of Douglas Downey, one of her players, acting as an informant. Molly's assets are seized, and she returns home to live with her mother.
Two years later, Molly has moved out and published a book where she names a few individuals that played in her games. She is arrested by the FBI and indicted for involvement in illegal gambling with the mafia. She enlists the help of Charlie Jaffey, a high-profile and expensive lawyer in New York, who agrees to help after he learns that she has been protecting innocent people who were affected by her poker games. While she is in New York awaiting trial, her father, Larry, seeks her out and attempts to reconcile with her. He admits that he was overbearing and that he treated Molly differently than her brothers because she had known about his affairs. Charlie reads Molly's book and becomes interested in helping her case, as he feels she has not committed serious enough wrongdoing to merit a prison term. Charlie negotiates a deal for Molly to receive no sentence and for her money to be returned in exchange for her hard drives and digital records from gambling. Molly declines this deal, fearing that the information about her players would be released, and she pleads guilty. The judge, deciding that she had committed no serious crimes, sentences her to community service, probation, and a $200,000 fine."
Phantom Thread,"In 1954 London, renowned fashion designer Reynolds Woodcock creates dresses for members of high society. His charisma and genius are matched by his obsessive, controlling and sometimes abusive personality. Cyril, his sister, manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and has significant influence over his life. Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes.
After designing a new gown for a revered client, Reynolds visits a restaurant in the countryside and becomes interested in a waitress, Alma. He asks her on a date, and she accepts. Their relationship develops, and she moves in with him, becoming his assistant, muse and lover. Cyril initially distrusts Alma but comes to respect her willfulness and determination.
At first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds' work, but he proves aloof and hard to please, and they bicker. When Alma tries to surprise him with a romantic dinner, Reynolds lashes out and they fight. Alma wonders aloud what she is doing in his house beyond either waiting for him to pay attention to her or ask her to leave.
In order to regain her power in their relationship and to punish and make Reynolds more vulnerable and needy, Alma laces his tea with a small amount of poisonous mushroom gathered outside his country house. The next morning, dizzy and sweating, while he readies a wedding gown for a Belgian princess, he collapses, damaging the dress and forcing his staff to work all night to repair it. He becomes gravely ill and sees his mother in the room; he tells her how much he misses her. Alma nurses him through his fever; when Cyril brings in a doctor, first Reynolds and then Alma tell the doctor to ""Fuck off."" When Reynolds is well again, he asks Alma to marry him, telling her that there are things that he must do and he cannot do them without her. Alma accepts and they are married.
On vacation in the Swiss Alps, once again, Reynolds starts saying cruel and cutting things to Alma both privately and in front of their friends; they fight and defy each other again. As Reynolds' anxiety about his work increases, he complains to Cyril about Alma, who enters the room and overhears the conversation; neither Reynolds nor Alma is perturbed. We see Alma in the forest again, gathering mushrooms. One evening, she prepares a poisoned omelette as Reynolds watches her from the dining room table. As he slowly chews his first bite, she informs him that she wants him weak and vulnerable with only her to take care of him; after that, she wants him strong again. Reynolds implicitly consents by swallowing one bite of the omelette, responding, ""Kiss me, my girl, before I'm sick."" In the next scene, they are in Reynolds' bedroom: Alma sits with Reynolds, in pajamas with a pan in his lap; they smile happily and kiss before he tells her that it's time for her to leave the room to which she responds, ""I'll be right outside the door.""
Later in a voiceover, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and her running the dressmaking business as a partner. We see Alma pushing a baby carriage which she hands over to Cyril so that she and Reynolds can go out. In the present moment, we see Reynolds with his head in Alma's lap as they enjoy the fireplace; Reynolds remarks that he is getting hungry."
 Arrowhead,"While escaping a political prison on a mining colony, Kye Cortland is forced to amputate his foot to save himself and the other prisoners from being torn apart by the mining machinery. Cortland is recruited to join the rebellion against General Lang, who won a civil war against General Hatch. Hatch explains to Cortland that his father, an important figure to the rebellion, is scheduled to be executed in several months on the anniversary of Lang's victory. Hatch wants Cortland, an accomplished pilot, to hijack a scientific vessel, retrieve its data, and use it to help Hatch free Cortland's father. Cortland receives a cybernetic foot and agrees.
Onboard the Arrowhead, Cortland wakes from suspended animation early and hacks into the vessel's data banks. He is concerned when this appears to lower the ship's defenses, but Hatch remotely assures him that it will be temporary and perfectly safe. A dangerous EMI flare-up prevents Cortland from sending the data to Hatch and damages the ship, forcing it to eject all the escape pods. Cortland escapes in a shuttle, landing near the escape pods on a desert moon. The ship's AI, RE3F, warns him of a toxic atmosphere but refuses to give further data without a valid login.
Exploring, Cortland finds the body of Arrowhead's security chief, Norman Oleander, and an intact pod with biologist Tarren Hollis. Cortland brings Hollis back to the shuttle and, after reviving her, uses her biometric data to activate RE3F. Hollis surmises Cortland is working for Hatch, who she says has been engaging in terrorist attacks; Cortland dismisses her accusations as propaganda. Hollis, who recognises Cortland as a soldier who served with her father, offers him a fair trial if he accompanies her to a rendezvous point where survivors will be rescued. Cortland declines.
Cortland rejoins her when RE3F refuses to start the shuttle's engines with Hollis' login. On the way, a hostile insectoid creature attacks and apparently kills Cortland, causing Hollis to miss the rescue. A nearby obelisk resurrects Cortland, infecting him with a symbiote and healing all his wounds, including his foot. Hollis and Cortland drag Oleander's body to the same obelisk, resurrecting him and using his biometric data to unlock all of RE3F's functions. Hollis convinces Cortland not to leave Oleander behind. However, when Oleander revives, he begins ranting and turns hostile. After Oleander shoots Hollis, Cortland kills him and collapses from his own wounds.
When Cortland revives, RE3F tells him he was dead for thirty-four days. The symbiote has again revived him, but Hollis is gone, apparently dead. With RE3F's help, Cortland works to restore the shuttle's power and escape the moon in time to rescue his father. Cortland discovers his symbiote causes him to transform into the insectoid creature during periods of intense stress or pain. After suffering an uncontrolled transformation, Cortland misses the anniversary. Resigned, Cortland spends the next three years bonding with RE3F, learning to control his transformation, and surviving on the moon.
RE3F cannot volunteer information and must be asked questions. After a chance comment, Cortland learns from RE3F that Hollis survived the fight and possibly escaped the moon. Cortland is frustrated RE3F unwillingly withheld the information but scavenges parts from the shuttle to upgrade RE3F, giving it a mobile frame. Grateful, RE3F illegally grants Cortland access to confidential information, revealing that the moon is the subject of a relativistic time dilation experiment. Hatch and Lang want to use the planet offensively against each other's forces.
Hatch lands on the moon, explaining that 20 minutes have passed from his point of reference. He has captured Hollis and threatens to kill her unless Cortland hands over the scientific data. Realizing Hatch, who admits to mass murder in pursuit of his goal, never intended him to survive, Cortland refuses. Cortland wounds Hatch with a grenade initially embedded in his cybernetic foot, then kills him by transforming. Hollis talks him down and helps him transform back to a human. The two plan to leave the moon and not only free Cortland's father but everyone else, too."
 Backtrack,"Troubled psychotherapist Peter Bower suffers from nightmares and eerie visions ever since the death of his daughter Evie in a street accident a year earlier, which he blames himself for after he was briefly distracted by something in a store window and failed to notice her veer off the sidewalk. His wife Carol suffers extreme depression and rarely gets out of bed while he works in his practice, meeting some clients referred to him by his mentor, Duncan. One client, Felix, apparently suffers from anterograde amnesia, believing that it is still the 80s; another, Erica, talks of her suicidal thoughts, but finds herself unable to commit suicide; and another, Elizabeth Valentine, is a girl who is apparently mute and who reacts with fear to the sound of the train passing by Peter's office, and before she flees, she writes a series of numbers on one of Peter's notepads: 12787.
Elizabeth returns unexpectedly, and Peter finds her looking out of his window to where the train will pass. Again, she is disturbed by the sound of it and begins to choke; she hits the window, leaving a handprint. Peter records her, but she disappears before he can speak to her further. He plays the recording to Duncan, who claims he hears nothing and believes that Peter is hallucinating Elizabeth out of guilt from failing to prevent his daughter's death, pointing out that her initials sound like Evie's name. Later, Peter hallucinates Elizabeth saying that ""we have her"" before turning into Evie and then vanishing, and later, he has a nightmare about Erica, who says she wasn't able to commit suicide because she's already dead. Doing research, Peter discovers that Elizabeth died in 1987, along with all the other clients who had been seeing him. The numbers that Elizabeth wrote on his notepad was a date: July 12, 1987. Perplexed, he calls Duncan and asks to speak with him later, and then has a vision of his deceased patients on the train outside of his window.
Duncan comes over, and Peter worries about his sanity and questions how Duncan could have referred the patients when all of them have been deceased for decades. He then notices that Duncan doesn't appear in a mirror, and he, too, is a ghost. Now fully disturbed, Peter uses a map to discover that all the deceased patients lived along a train line leading to his hometown, False Creek. He travels there alone and meets with his father, William, a retired cop. Going to the bar, Peter meets with a childhood friend, Barry, and tells him that there is a weight on his conscience that he wants lifted. Barry alludes to a horrifying event that happened in their youth that they promised to keep a secret, and tells Peter to leave him out of any confession.
When the two were teenagers, Barry led Peter to a secret location that his brother mentioned, where couples would apparently have sex in their cars. The two left their bikes at the side of the train tracks and went to go spy on a couple in a car. Peter panics when he hears a train whistle, and he raced to move their bikes; in the process, he saw what he thought was Barry, running ahead of him. However, neither got there in time, and the train was violently derailed, killing 47 of the passengers on board. Peter saw several of the victims, all of whom would be his deceased future clients. He is then terrorized by the ghosts of Evie, Felix, and Elizabeth.
The next morning, Barry drives to the train tracks, and Peter goes to the police station. There, he meets Barbara, a constable, and confesses the incident to her. She tells him that he will likely face no charges, as it was an accident that happened when he was a teenager, and the statute of limitations has expired. Peter also discovers that she was the daughter of Erica. He apologizes, and Barbara tells him that her mother was the only local killed in the accident, and that William was kind to her at the funeral, inspiring her to become a police officer.
Barbara investigates the accident while Peter tries and fails to burn his newspaper clipping of the accident. He is drawn to a closet, where the ghost of Elizabeth briefly strangles him. Duncan then appears, telling him that there was no way that bicycles lying against the tracks would have derailed the train, and that there was more to the accident. He also urges Peter to remember exactly what distracted him on the day of Evie's death. Peter recalls looking into a toy shop window at a railroad set, specifically, a model of a switch tower. The next morning, he investigates the switch tower beside the tracks and finds Barry, who has committed suicide, inside. When the police arrive, Peter confesses to Barbara that Barry was there the night of the accident, but he intentionally left him out of the confession. Later, he tells her about his hallucinations since Evie's death. When she does not believe him, he tells her details about Erica that he wouldn't otherwise know. Rattled, she orders him to leave.
A police officer finds an old and encrusted pin lying on the floor of the switch house and gives it to Barbara, who discovers that it's the insignia of Elizabeth's high school. As Peter once more returns to the scene of the accident, she pays a visit to William and tells him that during her investigation, she has discovered that the road he apparently drove to get to the aftermath of the crash was blocked off, and he would have only been able to drive there if his car had already been near the tracks. Furthermore, Elizabeth was the only victim with a cause of death that the coroners deemed inconclusive. Meanwhile, Peter sees Elizabeth's ghost once more, and, taking the same path he did as the night of the accident, he realizes that it was not Barry he saw running ahead of him, but Elizabeth. Going up to the switch house, he suddenly remembers all of the night: he looked through the windows of the house to see his father strangling Elizabeth. In her struggle to survive, she left a handprint on the window (the same one he saw earlier), and she also accidentally pulled the levers of the train tracks, leading it to derail and kill the passengers. Afterwards, William placed her body at the scene of the crash.
Barbara asserts to William that she knows Elizabeth was not a victim of the crash, and she believes that Peter saw something that night that William wanted covered up. William knocks her unconscious and puts her in the trunk of his car. Peter returns and tells William that he knows the truth: the couple that Peter and Barry saw in the car was really William raping Elizabeth, and he saw William kill her; he asks William if Elizabeth was his only victim. William pulls a gun on him and tells him to get in the garage. Inside, Peter hears Barbara regain consciousness, and after a brief struggle, William knocks him unconscious as well.
The next morning, William drives out with both Peter and Barbara restrained in the car. A gun is on the passenger seat. However, the ghost of Elizabeth appears in the road and in the car, startling William and making him lose control of the car. In the process, Peter is thrown out of the backseat of the car and ends up a safe distance away, with the gun. William ends up on the train tracks, the engine dead and the doors locked as a train begins to approach. He tries and fails to escape and yells to Peter for help. Peter attempts to shoot out a window so William can escape, but only succeeds when the train is extremely close. The trunk opens and Barbara manages to climb out, and Peter pushes her off the tracks to safety. William, held back by Elizabeth's ghost, is crushed by the train. As Peter and Barbara stand on the side of the tracks, Peter can see the ghosts of the victims on the train, and sees a tranquil Elizabeth turn and depart.
Later, Peter is on the beach with the ghost of Evie, who gets up and walks into the ocean, finally moving on and at peace. His wife joins him and asks what he's thinking about; Peter tells her that he's thinking about kids. Carol smiles, and they embrace."

 Downriver,"James is a young man who suffers from epilepsy and has recently been granted parole from the juvenile detention centre in which he has spent the last eight years. When he was ten, he drowned a little boy, Chris McCarthy, in a river at a caravan park, although the body was never found. After being released, he returns to the caravan park in order to find and return the body to the grieving mother. He moves into the old cabin he used to live in with his mother and befriends Damien, the boy next door. James tells Damien that Chris had been his brother. He is eventually joined at the park by his mother Paige and her new boyfriend, Wayne. Paige tells Wayne that James is her nephew and that her son died.
Despite the fact that his family took out a restraining order against James, James is approached by his former friend Anthony. Anthony was with him when he killed Chris and gave evidence that convicted James, leading to animosity between them. Anthony has turned into a lazy, drug-addicted hustler. He tries to dissuade James from looking for the body, reasoning that the local wild dogs probably took it. James refuses and in retaliation, Anthony seduces Damien.
James and Damien visit Mary, a local woman who keeps several dogs, to ask her about the possibility of the wild dogs taking the body. She dismisses the idea and mentions that Anthony and another boy, Ray, killed one of her dogs a few years back. Wracked with guilt, Ray came to her to confess. James then visits Ray and asks him about the dog they killed. Ray admits that he and Anthony were playing in the tunnels under the bridge with the dog until Anthony tricked the dog into jumping into a hole from which it couldn't escape. This gives James the idea that Anthony hid Chris's body in the tunnels under the bridge.
James discusses his search with Paige. She reveals that after the drowning, James had an epileptic fit and Anthony got him help, not leaving his side until many hours later. This leads James to realise that Anthony could not have hidden the body.
James organises a fishing trip with Damien's family and Wayne near the bridge. He sneaks off and explores the tunnels. Though he finds the hole Ray mentioned, it is filled with water and he is unable to search it further. When he returns to the others, Damien reveals that Chris didn't have any brothers and guesses that James was his killer. He tells him to stay away from his family. The stress causes James to have a fit in the water and he nearly drowns. When they return to the park, Wayne reveals to Paige that he knows James is her son.
Finally James visits Amos, who owns the local shop and has been blackmailed by Anthony for many years. Amos reveals that Anthony and his brother Joe once had a younger sister, Bettina, who suddenly disappeared one day and the family never spoke of her again.
In the meantime, Damien goes to Anthony's house. Anthony is away so he talks to his father Gianni. His attempts at conversation, relating a story Anthony told him about a drowned baby, raise Gianni's suspicions. Gianni knocks Damien unconscious and Joe drives him away in the car. When Anthony returns home later, Gianni beats him and questions him about what he has been saying about his sister, someone Anthony clearly doesn't remember.
James returns home to Paige and tearfully reveals what happened the day of the drowning. Anthony, with vague recollections of Bettina, had asked James to 'steal him a sister'. They had selected Chris, lured him away from his family, and played with him on the riverbank until Anthony started abusing Chris and pressured James to drown the boy before they got in trouble for their 'theft'. Paige then remembers that although Anthony was there all evening, he did speak to Joe, giving Joe an opportunity to move the body.
Joe and Anthony then arrive and attempt to blackmail James into abandoning his search by beating Damien. This makes James even more determined to bring the family to justice. James and Damien escape to Mary's house, where they reconcile.
The next morning, James returns to the tunnels under the bridge with Damien and Mary, along with ropes and torches. James climbs down into the water filled hole and eventually finds Chris's body, along with an even more decomposed body of a little girl, presumably Bettina.[7]"
 Emo the Musical,"Ethan is an Emo who has just been expelled from his private-school after attempting suicide in the courtyard.

 Hacksaw Ridge,"As a child, Desmond Doss nearly kills his younger brother Hal. This event and his Seventh-day Adventist upbringing reinforce Desmond's belief in the commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"". Years later, Doss takes an injured man to the hospital and meets a nurse, Dorothy Schutte. The two strike a romance and Doss tells Dorothy of his interest in medical work.
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Doss enlists in the Army to serve as a combat medic. His father Tom, a World War I veteran, is deeply upset by the decision. Before leaving for Fort Jackson, he asks for Dorothy's hand in marriage and she accepts.
Doss is placed under the command of Sergeant Howell. He excels physically but becomes an outcast among his fellow soldiers for refusing to handle a rifle and train on Saturdays. Howell and Captain Glover attempt to discharge Doss for psychiatric reasons but are overruled, as Doss' religious beliefs do not constitute mental illness. They subsequently torment Doss by putting him through grueling labor, intending to get Doss to leave of his own accord. Despite being beaten one night by his fellow soldiers, he refuses to identify his attackers and continues training.
Doss' unit completes basic training and is released on leave, during which Doss intends to marry Dorothy, but his refusal to carry a firearm leads to an arrest for insubordination. Captain Glover and Dorothy visit Doss in jail and try to convince him to plead guilty so that he can be released without charge, but Doss refuses to compromise his beliefs. At his trial Doss pleads not guilty, but before he is sentenced, his father barges into the tribunal with a letter from a former commanding officer stating that his son's pacifism is protected by an Act of Congress. The charges against Doss are dropped, and he and Dorothy are married.
Doss' unit is assigned to the 77th Infantry Division and deployed to the Pacific theater. During the Battle of Okinawa, Doss' unit is informed that they are to relieve the 96th Infantry Division, which was tasked with ascending and securing the Maeda Escarpment (""Hacksaw Ridge""). In the initial fight, both sides sustain heavy losses. Doss saves his squadmate Smitty as well as several wounded soldiers. The Americans camp for the night, which Doss spends in a foxhole with Smitty. Doss reveals that his aversion to holding a firearm stems from nearly shooting his drunken father, who threatened his mother with a gun. Smitty apologizes for doubting his courage, and the two reconcile.
The next morning, the Japanese launch a massive counterattack and drive the Americans off the escarpment. Smitty is killed, while Howell and several of Doss' squad mates are left injured on the battlefield. Doss hears the cries of dying soldiers and returns to save them, carrying the wounded to the cliff's edge and belaying them down by rope, each time praying to save one more. The arrival of dozens of wounded once presumed dead comes as a shock to the rest of the unit below. When day breaks, Doss rescues Howell and the two escape Hacksaw under enemy fire.
Captain Glover tells Doss that the men have been inspired by his selflessness, and that they will not launch the next attack without him. With reinforcements, they turn the tide of battle. After an ambush set by Japanese soldiers feigning surrender, Doss manages to save Glover and others by deflecting enemy grenades. Doss is eventually wounded by a grenade blast, but the battle is won. Doss descends the cliff, clutching the Bible Dorothy gave him.
The film switches to archival photos and footage showing that Doss was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Harry S. Truman for rescuing 75 soldiers at Hacksaw Ridge. Doss stayed married to Dorothy until her death in 1991. He died on March 23, 2006, at the age of 87."

One day, Saroo follows his brother to a job and they arrive at a nearby train station, where Saroo decides to stay back and take a nap. Guddu tries to wake him up, but Saroo is too tired. When Guddu does not return, Saroo searches for him and boards a train presuming Guddu is aboard. He falls asleep again in one of the compartments, and wakes up to find the train in motion. After several days, it arrives in faraway Calcutta, where he does not understand the local Bengali language. He stands at a ticket counter and tries to obtain a ticket home, but the attendant does not recognise the name of his village, which Saroo says is ""Ginestalay"".[4] He spends the night in the station with some streetchildren, but is then woken up and forced to run when a group of men try to kidnap them.
Saroo continues to wander around the city before coming across Noor, a seemingly friendly woman who brings him back to her apartment. She tells Saroo that a man named Rama will help him find his way home. Saroo runs away, sensing that Noor and Rama have sinister intentions, and escapes Noor when she chases after him.

She begins to teach Saroo English and he moves to Hobart, Tasmania in 1987, under the care of Sue and John Brierley, where he slowly starts to settle in. A year later, they adopt another boy, Mantosh, who has trouble adjusting to his new home and suffers from rage and self-harm.

He confides that he is adopted, and his friends suggest he use Google Earth to search for his hometown in India. Saroo begins his search, but over time disconnects from Lucy, overwhelmed by the thought of emotions his family must have gone through when he was missing.
Saroo visits Sue, whose health is deteriorating, and learns that she is not infertile, but had chosen to help others in need through adoption, believing that there were already too many people on Earth. Saroo spends a long time searching fruitlessly for his hometown. One evening, while scanning Google Earth, he notices the rock formations where his mother worked, and then finds the area where he lived: the Ganesh Talai neighbourhood of the Khandwa district. He finally tells his adoptive mother about his search, and she fully supports his efforts.
Saroo returns to his hometown, and with the help of a local English speaker, has an emotional reunion with his biological mother and sister. He also learns that Guddu is dead, killed by a train the same night that they were separated at the station as children. Saroo's mother never gave up hope and believed that one day her missing son would return, and never moved away from the village. The film ends with captions about the real Saroo's return to India in February 2012. Photos of the real Australian family are shown, as well as footage of Saroo introducing Sue to his biological mother in India, who deeply appreciates Sue's care for her son. Saroo later learned that he had been mispronouncing his own name, which was actually Sheru, meaning ""lion""."

She whispers to the boy to go to the police, but he does not understand English and is afraid of her. After the boy's mother appears, Andi takes Clare home. She eventually breaks into a locked room within the apartment and finds a photo book filled with Polaroids of what looks to be the blonde Natalie, who was presumably kidnapped and murdered before her.
A man with a flashlight sees Clare in one of the unboarded windows and attempts to rescue her as she cries for help. Andi comes home just then and viciously kills the man. He then forces Clare to help wrap the body in plastic, telling her it's her fault. He takes the body outside and burns it. More time passes as Clare is held prisoner. Andi sees a column in the newspaper about Clare being searched as a missing person and decides to kill her. He tells her to pack her things into a backpack under the pretense that he is having the flat fumigated. Seeing a stack of workbooks that Andi is grading, Clare intentionally burns her hand on the stove and steals one of them when Andi goes to get her ointment. Later, Andi leaves for the final time, turning the power and water off as he goes.
At work, Andi hands out his students' workbooks, including Franka's. Inside hers, Franka discovers a Polaroid of a bound Clare that she had hidden for the girl to find. As Franka leaves the classroom in shock, the Polaroid falls to the floor and is discovered and passed around by the other students. Andi quickly realises that he has been exposed and leaves in a panic, speeding back to his house. Franka rides her bike to the apartment and finds Clare just before Andi arrives. In hiding, Clare is finally able to trap Andi in the part of the house where he had kept her. She is seen later riding in a taxicab, putting back on a necklace her mother had given her that Andi had stolen. The film ends with Clare crying happily as she lets her face feel the fresh air from the car window, finally free."

 Jasper Jones,"Protagonist Charlie Bucktin is a 14-year-old boy living in the fictitious rural town of Corrigan in Western Australia. Charlie spends his days with his best friend Jeffrey Lu, a Vietnamese boy who shares Charlie's love of intellectual banter, and deals stoically with the constant race-hate inflicted on him and his family. Eliza Wishart, a local girl, and daughter of the President of the town hall becomes more and more endeared towards Charlie.
On Christmas evening Charlie is unexpectedly visited by Jasper Jones, an outcast in Corrigan due to his mixed White-Aboriginal heritage and rebellious lifestyle. Jasper begs for Charlie's help, and leads him to his private glade in the bush. Here Charlie is horrified to find the dead body of a young girl, Jasper's girlfriend Laura Wishart, battered and hanging from a tree. Jasper, aware that he is likely to be blamed for Laura's murder, convinces Charlie that they should hide the body, so they throw it into a nearby pond, weighted by a large rock.
Jeffrey is passionate about cricket, but his attempts to join the Corrigan team are thwarted by the racism of the coach and other players. Eventually fortune goes his way, and he finds himself batting in a game against a rival town, watched by Charlie, who has befriended Eliza, Laura Wishart's younger sister. As Jeffrey wins the game on the last ball, Charlie and Eliza hold hands and embrace.

Jasper believes that Laura's murderer is Mad Jack Lionel, a reclusive old man who is rumored to have done terrible things in the past. Jasper determines to confront Lionel on New Year's Eve, and together with Charlie, goes to his house. Lionel manages to defuse Jasper's aggression, and the truth comes out: Lionel is actually Jasper's grandfather who had ostracised his son's family knowing that he had married with an Aboriginal woman when Jasper was a baby. His daughter-in-law then took care of him, spurring a change of heart towards her. One night, she needed medical attention, and Lionel had attempted to race her to hospital. In his haste, however, he accidentally crashed his car, causing her death. The incident has left him guilty, broken, and ostracized by the townspeople. Ever since, Lionel has been trying to reach out to Jasper and apologise for his actions.

The note said that after rampant sexual abuse by her abusive father, leaving Laura pregnant, and after a particularly violent fight on Christmas day, Laura came looking for Jasper. Eliza followed her to the glade. Finding Jasper away, in despair Laura hanged herself, and Eliza, paralyzed by fear, could not save her. Charlie then confesses that he and Jasper had thrown Laura's body into the pond.
Charlie's mother leaves Corrigan. Charlie remains close to Eliza, who exacts revenge on her father by setting fire to their house, injuring him. The secret about Laura's death remains with the three of them."

During conversation Karl claims the existence of a Indian tribe in the jungle that they should go see. Karl says everything will be okay because he knows the jungle and he's friends with the tribe. Yossi, excited about the prospect of exploring the jungle, chooses to believe him. He heads back to the apartment to convince Marcus and Kevin to come along. Being skeptical of the stranger and his story, they refuse. Yossi continues to press them and they ultimately acquiesce.

 Killing Ground,"Ian Smith and Samantha ""Sam"" Shaw are a couple taking a romantic trip for New Year's Eve in the outback. They head to a remote beach for a weekend getaway from the pressures of city life. On the way, they meet German, a man who advises them to set up camp at a beach near a waterfall. When they arrive, they set up camp next to an abandoned campsite with no trace of its occupants. Sam suggests to Ian that they should get married and Ian happily agrees.
After a few nights, they become concerned when they discover a traumatized baby on his own. Elsewhere, German tells his associate, Chook, about Ian and Sam, and the two begin to make plans. Chook is so excited to ""go hunting"" that he leaves early that morning without German. Chook finds Ian and Sam with the baby, Ollie, stuck at the campsite with a flat tire.
Three days earlier, the Baker family - Robert, Margaret, their 16-year-old daughter Emily and their infant son, Ollie - had been camping at the same place. German and Chook showed up at the campsite and kidnapped Robert, Margaret, and Emily, unaware of Ollie’s presence. German and Chook raped Margaret and Emily, and torture the family before murdering them all. After spotting Ollie in a photo on Emily's cell phone, they returned to search for him, but he had wandered off.
Back to the present, Chook persuades Ian to go and search for the missing family. However, he intends to take Ian up to the killing ground to taunt him with the corpses as part of his sick game. When they arrive, the pair discovers that Margaret didn't die from her injuries and crawled off to the creek. Ian tries to save her, but Chook shoots and kills her on the spot. As Chook explains his intent to rape Sam and kill him, Ian charges forward and knocks him down. But rather than fighting Chook, Ian runs off in a panic as Chook chases him.
Meanwhile, German arrives at the campsite to find Sam alone with Ollie. German tries to abduct Sam from the car, but she slashes his wrist and escapes with Ollie into the woods. German releases his dog, Banjo, to attack them. However, Banjo gets distracted by a wild boar and leaves German to chase after them instead.
Chook mistakenly shoots German, thinking he is Ian. Chook apologizes to German as Ian watches from a hiding spot. Nearby, Ollie begins to cry, giving away Sam and Ollie’s location. Ian attempts to retrieve German's sniper rifle, but he is too afraid and returns to his hiding spot. Chook kills German, who begs him to end his suffering. Chook snatches Ollie from Sam before slamming him to the ground. Chook then takes Sam hostage and tells Ian he will be waiting at the killing ground.
After Chook leaves with Sam, Ian stops hiding and notices German's car keys protruding from his pocket. Meanwhile, Chook grows impatient that Ian hasn't come to save Sam, so he threatens to rape her. Right then, he hears Ian escaping in German's truck. Chook angrily drags Sam off with him as they attempt to intercept Ian. When they pass German's corpse, Sam notices that Ollie is missing. Once inside Chook's car, he insults Ian for abandoning Sam, but Sam believes that Ian took Ollie with him. Sam tries to fight Chook, leading to him crashing into a tree, knocking them both unconscious.
As night falls, Ian arrives at the police station and asks for help. He accompanies two officers to the campsite. Sam awakens in the wreck of the car with her hands tied to the steering wheel and Chook absent. The officers spot the wreckage when Sam flashes the head beams on the car, but Chook kills them as they exit their police car. Chook shoots Ian in the arm and holds him hostage. He demands that Sam drive him to a safe location. Sam complies and runs up to save Ian from bleeding to death.
Sam asks Ian if Ollie survived, but Ian tells her that Ollie was never with him and he ran off to the police as he didn't know what to do. Ollie is shown to have crawled away from German's corpse as Banjo sits silently guarding him. His final fate remains unknown.
While driving out of the campsite, Sam resolves to stop Chook and violently crashes the vehicle. Ian falls unconscious, and Chook - badly injured - manages to get away from the wreckage. Sam scuffles with Chook for his handgun before she smashes his head with a large rock, finally killing him.
In the end, Sam wakes up in a hospital and leaves her room to find Ian, recovering from his broken arm in another room. Sam stands silently beside his bed."

 2:22,"The movie starts with Dylan Branson (Michiel Huisman) having a dream about a murder at the Grand Central Train Station that feels very real. He wakes with a start and progresses with his routine while watching news about a star called Hamlin that died 30 years ago, but its light is reaching the Earth 30 years later and that this supernova will have effects on the Earth and its inhabitants. Dylan is an air traffic controller who possess a unique ability to visualize patterns.
Dylan is shown on his way to work, riding a bike and heading to the Grand Central Station to take the train. After work, he goes to a club drinking with his co-workers and receives a ticket to an aerial ballet as a gift for his upcoming birthday. The following day at exactly 2:22pm, his world stops after he almost causes a midair collision of the two aircraft, resulting in him being suspended from his job.
The day after he was suspended, he attends the aerial ballet and meets Sarah (Teresa Palmer). They go to a restaurant and start talking, Dylan tells Sarah that his father was a pilot and that he also trained to be a pilot but could never become one as he was afraid of flying. Sarah tells him that she works at the Howard Pace Art Gallery. He also tells her about his being suspended from work, and he finds out that Sarah was on the plane that almost collided with the other aircraft at 2.22pm. Dylan felt apologetic about the incident, but Sarah was instead thankful towards Dylan for saving her life. As they depart, they admit to each other that for a ""first date"" they felt a deep connection and it felt like they had known each other forever.
The following day, while on the way to the Grand Central Dylan, notices the same happenings (siren, woman laugh, construction sound, ""Can I help you with"", glass breaking) and at 2:21 PM, he hears the announcement of the boarding of the Millhurst express, sees a businessman reading his newspaper, a couple hugging each other, a line of preschoolers where the last child in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clock. At exactly 2:22 PM, the window of the station shatters. He goes to meet Sarah and asks her out to an early dinner, going to the Central Park with her. Sarah tells Dylan that she was a ballet dancer student before she landed awkwardly and tore two of her knee ligaments. Cheering her up, Dylan create an improvised speaker using a paper cup and ice cream cone holder, lifting Sarah's mood,they then dance and kiss. They go to Dylan's apartment and make love. The next morning, Dylan asks Sarah where she got her necklace from, to which Sarah replies that it was from her ex-boyfriend; Jonas (Sam Reid) who happens to be the main artist of the gallery at which she works. Dylan asks when is Sarah's birthday and they find out that both of them were born on the same day; April 18, 1986 and they are both turning 30 within a weeks time. Dylan suddenly hears a car crash on the road below his apartment at exactly 9:15 AM and he tells Sarah that it was 3rd day in a row that the same incident had happened.
Dylan takes a cab with a reckless driver going to Grand Central, as the driver take the shorter route Dylan tells him to stop the cab and notices again the same pattern of siren, a woman laugh, construction sounds, and a man saying ""Can I help you with"". Dylan then shouts for the cab to stop and this infuriates the cab driver, who turns around to tell Dylan off for shouting at him. Just then, another car hits them both, causing the breaking of the cab's glass windows. Even though Dylan is injured, he goes to the Grand Central Station and sees exactly the same pattern of events. He tells Sarah of these repeating patterns, but with different people carrying out the same actions. Sarah does not believe Dylan, but helps to clean his wounds from the car accident. Dylan goes home and starts writing all the events of his day starting from 9:10 AM (water drop, a bug dying, a plane flying overhead etc.) and realizes that everything has a pattern that's repeating itself.
Dylan goes to the gallery looking for Sarah, and realises that the gallery was having an exhibition with Jonas' art piece as the main exhibition. Jonas has created a light hologram exhibition about the Grand Central Station, and Dylan sees that it is exactly like the events that he has experienced the past few days (announcement of the boarding of Millhurst Express, a business man reading his newspaper, a couple embracing each other, a line of preschooler where the last in line drops something and a pregnant woman under the clocks). Dylan assumes that Jonas is stalking him as only Dylan knows about these events.He attacks Jonas resulting in a brawl and questions Jonas on whether he was stalking him. In the audience is the owner of the Keifer Gallery and he applauds saying it was a great idea to enact the murder at the Grand Central Station that happened 30 years ago and that he has an exhibit related to it at his gallery. Sarah apologises to Jonas about Dylan's attack and puts her relationship with Dylan on hold.
Later that night, Dylan texts Sarah to beg for her forgiveness. In the mean time, he finds a stack of envelope hidden in his home. He finds out Jake Redman (Duncan Ragg) has written these letters to a woman named Evelyn. Upon investigation, Dylan finds out that Jake was a criminal although he was never convicted for his crimes as the police could not find enough evidence to pin him down, while Evelyn was a singer, and they both were lovers. Dylan also finds an article online stating that Jack had shot Evelyn and another policeman, Noah (Jack Ellis), down in the Grand Central Station in a fit of jealous rage before being gunned down by other policemen on 18 April 1986, which was the day both Dylan and Sarah were born.
Dylan then visits Evelyn's sister, and she gives Dylan a stack of letters that Jack wrote to Evelyn as she could never bear to read them and shows him the necklace she is wearing saying that it was all she needs to remember her. The necklace is identical to the one that Dylan had seen Sarah wear. She also tells him that Noah; the policeman was taking Evelyn to Millhurst to keep her safe from Jake and that it seemed that he was also in love with Evelyn. Noah goes to the Grand Central Station to buy a ticket for the Millhurst Express, but is told that the service was terminated 30 years ago and now the train is known as the Poughkeepsie Express. At exactly 2:22 PM the chandelier crashes to the floor.
Dylan connects the dots and realises that Dylan was Jake in his past life, while Sarah was Evelyn, and that he would kill her at Grand Central Station on their birthday, 18 April at 2:22 PM. He realises that the pattern of events that has been happening was leading up to the day they both would die. He tells Sarah this and she does not believe him. As she tries to calm Dylan down, Dylan insists that they both should break up as he would soon kill Sarah, which he does not want to as he knows that they are soul mates.
Dylan contemplates suicide, which was unsuccessful, while a distraught Sarah looks for Jonas in his apartment. Jonas offers to bring Sarah to Millhurst to help her feel better about the breakup. The next day, both Jonas and Sarah's flight to Millhurst gets canceled and they have to go to Grand Central Station to take a train there. Meanwhile, Dylan looks for Sarah and in the midst of it, he breaks into Jonas' apartment and sees that Jonas recognises Sarah as Evelyn in his past life and that he was Noah. Dylan figures out that Jonas/Noah is obsessed with Sarah/Evelyn and that Jonas/Noah had a gun with him and races to the Grand Central Station to see her. On his way he attracts the attention of the police and leads them there.
At the Grand Central Station, Sarah realises that the patterns Dylan saw were true and she tries to leave but is stopped by a crazed Jonas calling her Evelyn. He wants Sarah to admit that she loves him, while Sarah refuses just as Dylan arrives at the Station. Jonas thinking that Sarah called him there gets enraged and makes his way towards Dylan with a gun while Sarah sees the events unfold as Dylan had described them to her, and realises that she is the pregnant woman standing under the clock.Jonas first points his gun towards Dylan and then Sarah saying that ""she'll never be yours"" intending to kill her so that if he couldn't have her neither could Dylan but Dylan shields Sarah just in time but himself gets shot at 2:21 PM.
The events from 30 years ago plays out with Jake/Dylan protecting Sarah/Evelyn from Noah/Jonas and at exactly 2:22 PM Jonas gets shot by the police who have followed Dylan there. Dylan also falls in Evelyn's arms and momentarily closes his eyes having visions of Jake and Evelyn being affectionate. He does not die and Sarah then looks at the clock, saying it was 2:23 PM and they managed to survive. Turns out that the Jake was framed for murdering Noah and Evelyn as the police had wanted to save the reputation of Noah since he was a Police detective and one of them. Also the dying star; Hamlin mentioned at the start of the movie finally disappears but a new star is immediately reborn.
In the ending scene, it is shown that Dylan and Sarah are living happily, with Dylan having finally overcome his fear of flying and is now a pilot and Sarah smiling affectionately at their baby in the cradle."

Set the Thames on Fire,"Art is a down-on-his-luck lowlife pianist, whose life has stalled in a grief filled frozen moment – shipwrecked on the lonesome shore of his own life. Sal is a cracked pinball machine; full of energy, light and fun but out of control and dangerously chaotic. Having escaped from Bedlam Psychiatric Hospital, Sal is an easy-going, sweet natured imp of the perverse and agent of trouble.
The two boys meet whilst working as the help at a vile cocktail party for the rich and corrupt. The boys make a connection, finding refuge in each other – the only shipmates on a drunken boat, tossed about on a stormy London sea. At the cocktail party, the elegant and sophisticated Colette reads the dangerously paranoid Impresario’s tarot cards, predicting the demise of the old, bloated and corrupt. This sets in motion a series of strange events that may connect together like a great unseen plan, or may simply be the random coincidences of an uncaring universe.
The boys become caught up in the cogs as they turn, like two rats caught in the machinery of Big Ben, as the cogs drags them ever nearer a terrifying climax. A confrontation between two different natures – the Impresario’s relentless ""progress"" of greed and brutality, and the boys’ urge for freedom, friendship and beauty. And ever present in the background is the dark and powerful Thames – representing the forces of nature, chance and instinct – but who will it back in this battle of heart and imagination versus bestial brutality?"
Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"Early 19th century England is beset by zombies; the Bennet sisters—Elizabeth, Jane, Kitty, Lydia, and Mary—have all been trained in the art of weaponry and martial arts in China at their father's behest so they can defend themselves from the zombies. Mrs. Bennet only wants to see her daughters married off to wealthy suitors. The Bennets attend a country dance also attended by Colonel Darcy and Caroline and Charles Bingley. There, the young and handsome Bingley falls for Jane. Charles Bingley has inherited £100,000 (£6.0 million today)—attracting Mrs. Bennet's attention as a desirable suitor for her daughter. When zombies attack the ball, the Bennet sisters fight them off, and Colonel Darcy, a friend of Bingley's and skilled zombie-killer, who was conversely trained in Japanese martial arts – with property that pays him £10,000 annually (£600,000 today) – becomes smitten with Elizabeth. On the way to the Bingleys' later, Jane is attacked by a zombie and catches a fever. Darcy orders her confined in fear that she may have been bitten but she recovers.
The Bennets are visited by the overbearing Parson Collins, who proposes to Elizabeth but states that she must give up her life as a warrior, something she refuses to do. Elizabeth meets a charming soldier named Wickham and arranges to meet him at another ball. She travels with him to a church that is filled with zombies who feed on pig brains instead of human brains, keeping their behaviour relatively normal. Wickham believes that with these new civilised zombies, humans can co-exist with them. He asks Elizabeth to elope but she backs off. Elizabeth learns that Darcy convinced the Bingleys to leave to keep Bingley away from Jane. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, having fallen in love with her, she expresses outrage at his actions and fights him.
Darcy later writes Elizabeth a letter to apologize. He reiterates that he separated Jane and Bingley for fear that Jane only wanted to marry Bingley for his wealth – having overheard Mrs. Bennet drunkenly mention it. He also exposes Wickham's true nature, he and Wickham were childhood friends but Wickham may have murdered Darcy's father, squandered his inheritance, then tried to elicit additional money from Darcy's estate; when that failed, Wickham tried to elope with Darcy's little sister, for her fortune. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has taken Lydia and London has been overrun with zombies. Darcy saves Lydia and learns that Wickham is using the 'civilised' zombies to create a zombie army, which has overrun London based on Wickham's planning and will rule the country. He stops him by giving the zombies human brains, which turns them savage.
While fighting, Darcy stabs Wickham's chest, revealing him to have been undead all along, staying civilized by consuming pig brains. Elizabeth saves Darcy from being killed by Wickham. As the two ride across the bridge, the army destroys it to keep the zombies from crossing over from London. Darcy is injured in the explosion and Elizabeth tearfully admits her love for him. After Darcy recovers, he proposes to Elizabeth again and this time, she agrees. The two have a joint wedding with Bingley and Jane. In a mid-credits scene, Wickham leads a horde of zombies toward the wedding celebration with the Four Horsemen of the Zombie Apocalypse riding behind him."
Christine,"Christine Chubbuck is a 29-year-old television reporter working in Sarasota. She frequently is at odds with her boss Michael who wants her to focus less on human interest pieces and more on crime, which brings in news ratings. She also nurses a crush on her co-worker George Peter Ryan.
Christine begins experiencing pains in her stomach. Going to the doctor she learns that she needs to have an ovary removed which will result in a decrease in the likelihood of her having children.
At work she learns the owner of the station has come to poach some of the Sarasota team and move them to Baltimore. Eager to earn the promotion, Christine takes her boss Michael's advice and buys a police scanner and begins listening to it, hoping for grittier stories. Though her pieces continue to be praised by her co-workers, Michael continues to tell her they are not what the station is looking for.
Christine tries to do another type of piece that combines documentary and recreation. Michael not only shoots the story down but also informs Christine that her piece will be replaced with a piece her friend and camera operator Jean had been working on. Christine lashes out, screaming at Michael in front of the whole station and telling him he has an alcoholic wife.
After taking the weekend off, Christine returns to work, and George asks her out to dinner and for a talk. At dinner, Christine confesses she puts up walls around people, and George also confides in her that he used to be an alcoholic. After dinner, George drives her to his old high school and reveals that he used to be an athlete and after injuring himself faced a loss of confidence and drug problems. He tells Christine he wants to help her and brings her into the gym where a self-help group is playing a game called ""Yes, But"" in which one person says their problems and the other person offers solutions. During the course of the game, Christine reveals to the other person that she is a virgin but desperately wants a biological child and a husband she loves.
After the session, George drives Christine home and tells her he is going to Baltimore. Leaving him, Christine drives to the home of the owner of the station, Bob Anderson, where she pretends she has a flat tire. Talking to him about the promotion, she learns that George asked for Andrea, the sports anchor, to be transferred along with him.
Returning to work Christine plays nice with Michael and asks him for his permission to do a piece. Michael agrees. Christine reads out several minutes of news on local crime, but when footage of a crime scene jams and she is asked to stall, she announces that the station will be airing a live suicide attempt, pulls out a gun, and shoots herself.
Initially, the other people at the station believe she is joking but quickly realize what happened was real. Christine is still breathing, and Jean accompanies her to the hospital where they are met by Christine's mother who was watching the broadcast.
Christine eventually succumbs to her injuries. Alone at home, Jean turns on her television, eats ice cream, and sings along to The Mary Tyler Moore Show theme song, something she had earlier told Christine she did as a way of coping with sadness."
Under the Shadow,"Amidst the terrors of war-torn post-revolutionary Tehran in the 1980s, former medical student Shideh is barred from resuming her studies because of her involvement with student leftist groups. Upon returning home, she gets rid of most of her old medical textbooks, but keeps a book of medical physiology given to her by her deceased mother. The war intensifying, Shideh elects to stay in the city with her daughter Dorsa despite the protests of her husband Iraj, a doctor who is called by the military and assigned to an area of heavy fighting. Iraj wants Shideh to stay with his parents in a safer part of the country, but Shideh refuses. Dorsa is upset to see her father go, and Iraj promises her that her favorite doll, Kimia, will protect her.
A new boy moves in with the neighboring Ebrahimi family, who are his cousins; his parents were killed in an attack. During a shelling, he whispers something into Dorsa's ear and hands her a charm to ward off evil spirits. Dorsa tells Shideh that the boy told her about the legend of the Djinn, and that the charm would protect her, though Shideh throws it away. Shideh visits Mrs. Ebrahimi, who informs her that the boy has been mute ever since the death of his parents. Dorsa develops a fever and has a slew of nightmares, and Shideh is also haunted by bad dreams.
During another shelling, a missile strikes their building, and an upstairs neighbor dies of a heart attack. Kimia goes missing in the commotion, and Dorsa insists that someone took her. Her behavior also becomes disturbed and erratic; she insists there is a strange presence in the house, and repeatedly tries to get into the upper floor, believing that Kimia is there. The daughter of the deceased neighbor visits Shideh and claims that her father was unaffected by the missile impact but she found him looking terrified, as if he had seen a ghost.
The neighbors gradually begin to leave to escape the fighting. Mrs. Ebrahimi warns Shideh that djinns may possess humans, and they will steal a beloved personal item of their victims. The Ebrahimis leave too, until Dorsa and Shideh are the only two inhabitants left in the building. Shideh's nightmares get worse, and her own items start to go missing. Her nightmares escalate to visions involving a floating chador that moves like a ghost. Dorsa admits to seeing the same apparitions, but claims that the ghostly woman in the chador wants to help her find Kimia. Shideh finally wants to leave to go to her husband's parents, but Dorsa refuses to leave until Kimia is found. Shideh receives a call seemingly from Iraj, but the caller begins to berate her for being a poor mother, as the djinn did. Shideh finds a mutilated Kimia, which upsets Dorsa. Shideh repairs Kimia with tape, but when they are about to leave, another air raid siren goes off.
Shideh promises Dorsa that they will escape, but while going down to the shelter, she hears Dorsa's screams. She panics, believing that the Dorsa she left with is another apparition, and returns home to find Dorsa. She sees what appears to be Dorsa under their bed, but when trying to rescue her, she discovers with horror that it is an apparition. Escaping to the shelter, she finds the real Dorsa. The two are attacked by the chador apparition, which separates the two before Shideh manages to find Dorsa. She urges Dorsa back up the stairs but is trapped when the floor begins to suck her down. Dorsa rescues Shideh and the two escape to the car, and Shideh drives them to Iraj's parents. However, it is revealed that Kimia's detached head was left behind and Shideh's medical textbook is still in the djinn's possession, implying they may still be harassed."
Sing Street,"In south inner-city Dublin in 1985, Robert Lawlor is struggling with his architecture practice and his marriage, and drinks and smokes to excess. At a family meeting, he announces that in order to save money he is taking his youngest son Conor out of his expensive fee-paying school and moving him to a Christian Brothers school, Synge Street CBS, which Robert asserts is of equally high repute. Conor's elder brother Brendan ribs him about the change as well as about the state of the family unit.
Conor appears in school on the first day in his new uniform, but without the regulation black shoes. The school principal Br. Baxter, takes him to task for this despite Conor’s pleas of being unable to afford new black shoes, eventually forcing him to complete the day shoeless. The shoe problem is resolved by painting the shoes black using paint from the art room. An encounter with the school bully, Barry introduces Conor to Darren, an ally and budding entrepreneur. When Conor tells the beautiful aspiring model, Raphina, in order to impress her, that he needs a model for a music video his band is making, Darren agrees to manage the band and introduces him to multi-instrumentalist Eamon.
The band practise in Eamon's living room, playing a bunch of 1980s covers. Conor however has a sibling-induced epiphany when Brendan encourages him to drop the covers and develop the band's own style. He begins writing original songs with Eamon. The band film their first music video for their song ""The Riddle of the Model"", wearing a motley assortment of often comical costumes, with Raphina acting as ingenue and makeup artist. Conor goes into school the next day wearing make up, he gets called into Baxter's office and told to remove the makeup. Conor refuses and as he walks away Baxter grabs him forcing him into the bathroom and forcibly removing the make up by pushing his face into a sink. Raphina gives Conor his nickname ""Cosmo"", which she says is more in keeping with his new band's image and the band continues to write and record new songs. After spending the day filming a music video for a new song, Conor and Raphina kiss and exchange confidences. Conor also manages to stand up to Barry by pointing out the insignificance of his life as well as his own, which greatly upsets Barry.

Later, she reveals that she was set to leave for London with her boyfriend that day, but he abandoned her. Deeply hurt by her lack of disclosure and becoming even more offended by her nonchalance, Conor breaks up with Raphina. Because of the break-up, along with his family's problems, Conor finds difficulty in writing or playing music, but Brendan urges Conor to carry on so that at least he can escape his small-town doldrums and make a better future for himself. An opportunity arises for the band to play live at an end of year party at school. Conor manages to strike a friendship with Barry, offering him the chance to be the band's roadie and escape the physically and emotionally abusive relationship he has with his alcoholic father, which he accepts.
Conor prepares a new song, ""Brown Shoes"", mocking Baxter, which the band perform as an encore while distributing homemade masks of Baxter’s face. Raphina arrives before the band finishes their song and reconciles with Conor, and both of them leave the party and the school in uproar. After secretly saying his goodbyes to his family later that night, Conor and Raphina persuade Brendan to drive them to Dalkey so they can escape in the motor cruiser and head to London. Brendan agrees and drives them to the harbour, where Brendan and Conor exchange an emotional embrace. Conor and Raphina sail out to sea, following the ferry across the rough Irish Sea to a new life in London. Brendan watches them disappear into the distance and cheers, overjoyed that his younger brother has left to go on to greater things."
Complete Unknown,"Alice (Weisz) an ever-changing woman in her thirties, is seen doing many professions in many parts of the world. She comes back to New York City after spending most of her twenties abroad under different identities to see Tom, an old college flame. While researching Tom (Shannon), she plans an interaction with his colleague, Clyde at their work cafeteria. She tells Clyde a story of her being a biologist and how she spent the last few years in Tasmania, Australia. She also explains why she is back in NYC. She tells him about a new species of a frog on Long Island. Clyde, obviously taken with Alice, invites her to Tom's birthday party.
Later that night, Tom and his wife Ramina are getting ready for their friends to come over for dinner. Ramina is a jewelry designer and was recently accepted into a design program in San Diego. The two start to bicker as Tom mentions that a committee meeting for a project at work isn't going to be held until September, therefore bringing up the move to CA. Tom leaves to go to the bakery as his friends arrive to fix the spelling of his name on the cake. Clyde arrives with Alice and she is quite a hit with his friends, talking about the new species of frog and her work in Australia. As Tom makes a toast to his friends, he sees Alice and is stunned to see her. She introduces herself and the group have dinner. Alice discusses her travels to Mexico as a teen and how she changed her name from Jennifer, therefore beginning her change of identities. Some of the friends in the group question her choices. Alice also says that she hasn't seen her parents since she left her home since she has never been back. Taken back by her way of life, Clyde is shocked as he didn't know this. Later on the balcony, Tom confronts Alice, calling her Jenny and tells her that he thought she was dead. He also says that she just took off and have had no contact in 15 years. He asks what she wants and asks if she has been home to see her parents since her father once begged Tom to tell him where Alice/Jenny was. Alice explains that she tried to see her parents but couldn't leave the car and that her father died two years ago.
While lighting the candles for the cake, some of the friends in the group are divided in their opinion of Alice. They are either amazed at Alice's courage or angry that she could have so little compassion for those who care for her, particularly Tom. The topic of Ramina moving to CA comes up and she and Tom tell their friends that they are not sure what to do as it is a tough situation. Tom gets angry at his friends butting into his marriage and tells the group they should all go dancing.
While at the club, Alice does a magic trick with olives at the bar and explains that she toured China for a few months as a magician's assistant. Clyde confronts her as that is not what she told him previously, catching her in a lie. The other friends soon turn on her and ask if she just made that all up. Alice grabs her bag and decides to leave. Tom runs after her and asks her if she has actually been to Australia and Alice explains why she does what she does. She says that once something feels too familiar, she decides to start fresh and has done so nine different times. New cities, new names and new professions. The two run into Nina (Bates) while she is walking her dog. Nina falls and sprains her ankle. Tom and Alice help Nina home. There, Alice says that she is a Cardiologist and that Tom is also a doctor. The two meet Roger (Glover) and Tom soon enjoys the whole process of pretending to be someone else. Alice explains that they met in college, but are not together and Tom is married to Ramina. While looking at Nina's back at her request, Tom is suddenly shaken and the two decide to leave.
Later, Tom and Alice discuss the past, particularly how Tom didn't want to be responsible for Alice leaving school since she was supposed to 'have this whole life.' Alice discusses how he looked at her so differently once he found out that she was a piano prodigy. She explains the intense pressure she was under and how she didn't know anything but piano. Alice talks about why she disappeared and Tom tells her that he was jealous of her since she was so driven. He also talks about his dissatisfaction of his job and how he feels that if he left it all, he would feel like a failure. He asks her if she made everything about the frogs and Australia up and she says no. He asks her to show him who she really is now.
Alice takes Tom to the lab where she works. He meets her lab partner James. There they both dress to go out and hear the frogs sing. After they both walk in the woods and hear the frogs, they begin to head back to the city. Alice removes the picture from her desk and looks around the lab as if she is going to leave once more. While on the train, Tom asks what is next and asks her if he can see how she leaves and becomes someone else. As Alice packs her things, Tom asks her how she keeps track of all her identities. She says that 'keeping track isn't that hard part and that the hard part is when everyone around you thinks they know who you are and they try to lay claim to you and you are trapped.' Tom tells her to stop doing it, she laughs. He tells her that all of these people she tries to be are actually just her. Alice asks Tom to come with her, but he says no. As they say goodbye outside her building, Tom says it was good to see her again. The two parts ways and Tom returns home to Ramina. He says to Ramina "" Um, about California. I've been thinking."" The scene then cuts away, leaving the movie viewer to question whether or not Tom will actually go with Ramina to California, and whether or not their marriage survives his encounter with Alice.
The scene then changes to Alice in a bus station, train station, or airport bathroom. She is getting rid of all her credit cards, but keeps her New York State Drivers license. She puts it in her notebook that she has keep through the years to chronicle all her identity changes. The film ends with Alice disappearing into a crowd of people on a busy street wearing a dark, heavy coat, her hair down. She is walking away from the camera. Then, after she slowly disappears into the crowd of people, and you can't see her anymore, she reappears walking towards the camera, hair up, wearing a different outfit, a white vest with a white shirt underneath. This leaves the viewer to decide whether or not she was walking on the streets of New York City and had decided to stay in order to pursue Tom and perhaps build a future together with him, or whether or not she was in a different city developing a new identity."
Eddie the Eagle,"In 1973, ten-year-old Eddie Edwards dreams of Olympic glory, practicing in various Olympic events and failing miserably. His mother unconditionally supports him, while his father constantly discourages him. As a young teen, he gives up his dream of participating in the Summer Games in favour of skiing in the Winter Games. Although successful at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realizing he could make the team as a ski jumper (a sport in which the United Kingdom had not participated in six decades), he decamps to a training facility in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. The more seasoned jumpers, specifically those on the Norwegian team, belittle him.
He self-trains, and after successfully completing the 15-metre (49 ft) hill on his first try, he injures himself on his first try from a 40-metre (130 ft) hill. Alcoholic snow groomer Bronson Peary encourages Eddie to give up, but Eddie's tenacious spirit and shared feelings of ostracism by the other jumpers there convince him to train Eddie. Peary is a former champion American ski jumper who left the sport in his 20s after a conflict with his mentor, famous ski jumper Warren Sharp, which Eddie learns from Petra, the kindly owner of a nearby tavern. With very little time to qualify for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Eddie and Bronson employ various unorthodox methods to condition and refine Eddie's form, and he successfully completes the 40m hill.
To qualify for the British Olympic division in ski jumping, Eddie only needs to complete a jump from a 70-metre (230 ft) hill in order to qualify for the Winter Olympics. Not long after, he manages to land the jump successfully, with a distance of 34 metres (112 ft), thus winning a place on the British Olympic Team. However, the officials, in an effort to keep Eddie from sullying the Winter Games with his amateurish skillset, decide to change the rules and demand that he jump at least 61 metres (200 ft). Though discouraged, Eddie decides to continue training and performs on a circuit, his jumps increasing in length each time, but unable to meet the Olympic requirements. During a practice jump at the final event before the cutoff date for qualification, he lands a 61m jump exactly, but on his official jump, he falls and is disqualified. Eddie is devastated and resolves to return home to work with his father as a plasterer, but he receives a letter claiming that his qualifying practice jump is valid, and he happily tells Bronson that he's eligible to compete in the Winter Olympics. Bronson tries to dissuade him, promising that he will make a complete fool of himself and his country if he goes, but Eddie is undeterred, noting that competing in the Olympics was always enough for him.
Upon arriving in Calgary, he receives instant scorn from the other British athletes, who get him drunk and nearly provoke him into fighting after he is subsequently absent from the opening ceremonies. Despite finishing last in the 70m jump with 60.5 metres (198 ft), Eddie sets a British record. His triumphant celebrations win the audience over, and the media embrace him as Eddie ""The Eagle"". Over the phone, Bronson criticises Edwards for not taking the sport seriously. Edwards publicly apologizes to the press for his antics, and wanting to ensure he does not leave the games as little more than a novelty, he enters the 90-metre (300 ft) jump, which he had never attempted before. Bronson decides to travel to the games and support him. After an encouraging conversation with his idol Matti ""The Flying Finn"" Nykänen on the lift to the top of the hill, Eddie barely manages to land a 71.5-metre (235 ft) jump. Once again, he scores last in the event, but is nonetheless cheered by the audience as well as millions around the world, which includes a playful salute in the closing speech of the President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, Frank King. British Olympic officials grudgingly accept him.
Warren Sharp reconciles with Bronson, who was present, and Edwards returns home a national hero to the cheers of his fans at the airport, his mother rushes to him embracing him. And as Eddie looks to his father, he reveals a jumper declaring his support before then embracing Eddie as well."

The studio's major production is Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ, an epic set in ancient Roman times and starring Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). During a shot, Whitlock drinks from a goblet of wine that was drugged by an extra (Wayne Knight); he passes out while rehearsing lines by himself behind the soundstage and is abducted. A ransom note soon arrives, written by a group calling itself ""The Future,"" demanding $100,000. Mannix arranges to get the money from the studio's Accounting Department, as ""petty cash.""
Whitlock awakens in a beach house and finds his way into a meeting of The Future, a Communist cell. The members, who introduce themselves as mostly writers in the motion picture industry, explain their doctrine to him and begin to win him over to their cause. At the same time, Thora threatens Mannix by stating she will release an article about a scandal involving the earlier film On Wings As Eagles, which gave Whitlock his break-out role. Mannix successfully negotiates for her to postpone the story by a day in exchange for information about the romantic life of singing Western film star Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich).
Doyle is cast in a comedy of manners helmed by posh director Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes) in an attempt by the studio to broaden his appeal. After Doyle's initial performance is hopelessly incompetent, Laurentz visits Mannix and asks him to remove Doyle from the project so that Laurentz can preserve his artistic vision for the film. Mannix informs Laurentz that Doyle's role is non-negotiable and convinces him to coach the young actor to give a better performance. Doyle comes to Mannix's office and admits that he feels the part is too far outside his comfort zone. Mannix reassures him that he has the needed acting abilities and tells him about Whitlock's kidnapping.
That evening, Doyle attends the premiere of one of his own Westerns with starlet Carlotta Valdez (Verónica Osorio), per instructions from Mannix. Doyle is initially disappointed that his lone singing scene is depicted in a comedic manner, rather than as heartfelt as he intended. However, after seeing the audience react positively to the scene, Doyle warms to it himself. Doyle and Valdez visit a nightclub, where the pair are genuinely developing chemistry until they are interrupted by both Thacker sisters, each looking to get a scoop on their relationship. Doyle suddenly spots the briefcase containing the ransom money, recognizing it because he had lent Mannix his belt to keep it closed. It is being carried by Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), the star of a sailor musical comedy depicted earlier in an elaborate dancing scene.
Mannix and Moran meet with a surety agent, Joseph Silverman (Jonah Hill), an average man whom the studio has used to solve public problems; he has a solid reputation as completely dependable, reliable, and discreet. He will agree to provide foster care for Moran's child, preserving her image. Moran, who expressed frustration with her previous two marriages with a mobster and a Hollywood type, finds herself strongly attracted to Silverman.
Doyle follows Gurney to the beach house in Malibu but, after walking in the front door, finds only Whitlock inside. The rest of The Future's members have rowed a boat containing Gurney offshore so that he can rendezvous with a Soviet submarine and defect to Russia. The members of The Future give him the money for the Communist cause. As Gurney boards the submarine, his dog jumps into his arms, causing him to drop the briefcase, which sinks into the ocean. Doyle takes Whitlock back to the studio just before the police arrive at the beach house to arrest the group, after Mannix's investigation led him to the house.
Whitlock tries to explain his new-found Communist leanings to Mannix, who cuts him off sharply, slapping his face numerous times, and orders him to finish his role in Hail, Caesar!; the actor is chastened, but encouraged by a final directive from Mannix to be a movie star.
Mannix is notified the next morning that Moran married Silverman who will adopt the child with her. Mannix announces he has decided to reject the Lockheed offer and continue working at Capitol. Thora then meets with Mannix and informs him that the column she plans to publish about On Wings As Eagles will reveal that Whitlock got his major role in the film by having sex with Laurentz. However, Mannix has deduced that Gurney is her source for the piece and persuades her to not run the story since Gurney is a Communist who has defected—which would cause her own reputation to suffer by association. Mannix leaves the worried-looking Thora, secure in his station in life.
Set in 1951,[4] Hail, Caesar! takes place at a transitional time for the film industry. The studio system was breaking down, and a Supreme Court ruling had forced studios to divest their movie theaters. Television, then still in its early years, threatened to pull away audiences. The Cold War and the Red Scare were both underway. Hollywood responded by creating escapist fare: westerns, highly choreographed dance and aquatic spectacles, and, as the film title suggests, Roman epics with massive casts.[5]
Writing in The Washington Post, Kristen Page-Kirby noted that the nostalgia for Hollywood's golden age is heavily filtered by time. ""It’s easy to look back at any part of the past and say, 'Yeah, that’s how it should be today'. Hail, Caesar! uses the uniformly terrible fake movies within it to show that while we all remember 1946 for stuff like The Yearling and Notorious, it also gave us Tarzan and the Leopard Woman.""[6] The Coens cited their own examples of sub-par films and performances from the era that they saw as television re-runs while growing up: That Touch of Mink (1962), and Laurence Olivier, in mahogany makeup, co-starring with Charlton Heston in Khartoum (1966). ""We loved that stuff. We just didn’t realize we were watching crap"", said Joel Coen.[7]"
Dad's Army,"It is summer, 1944 and the invasion of Normandy is approaching. Nazi forces in France, seeking intelligence on the invasion location, send their best spy to a town on England's channel coastline, Walmington-on-Sea. In the town, Captain Mainwaring's Home Guard is suffering from a lack of luck and appreciation. This is until an elegant journalist, Rose Winters, arrives to report on the platoon's motives and activities, allegedly for The Lady magazine. The platoon are charmed by her presence, especially Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson, causing feuds with the townsfolk, especially the platoon's wives. Adding to tensions it emerges Sergeant Wilson and Rose Winters shared a past dalliance at Oxford University.
Meanwhile, MI5 detect a radio signal transmitted from Walmington-on-Sea towards Berlin, believed to be from the Nazi spy. MI5's Major Cunningham and Captain Meeks locate Captain Mainwaring and inform him of the enemy presence, stating ""it could be anyone"". This news gives the Home Guard a chance to locate the spy and make a real difference in the war. They meet Ms. Winters who poses as a journalist while they are practicing a routine of catch the Nazi after Wilson is chosen to play the Nazi.
While accompanying the platoon on a patrol, designated Top Secret by the British Army, Winters discovers the Dover base is intended to deceive German air reconnaissance, part of the (real) Operation Bodyguard. Winters now knows the invasion will target Normandy. As the platoon searches for the spy, Rose claims it is Sergeant Wilson. Captain Mainwaring believes Rose and arrests Wilson. However, Private Godfrey's sisters investigate Rose and find evidence questioning her journalist credentials and that Rose has a home address in Berlin. The platoon and their wives rally to stop Winters and exchange fire with a German U-boat and a Wehrmacht landing party who are helping Winters escape.
The U-boat flees without Winters boarding. Mainwaring arrests Winters and hands her over to MI5. The troop then parade through Walmington, having fought off the Nazis, and are congratulated by Colonel Theakes. Mainwaring and Wilson reconcile. Theakes underlines the platoon success by telling them they have played a prominent part in the war effort."
War on Everyone,"Terry Monroe and Bob Bolaño, two corrupt cops, return to the Albuquerque police force after being suspended for assaulting a racist coworker. Bolaño and Monroe regularly rob and extort criminals, accept bribes, and take drugs. While surveilling small time thieves, the two come to believe Jimmy Harris, a local criminal, is planning a heist. They contact one of Harris' former associates, Reggie, and coerce him into revealing information by threatening to falsely arrest him. Reggie and his friend, Irishman Pádraic Power, identify Clifford Reynard, a getaway driver, and tell them Harris' girlfriend, Jackie Hollis, used to dance at a strip club owned by Russell Birdwell. Birdwell, though suspicious, reveals Hollis' address. After bursting into Harris' house and knocking him out, they extort several expensive possessions.
Meanwhile, Birdwell tells his boss, James Mangan, a knighted British businessman who is in charge of the heist, the cops have been asking about Hollis. Mangan tells Birdwell to intimidate both Hollis and the cops. Monroe returns to Hollis and gives her a replacement television. After flirting with each other, they have sex and begin seeing each other. While staking out Reynard's house to extort him, too, they hear a scream. In the house, they find that Reynard's wife has murdered him, though she is too hysterical to explain why. Irritated, the cops attempt to quiet her while they consider their next step. Reynard's teenage son flees, but they are unable to catch him. After a nightmare, Monroe becomes concerned and searches the city for the missing boy. As he does this, Birdwell scares Bolaño's wife by smashing the window of her shop as she talks to Hollis.
With Reynard dead, Reggie takes his place in the heist, though he misleads Bolaño and Monroe into believing it will be taking place elsewhere. When the cops finally catch on to him, they discover Harris and his cohorts dead. Not knowing Mangan's involvement, they assume Reggie is responsible. Before going after Reggie, they learn about Birdwell's harassment and beat him so badly that he loses an eye. Knowing they have numerous enemies and believing themselves untouchable anyway, they do not bother asking who sent him. Reggie's friend Power, when offered a bribe, tells them Reggie fled to Iceland. Though they know nothing more than that, they leave for Iceland, reasoning that an African American man will stick out. To Bolaño's amazement, the plan works, and they spontaneously find him in a crowd. Under pressure, Reggie reveals Mangan's involvement and agrees to split his take from the heist with them.
Back in Albuquerque, Lieutenant Stanton says Birdwell has filed charges against them. Monroe and Bolaño assure him that their investigation is nearing completion and will involve Birdwell. As Monroe and Bolaño search for Mangan, they chance upon Reynard's child, who is living homeless on the streets. Monroe insists on becoming the boy's foster parent over the protests of Bolaño, who, as a parent, believes Monroe unprepared for the responsibility. Hollis, who has temporarily moved in with Monroe after Birdwell's attack, also voices her skepticism, but the three eventually come to care for each other. Although Mangan's thugs kidnap and beat Monroe, he laughs off their attempt to intimidate him, saying he has already been raped. Not wanting to kill a cop, they release him. However, after Monroe and Bolaño harass Mangan during a business meeting, Lieutenant Stanton finally fires them.
Mangan beheads Power and contacts the cops, hoping to entrap them with an offer of sharing the money. Reynard's son, however, tells Monroe that his mother killed Reynard because she found out he was part of a child pornography ring run by Mangan. Enraged, Monroe enlists Bolaño to help kill Mangan, having lost interest in the money. In the resulting shootout, Bolaño is apparently killed but reveals he was wearing a bulletproof vest. The two shoot Birdwell as he begs for his life. Then they kill Mangan as he attempts to bribe them. Monroe, Hollis, Reynard's son, Bolaño and his family, Reggie and Reggie's transgender girlfriend all party together on the beach in Iceland afterward."

Alone in Berlin,"In 1940, a working-class couple in World War II-era Berlin, Otto and Anna Quangel, decide to resist Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, after receiving the news of the death of their only son. An additional impetus for their growing resistance to the regime is the fate of an old Jewish woman living in their building. Though the official deportation of Jews to death camps had not yet started, Jews have no recourse to any legal protection. Ruthless Nazis — and ""non-ideological"" common criminals — use the opportunity to loot the old woman's apartment with impunity. Despite the efforts of the Quangels and other kind neighbors to help her, the persecution ends with the old woman jumping to her death from a high floor window.
Impelled by all this, the couple starts writing postcards to urge people to stand against Hitler and the Nazis and protest against them, and furtively placing the cards in public places - a capital crime.[2][3] Their first card reads: ""Mothers, Hitler Will Kill Your Son Too"". At first, Otto wants to do it all by himself, warning Anna, ""They hang women, too!"" She, however, insists on taking part in this dangerous activity. While in the beginning of the film the couple's marriage seems to have dried up, being unable to console each other for the loss of their son, their shared risk and commitment brings them back closer, in effect falling in love with each other all over again.
Escherich is the police inspector charged with finding the source of the postcards.[4] He is a professional police detective, acting out of professional pride rather than Nazi ideology. During three years of painstakingly gathering clues about the ""Hobgoblin"" (as he calls the mysterious writer of the postcards) he develops an increasing respect for this elusive unknown opponent. With the lack of progress in his investigation, Escherich is beaten up by the obviously impatient S.S. senior officer, and is further forced thereby, to execute extrajudicially, a man whom he is certain has no connection with these subversive postcards.
Finally, Otto Quangel is arrested due to the accidental fall of postcards out of his pocket, while at work. He remains, though, stoic about the certain death sentence awaiting him, and only tries in vain to take all the blame on himself and save Anna. After the couple has been executed, Escherich is alone in his office. He gathers up all of the couple's hundreds of subversive postcards, scatters them out of the open window of the police headquarters, and shoots himself. The film ends with the image of the postcards swirling in the wind, falling down on the Berlin streets and picked up by passersby — giving the film's protagonists a posthumous moral victory."
Genius,"The film is set in New York in 1929. Maxwell Perkins, a Scribner's successful editor and discoverer of talented authors such as Francis Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, lives in a cottage just outside the city with his wife and five daughters. One day, in his office, he reads the drafts of O Lost, a novel by Thomas Wolfe. Struck by the content, Perkins decides to publish it and begins to collaborate with the author. The novel is eventually published and proves to be a huge success: fifteen thousand copies sold in a single month. Max and Thomas become best friends, while Wolfe's relationship with Aline Bernstein, a married woman twenty years older than he, is severely tested after the publication of Wolfe's novel. Max manages to publish Wolfe's second novel, Of Time and the River, after exhausting revision work that lasts for years. The second novel is also a success.
Meanwhile, Thomas is in Paris where he follows the events remotely, thanks to news received from Max. Back in New York, he immediately goes to work, writing his new book. His turbulent character leads him to quarrel with Max, destroying the relationship between the two and making Wolfe turn to another editor. Aline finally leaves Thomas, because he is too self-absorbed and unable to care for others. After Max has reconciled himself with Thomas's absence, a phone call comes from Thomas' mother: Thomas has contracted milial tuberculosis. Despite surgery, Thomas shows no signs of improving. After a few weeks he dies, but before that he writes a letter to Max, reaffirming his immense affection for him."
Grimsby,"""Nobby"" Butcher has been separated from his little brother Sebastian for 28 years. During the years of separation, Nobby has become an alcoholic and has started his own life with his girlfriend Dawn and 11 children in the English seaport town of Grimsby.
Sebastian (now Sebastian Graves) has become one of MI6's top agents. After completing an interrogation, Sebastian comes into information regarding philanthropist Rhonda George, who is hosting a benefit called WorldCure and is a potential target for assassination, and is assigned to go. Nobby's pub friends also find out that his brother will be at WorldCure and convince Nobby to go and reconnect with him. Sebastian goes to the event and sees a hitman, later known as Pavel Lukashenko, who plans to assassinate Rhonda with a gun disguised as a video camera. As Sebastian prepares to shoot the camera, Nobby sees him and gives him a hug, accidentally causing him to shoot a Jewish-Palestinian boy with AIDS named Schlomo. The spray of blood lands in Daniel Radcliffe's mouth, infecting him.
The brothers go on the run from the authorities and other assassins, with Sebastian breaking his ankle in the process. Despite Sebastian's protests, Nobby convinces him it would be best to hide at his home in Grimsby. Meanwhile, MI6 believes that Sebastian has gone rogue. The MI6 send orders to an assassin named Chilcott to track Sebastian down. However, Sebastian calls his handler Jodie and proclaims his innocence.
Chilcott and his men find the two brothers at a pub. Sebastian and Nobby spot them and run away with help from the pub clientele, but Sebastian is hit with two Lonomia poison darts in the process. Nobby is forced to first suck the poison out of his brother's shoulder and then his testicle to save his life.
The brothers travel to South Africa, after Jodie informs Sebastian that Lukashenko was doing a deal with Joris Smit in Tshukaru Bush Lodge. Sebastian accidentally injects himself with heroin, mistaking it for the bone strengthening treatment for his broken ankle. Nobby must assume his identity and go undercover.
Nobby tries to seduce Joris's wife Lina, but first seduces the wrong woman named Banu the Cleaner and is then interrupted by Joris and his two men. Sebastian arrives and saves Nobby. Lina tells them that Lukashenko bought some sort of virus, but she is fatally shot by Chilcott and his men from a distance before she gives any further information. To outrun Chilcott's men, the brothers hide inside an elephant's vagina, but in the process they become trapped inside after multiple male elephants begin having sexual intercourse with it in quick succession. As they wash off afterwards, Sebastian asks why Nobby abandoned him as a child. Nobby explains that Sebastian's adoptive parents only wanted to adopt one of the brothers but were unable to decide, and he ran away so Sebastian could have a better life.
The two brothers travel to Santiago, Chile, the venue of football game final between England and Germany. They realise that the syndicate plans to unleash their weapon upon a football match in the area, but the syndicate captures Sebastian. Rhonda visits the captured Sebastian and tells him her plans to launch the virus—called WorldCure—into the arena via fireworks. Nobby finally finds Sebastian, but he is intercepted by Lukashenko. Lukashenko overpowers Nobby, but he obtains Lukashenko's gun and shoots him in the head. He easily kills the other henchmen before rescuing Sebastian.
The brothers go back to the arena and spot Rhonda. While Nobby tries to intercept Rhonda, Chilcott attempts to kill Sebastian, but Nobby's kids throw Schlomo's wheelchair at him, knocking him over and impaling on a helmet. Nobby obtains a gun and spotted Rhonda running through the arena. He goes after her. In the meantime, Raheem Sterling in the final match between England and Germany attempts a shot from a distance, however, the shot was going wide. Nobby shot the ball and it conveniently deflected into the goal. Nobby also shot the referee who's going to disallow the goal, resulting in England winning the match. Nobby then tries to shoot Rhonda but his gun jams and he realises he must stop the fireworks himself. He sits on one of the fireworks containing the virus; Sebastian sits on the other at the last minute, reaffirming his brotherhood with Nobby. The fireworks go off with the two atop them and the brothers are knocked unconscious upon landing. Nobby's gun goes off and hits Daniel Radcliffe, whose infectious blood spills into Donald Trump's mouth.
It is reported that Rhonda is arrested, the Grimsby brothers ""died"" after saving the world, and Trump has AIDS. Schlomo is in custody after ""killing"" Chilcott. The brothers are actually recovering in the hospital. Jodie visits and gives them new identities, informing them that the virus did not affect them because its antidote is elephant semen. Nobby's family visits them.
In the final scene, eight weeks later, Nobby and Sebastian are on a mission in Jakarta, Indonesia. On a boat, Nobby is approached by a team of gunmen, whom he quickly kills. He reaches Sebastian, who asks him if he's met the team; Nobby realises too late that the gunmen were his team.
In a post credit scene the brothers are in a car and stop to ask a man for directions to the stadium, after receiving directions Nobby shoots the man saying 'leave no witnesses', disturbing Sebastian."
The Other Side of the Door,"After losing her son Oliver in a car accident in India, Maria has not recovered from the tragedy. During the accident, Maria chose to save her youngest daughter, Lucy instead of Oliver and the guilt devastated her. One night, her husband Michael finds Maria unconscious after a failed suicide attempt. In the hospital, Maria is comforted by her housekeeper Piki. Piki asks Maria if she wants one final chance to say goodbye to Oliver. She explains that in her village, there is an abandoned temple where the line between the living and the dead is very thin. Maria must scatter her son's ashes at the temple steps and lock herself in. Oliver will speak to her once night falls. However, no matter what Oliver says, Maria must not open the temple door for him. Maria agrees and the pair have Oliver's body exhumed and burned. Maria notices some strange men covered in ash. Piki explains that they are shamans who consume the flesh of the dead and coat themselves in ash to strengthen their bonds between the worlds of the living and the dead.
The next day Maria arrives at the temple and follows Piki's instructions. Inside, she uncovers a mummified corpse of a woman. Night falls and Oliver begins talking to Maria, who apologises to Oliver for leaving him. Oliver starts pleading with Maria to open the door and explains that someone is taking him. Maria panics and opens the door, but sees no one. She returns home the next day; now having closure, she focuses her attention on Michael and Lucy, but doesn't tell Piki that she opened the door. Strange things start happening; their piano plays itself and Lucy tells Maria that Oliver has come back and that he is hiding from someone. In Oliver's room, a chair moves toward her, along with The Jungle Book, which Maria was reading to Oliver when he died, but never finished. Realising Oliver wants her to finish the book, she does so. Piki notices that the nearby plants have started dying and begins to realise that Maria had disobeyed her instructions at the temple.
Later, the decomposed body of Oliver appears near Lucy. Maria discovers a bite mark on her shoulder. She enters Oliver's room and tells him that he can't hurt Lucy. Oliver pulls out the chair and book again and Maria starts reading to him as long as he doesn't hurt Lucy. A shaman appears at the house and points behind Maria; she sees the mummified body from the temple behind her, which chases her. The next day, an outraged Piki confronts Maria and explains to her that due to her actions, Oliver's soul cannot be properly reincarnated and has become evil. She reveals to Maria that the strange figure she has been seeing is Myrtu, the gatekeeper of the underworld, who reclaims the soul of the dead. Piki urges Maria to burn all of Oliver’s possessions to break his hold on the living world.
While Piki attempts to discard and burn all of Oliver's remaining possessions, Oliver uses the guise of Piki's dead daughter to lure her to a pond and drown her. After Piki's funeral, Michael comes home and discovers Maria has finished burning Oliver's possessions. Distraught and angry, Michael does not believe Maria as she attempts to explain her actions. Reinforcing his mistrust, Lucy suddenly denies any knowledge of Oliver returning. Maria after realises that Oliver has possessed Lucy. Michael believes that Maria is becoming mentally unhinged and locks her in a room.
The shamans begin to crowd the house; the possessed Lucy kills the family dog with a knife and stabs a horrified Michael. Maria breaks out and heads up to Oliver's room where she sees shamans chanting over Lucy's body. Since they cannot remove the spirit from Lucy, they plan to sacrifice her. However, Michael stops them and Maria tells Oliver that he needs to leave. Oliver says he is scared, but Maria says she will go with him. Oliver’s spirit leaves Lucy’s body and enters Maria's. She charges the shaman with the knife telling him to take her instead. He obliges, fatally stabbing her. She falls and awakens in the room alone. Myrtu appears and takes Maria to the afterlife.
Maria then wakes up and briefly believes that she is alive. She hears Michael's voice call out for her. She sees the temple steps and realises Michael is attempting the same ritual to bring back Maria as she did with Oliver. Maria screams for him not to open the door, and the terror repeats itself again."
The Pass,"Nineteen-year-old Jason and Ade have been in the Academy of a famous London football club since they were eight years old. It's the night before their first-ever game for the first team — a Champions League match — and they're in a hotel room in Romania. They should be sleeping, but they're over-excited. They skip, fight, mock each other, prepare their kit, watch a teammate's sex tape. And then, out of nowhere, one of them kisses the other. The impact of this 'pass' reverberates through the next ten years of their lives — a decade of fame and failure, secrets and lies, in a sporting world where image is everything.[2]"
Criminal,"When Spanish industrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl arranges for his associate Jan Strook—a hacker known as ""the Dutchman""—to create a wormhole program that would allow the owner to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes, the Dutchman panics and attempts to hand his secret over to the CIA. He makes contact with London-based agent Bill Pope, but although Pope is able to get the Dutchman to a safe house and recover the money to pay him for his services, he is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman.
Desperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's CIA supervisor Quaker Wells contacts Dr. Micah Franks, who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memory patterns of a dead man onto a living one. Keeping Pope's brain stimulated to preserve its knowledge, Franks requests that convict Jerico Stewart be the subject of the procedure, as Stewart's criminal behavior is the result of childhood brain trauma leaving him with an underdeveloped frontal lobe, hindering his emotional development and impulse control, that they can use to ""graft"" Pope's knowledge into Stewart's mind.
While the process initially appears unsuccessful, Jerico is able to escape custody while being transferred after the operation, faking his death and heading to Pope's house, where he ties Pope's wife, Jillian, to her bed and gags her mouth with duct tape, is able to disable the house alarms and delay an investigation of the silent alarm which Jillian manages to activate. As time goes on, he experiences memory flashes of Pope's past, but all he can determine is that the bag of money was hidden behind a shelf of books relating to George Orwell, without identifying where it or the Dutchman are kept.
The CIA becomes increasingly anxious to find the Dutchman when they learn that he is now planning to sell the program to the Russians, believing that the CIA has betrayed him. Fortunately, they are able to find Jerico after he contacts Dr. Franks for medication using Pope's CIA codes, Franks's questioning confirming that Jerico is developing emotions as well as drawing on Pope's experience. As Jerico attempts to retrace the route Pope took to hide the Dutchman, Heimdahl creates a distraction at the airport that draws Quaker's attention, allowing Heimdahl's henchwoman Elsa to try and capture Jerico, killing his CIA guards before Jerico escapes by driving off a bridge.
His leg injured in his escape, Jerico retreats to the Pope house, where he encounters Jillian and explains the situation to her. Although initially concerned, Jillian comes to accept Jerico's story as she sees him interacting with her daughter, Emma, allowing Jerico to stay the night. Jerico forms a bond with the two. The next morning, Jerico realizes through a conversation with Jillian that the bag is hidden in the rare books collection at the University of London where she works. He attempts to retrieve the bag, but he is captured by Heimdahl and Elsa once he has found it. Heimdahl forces him to take them to the Dutchman or he will kill Jillian and Emma.
With the CIA and a Russian strike team now seeking the Dutchman, Jerico—who has recalled that Pope hid the Dutchman in Jillian's office at the university—is able to escape Elsa using an improvised nitro-glycerine bomb, returning to the office to provide a hurried explanation to the Dutchman. The two are caught by Elsa before they can escape, Jerico is shot in the shoulder and after she kills the Dutchman, Jerico knocks her out with a potted cactus before killing her by bashing her head in with a lamp.
Taking the flash drive containing the wormhole program to the airfield where Heimdahl is attempting an escape, Jerico is able to save Jillian and Emma despite Quaker's protests about the danger Heimdahl could pose with the program. As Heimdahl's plane takes off, Jerico reveals to Quaker that he had the Dutchman reprogram the wormhole so that it would target the source of the next transmission, resulting in Heimdahl unwittingly destroying his own plane when he tries to fire a missile at the airfield.
A few months later, Jerico is shown on the beach where Pope and Jillian had their honeymoon, initially unresponsive to anything but automatic reflexes and responses. With all other options exhausted, Quaker and Franks take Jillian and Emma to see him, the sight of Pope's family confirming that some part of Pope exists in Jerico when he responds with a nose-tap that was Pope and Jillian's way of saying ""I love you"" in private. Witnessing this, Quaker reflects that he will offer Jerico a job."

Adult Life Skills,"Anna is stuck: she's approaching 30, living like a hermit in her mum's garden shed and wondering why the suffragettes ever bothered. She spends her days making videos using her thumbs as actors - thumbs that bicker about things like whether Yogi Bear is a moral or existential nihilist. But Anna doesn't show these videos to anyone and no one knows what they are for. A week before her birthday her Mum serves her an ultimatum - she needs to move out of the shed, get a haircut that doesn't put her gender in question and stop dressing like a homeless teenager. Naturally, Anna tells her Mum to ""back the f-off"". However, when her school friend comes to visit, Anna's self-imposed isolation becomes impossible to maintain. Soon she is entangled with a troubled eight year old boy obsessed with Westerns, and the local estate agent whose awkward interpersonal skills continually undermine his attempts to seduce her."
Special Correspondents,"News radio journalist Frank Bonneville (Eric Bana) enters a murder scene posing as a cop. After getting the details of the crime, he is removed from the premises and, immediately after, reports the story live on the radio. When he returns to the station, Frank is applauded by colleagues on getting the story before any other press, but his boss Geoffrey Mallard (Kevin Pollak) warns that if he breaks the law one more time, he'll be fired.
That night, everyman Ian Finch (Ricky Gervais), who is also Frank's sound technician, takes his wife Eleanor (Vera Farmiga) to the station's annual ball, but has to leave for a stake-out with co-worker Claire Maddox (Kelly Macdonald). Eleanor then meets Frank, who sleeps with her, unaware she is married to Finch. The following day, Mallard puts Frank on a story about an uprising in Ecuador, and assigns Finch to accompany him. However, Finch tells Frank he can't go as Eleanor has left him. He also says he's written a letter, begging her not to end their marriage.
Finch later changes his mind about Ecuador, and he and Frank pack for their trip. At the airport, the two realize Finch has accidentally thrown their passports and plane tickets in a garbage truck. Frank and Finch return to the city and hide out at a café owned by Spanish couple Brigida and Domingo (America Ferrera and Raúl Castillo), located across the street from the radio station. With Brigida and Domingo's help, Frank and Finch fake their war reports in the couple's spare room.
After Finch and Frank decide they need to cover a bigger story, they invent a man named Emilio Santiago Alvarez, whom they claim is elusive and closely linked to the war. This report alerts the U.S. government, who now believe that Frank and Finch are targets for Alvarez's men. Meanwhile, Frank and Finch watch as other media outlets report on Alvarez, including their TV rival John Baker (Benjamin Bratt). Mallard calls Frank, asking for the two men to go to the U.S. embassy in Quito, where they will then be flown home. Panicking that they'll be found out, Frank and Finch destroy their SIM cards so they cannot be traced.
The next morning, Frank fails to check in with Mallard, worrying the station. The media begins reporting about Finch and Frank's disappearance. Claire visits Eleanor to offer her sympathy, but Eleanor seems more interested in getting her story out. Frank and Finch stage a hostage situation, and send out a message to the President, asking for a ransom or they will be executed. Later, Frank and Finch watch as Eleanor appears on TV. This prompts Frank to find out about her identity as Finch's wife. She then performs a song, ""Dollar for a Hero"", appealing for their safe return.
Eleanor subsequently becomes a national sensation and sets up a charity for Finch and Frank. Mallard asks Claire to get to know Eleanor, who is using her husband's plight so she can start a singing career. Finch accepts Eleanor's selfishness in the situation and says he's no longer upset that she left him. On Finch's birthday, he admits he can't keep up the charade any longer. Finch and Frank stop off at his apartment to take some of the donated money, but Eleanor catches them. The three decide to split the cash so they can all get what they want. Frank and Finch drive cross-country and sail illegally to Ecuador. They hitch a ride to Quito from a local, but first stop off at a rundown bar. There, they are held at gunpoint and taken to a small village, where they are locked up. Thinking they're going to die, Frank admits to Finch that he slept with Eleanor.
The next morning, the captors demand ransom from Eleanor but she refuses and tells them to kill Frank and Finch. When a captor returns, planning for them to fight to the death, Frank steals his gun and Finch ends up shooting him. They escape by stealing a car, make it to the U.S. embassy, and are flown home on a private jet. On returning home, they are greeted by the Secretary of State, press, friends and family. Frank makes a speech, and Finch bypasses Eleanor to greet Domingo and Brigida. Eleanor then speaks to press about her upcoming album, while Finch takes off his wedding ring. He approaches Claire, whom he realizes likes him for who he is. The pair happily walk off towards the city together."
Florence Foster Jenkins,"Florence Foster Jenkins (Meryl Streep) is a New York City heiress and socialite who founded the Verdi Club to celebrate her passionate love of music. As it is 1944 and the U.S. is in the midst of World War II, Florence is of the opinion that ""music matters more than ever."" St. Clair Bayfield (Hugh Grant), a British Shakespearean actor, is her husband and manager. Despite being married, Florence and Bayfield live in separate residences. She lives in a grand hotel suite while he resides in an apartment in the city with his secret mistress, Kathleen Weatherley (Rebecca Ferguson). Florence suffers from a long-term case of syphilis, which she contracted from her first husband. The illness has caused her to have various health problems for which she takes medication, including mercury and arsenic, that have toxic side effects. Due to the fear of passing the disease on to Bayfield, she remains abstinent from all sexual intercourse in her marriage, and Bayfield has sex with Kathleen.
Florence decides to resume her long-neglected singing lessons. She hires pianist Cosmé McMoon (Simon Helberg) and introduces him to her vocal coach, Carlo Edwards (David Haig), the assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera. McMoon is shocked that Florence is a terrible singer, yet Bayfield and Edwards pretend she is wonderful, with the former giving McMoon a dire warning against criticizing her.
Bayfield arranges a small recital, hand-picking the attendees. On the night of the performance, loyal Verdi Club members watch respectfully, but others can barely contain their laughter. Feeling encouraged by her recital’s good reviews, she makes a recording as a Christmas gift for the Verdi Club. Florence gives McMoon a copy, which leads to her recalling that Bayfield was an unsuccessful actor and that she hid negative reviews from him. She also informs McMoon of her history as a piano player and teacher, having once played for the President as a child. McMoon realizes that Florence is not as musically inept as he had thought, strengthening their friendship.
Florence and McMoon write and perform original songs together, one of which gets airtime on the radio, much to the shock and horror of Bayfield and Kathleen, despite many listeners enjoying it, believing it to be comedic. With this burst in popularity, Florence informs Bayfield that she has booked Carnegie Hall for a one night performance and will give away a thousand tickets to soldiers. Bayfield fails to dissuade her. Bayfield stressed over the impending performance, gets into a fight with a group of men laughing at Florence and McMoon's song at a bar. Kathleen, resenting the lack of attention, leaves Bayfield. McMoon confides to Bayfield that he fears that the recital will humiliate him and ruin his career. Bayfield replies that he gave up his acting career to support his wife and urges McMoon to possibly do the same for the sake of his friend. McMoon agrees, elated to at least play at Carnegie Hall.
The concert is packed and attended by the likes of Cole Porter and Tallulah Bankhead. When Florence begins singing, the soldiers laugh and jeer. Her supporters and loyal friends, however, scold them and then cheer for her to keep singing. She happily continues her performance. Meanwhile, the columnist Earl Wilson for the New York Post refuses to continue listening, telling a desperate Bayfield that he will write a damning review of the recital.
Bayfield, with McMoon's help, goes to great lengths so that she only receives good reviews by buying every copy of the New York Post in the vicinity and throwing them away. After being given sarcastically patronizing comments about her performance alluding to the New York Post's review by a pair of young men, Florence is driven to find a copy of the review in a trash can and is upset to the point of collapse. As she is dying in bed, Bayfield by her side, Florence remembers a fancy angel costume worn for the concert as an angel and imagines herself singing beautiful opera.[6] She imagines that she, McMoon and Bayfield all take a triumphant bow to a standing ovation. She points out proudly that even though people can say she could not sing, no one can say she did not sing. Peacefully, she dies."
Golden Years,"Law-abiding retired couple, Arthur (Hill) and Martha Goode (McKenna) live a quiet life in suburbia, tending their garden and socialising with friends. The pensions crisis and a steadfast refusal to accept the injustice of old age force Arthur and Martha into a life of crime. Refusing to take the loss of their pensions lying down and to fade away into their declining years, they decide to fight back and take back what was theirs in the first place. They decide to start robbing banks to recover their money. With masks to hide their identities and canvas shopping trolleys to transport their loot, they embark on a whistle-stop tour of countryside bank branches within easy reach of National Trust properties, which they tour in a caravan. The media reports the banks robberies and assumes the heists to be conducted by a young crew of professionals. The notoriety of the Goodes grows as more banks are targeted, including a narrow escape when, after robbing a village bank and hiding their masks, they are invited back into the branch for a cup of tea by bank manager Stephen, played by Richard Cambridge. Soon, their drinking buddies Royston (Callow), Shirley (Stubbs), Brian (Davis), whom they know from their failing bingo and bowls club, managed by Mark Williams, discover their identities and choose to join the gang, enabling more daring heists at High Street bank branch vaults. Meanwhile, they remain one step ahead of policeman Sid (Armstrong) and his wife Nancy, played by Sue Johnston and CID officer Stringer, played by Brad Moore.[4][5]"
Our Kind of Traitor,"As part of a plan to launder billions of dollars in London, ""the Prince"" – the head of the Russian Mafia – creates a new bank and has its financial oligarchs sign over their accounts to him. The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin.
Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to British MI6 when he returns to London.
Perry turns the information over to Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and Aubrey Longrigg, a senior politician whom Hector knows is corrupt, although he has never been able to prove it. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of the corrupt, and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Aubrey Longrigg receiving £10 million plus an additional £20 million for every politician or banker he personally recruited to the cause. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption, until he and his family have been granted asylum in London.
Emilio, the Prince's consigliere, suspects the MacKendricks and has henchman Niki intimidate them by bringing them to his rough neighbourhood. While there, the blue-eyed assassin beats a woman and Perry attacks him in fury. Gail is touched by her husband's protectiveness of others and their relationship begins to heal. Hector reveals to the MacKendricks that he only has two men and that he has been funding the operation himself, and they plan to seize Dima and his family simultaneously after Dima has signed the accounts over to the bank. Gail successfully retrieves Dima's wife and children, and Dima kills Niki before Perry can find him and bring him to safety.
While at the airport with the family about to board a charter plane back to London, Billy calls Hector and informs him that Aubrey Longrigg has convinced the Home Office the family be denied asylum. With their plan thwarted, Hector must return to London alone. The MacKendricks refuse to leave Dima and the family until the asylum is granted and they are safe in London.
Given the MacKendricks' involvement, Hector sends everyone to a safehouse in the French Alps. While there, Dima's daughter blows their cover by calling one of Dima's bodyguards, Andrei, by whom she is pregnant. Andrei traces the location of the call and the blue-eyed assassin leads an attack on the safehouse, but it is fended off by Dima and the agents. Dima chases the blue-eyed assassin into the woods, but is ambushed and almost beaten to death before Perry arrives and kills the assassin.
Meanwhile, Hector has returned to London and attempted to convince the UK Treasury Office that the Prince's bank is a cover to launder billions of dirty Russian mafia money in London. He succeeds, but for asylum to be granted to Dima and his family, he must provide proof in the form of all the account numbers and names of the corrupt UK politicians and bankers involved in endorsing the bank—the detail that Dima still has in his head.
A deal is made that Dima must be sent to London first by helicopter, with his family to follow once the account information he has memorised has been verified. The attack at the safe house and his wife's insistence convinces Dima to go on ahead and Perry volunteers to accompany him.
The family and Gail are driven to another safe house while Dima, Perry and Hector's agent head to the helicopter rendezvous location. At the last minute, Dima insists Perry not come with him on the helicopter. As Perry watches the helicopter take off it explodes over the Alps, killing Dima and Hector's agent and devastating the MacKendricks and Hector. All is lost.
The mafia bank opens in London and begins trading at massive profit; Aubrey Longrigg is announced as the new Minister of State for Trade and Investment.
Dima's family receives asylum after all, arranged by Hector as compensation for Dima's murder while under his protection. Perry visits Hector at home and gives him a gift from Dima, a box containing the ornate pistol that the Prince had given Dima upon the signing of the accounts. After Perry leaves, Hector finds a tiny roll of paper addressed to him from Dima with the list of all the corrupt Britons' names and account numbers hidden in the pistol's chamber. With this information, Hector is able to expose the Prince's money laundering network and the role of Longrigg and the other politicians within it."
"I, Daniel Blake","Widower Daniel Blake, a 59-year-old joiner living in Newcastle, has had a heart attack at work. Though his cardiologist has not allowed him to return to work, Daniel is deemed fit to do so after a work capability assessment and denied employment and support allowance. He is frustrated to learn that his doctor was not contacted about the decision, and applies for an appeal, a process he finds difficult because he must complete forms online and is not computer literate.
Daniel befriends single mother Katie after she is sanctioned for arriving late for a jobcentre appointment. Katie and her children have just moved to Newcastle from a London homeless persons' hostel, as there is no affordable accommodation available in London. Daniel helps the family by repairing objects, teaching them how to heat rooms without electricity and crafting wooden toys for the children.
During a visit to a food bank, Katie is overcome by hunger and breaks down. After she is caught shoplifting at a supermarket, a security guard offers her work as a prostitute. Daniel surprises her at the brothel, where he begs her to give up the job, but she tearfully insists she has no other choice to feed her children.
As a condition for receiving jobseeker's allowance, Daniel must keep looking for work. He refuses a job at a scrapyard because his doctor will not allow him to work yet. When Daniel's work coach tells him he must work harder to find a job or be sanctioned, Daniel spraypaints ""I, Daniel Blake, demand my appeal date before I starve"" on the building. He earns the support of passersby, including other benefits claimants, but is arrested and warned by the police. Daniel sells most of his belongings and becomes withdrawn.
On the day of Daniel's appeal, Katie accompanies him to court. A welfare adviser tells Daniel that his case looks sound. On glimpsing the judge and doctor who will decide his case, Daniel becomes anxious and visits the lavatory, where he suffers a heart attack and dies. At his public health funeral, Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at his appeal. The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society."
Kill Command,"In a technologically advanced near future, Katherine Mills, a cyborg working for Harbinger Corporation, discovers a reprogramming anomaly regarding a warfare A.I. system located at Harbinger I Training Facility, an undisclosed military training island. She meets with Captain Damien Bukes and his team consisting of Drifter, Robinson, Cutbill, Goodwin, Hackett, and Loftus – all of whom have been assigned to a two-day training mission at Harbinger I.
Upon their arrival, the team notices global communications have been disabled, limiting them to local access only. They discover autonomously operating surveillance drones monitoring them. The team begins their mission of eliminating A.I. threats. The first encounter proves easy for the team as they eliminate A.I. drones from a vantage point. During the battle, Mills discovers an advanced S.A.R. (Study Analyze Reprogram) unit, S.A.R.-003, but is unable to access it.
That night, Drifter and Mills discuss their pasts and Bukes' disdain for her. Later that night, Loftus is killed by the S.A.R. unit. The next day, they discover Loftus's body at the location of the first encounter. The drones take the team's original vantage point and kill Hackett. They discover the A.I. is adapting and learning from them. Bukes flanks two drones, which immediately disperse. Later, the S.A.R. unit captures Cutbill and has him shot and killed by another drone. The drones attack the group again and Bukes and Mills are separated from Drifter, Robinson and Goodwin. That night, the S.A.R. unit discovers Bukes and an unconscious Mills; it ""connects"" with Mills and leaves.
The next day the team attempts to exit the training area, but they are attacked by smoke and gunfire. Drifter is shot and pinned down by the S.A.R. unit. Bukes kills Drifter as a coup de grace before the S.A.R. unit is able to. The team escapes into the barrier complex and discovers that the A.I. has killed all of the employees. Mills activates another S.A.R. unit to learn that S.A.R-003 reprogrammed the A.I. to use lethal force to improve soldier motivation and has ordered the soldiers to Harbinger I on its own. S.A.R-003 and other units break through the barrier door as the remaining team escapes through the back. Mills discovers an EMP device which can be used to stop the original S.A.R. unit but could also kill her or wipe her mind clean.
Bukes, Mills, Robinson, and Goodwin place explosives to prepare for a siege. The following day, A.I. drones attack the facility. The team wipes out more than half of the drones, but Robinson is killed in the ensuing gunfight. As S.A.R-003 approaches the team, Mills detonates the EMP, incapacitating herself and the drone. The S.A.R. unit reawakens and attacks Bukes and Mills. Mills controls Robinson's sniper rifle gun in the building to destroy the S.A.R. unit; S.A.R. however uploads its program into Mills before it shuts down and Mills loses consciousness. Hours later, a tiltrotor arrives to rescue the survivors. As Bukes and Goodwin approaches the aircraft, Mills reawakens with S.A.R-003's mission protocol."
American Honey,"Star (Sasha Lane) is a teenager living in Muskogee, Oklahoma. She takes care of two younger children while being sexually assaulted by their father (Johnny Pierce II). While trying to hitchhike home she spies a car full of teenagers and makes eye contact with Jake (Shia LaBeouf), one of the boys.
She follows them to a local K-Mart, and returns Jake's phone after it falls out of his pocket. He kisses her on the cheek and tells her to come with him to Kansas, where he will offer her a job. Star declines but Jake nevertheless tells her to meet them in the parking lot of the local Motel 6.
Star changes her mind. Packing her belongings, she takes the children she watches to the club where their mother (Chasity Hunsaker) dances, telling her it is her turn to care for them. Though the mother refuses, Star runs away from the club and sleeps outside the van of the strangers till morning.
Jake is delighted that she came. She is interviewed by Krystal, who runs the entire crew, and who hires her after she establishes that Star is 18, no one will miss her, and that Star promises to work hard.
In the car on the way to Kansas, Star meets the other members of the crew including Pagan (Arielle Holmes) who is obsessed with Star Wars, in particular Darth Vader, and death.
The crew breaks up into groups of two to sell magazines door to door. Since Star is new, she is paired with Jake, the veteran of the group. Star finds it difficult to sell as Jake lies to a potential customer (Laura Kirk) in order to make sales. She also distracts Jake by flirting and eventually kissing him.
Krystal calls Star in, and tells her that Jake has posted his lowest sales ever. She has Jake put tanning lotion on her body as Star watches. Star promises to improve.
The following day, annoyed by Jake, Star vows to outsell him. She is picked up by three strangers in cowboy hats who offer to help her, thinking she is being harassed by Jake. They bring her to their home and offer to buy several magazines if she drinks the worm at the bottom of a bottle of mezcal. Star does, and makes the sale. Jake however, fearing the worst, arrives and threatens the men with a gun before stealing their car. Initially angry at Jake, Star is later touched that he came to find her and the two have sex. When they return to the hotel for the evening, Jake tells her not to mention their relationship, and then gives the money Star earned to Krystal.
For a while things between Jake and Star are tense, and Krystal threatens to drop her on the side of the road if she keeps causing trouble. The crew ends up living temporarily in a rundown house, and Jake and Star renew their relationship. She asks him what his dreams are, and he shows her his private stash of cash and gold, items he's stolen from the houses he visits, which he intends to use to buy a home.
Krystal dumps the girls off where oil workers are about to go to work in the morning. Star climbs in the back of their truck and tries to sell them magazines, but one of the oil workers tells her he'll pay her five hundred dollars to go on a date with him. Star asks for a thousand, and prostitutes herself for the money. After the man drops her off she hears him being attacked. Shortly after, a bloodied Jake asks her if she was hurt by the man and later asks if she slept with him. He throws a fit, smashing the belongings in the house before running off.
The following morning the crew get in the car and there is a new girl there, while Jake is missing. Krystal calls Star to her room and informs her she has let Jake go and that she paid him money for each girl he recruited and that he slept with all of them. Krystal later takes them to a poor area in Rapid City, South Dakota, to sell magazines. Star enters a house and meets several affable children whose mother is on drugs. As Star's own mother died of meth she feels sympathetic towards them, and goes out to buy them groceries. At the pickup that day Jake is in the van and Star is confused as to whether to be happy to see him or not.
That evening the crew light a bonfire and celebrate. Dancing around the fire Star is pulled aside by Jake who privately hands her a turtle. Star takes it to the edge of the water and releases it before following the turtle into the water. She immerses herself fully before rising out of the water."
Loving,"Richard Loving, a white construction worker in Caroline County, Virginia, falls in love with a local black woman and family friend, Mildred Jeter. Upon Mildred discovering that she is pregnant, they decide to marry, but knowing that interracial marriage violates Virginia's anti-miscegenation laws, they drive to Washington, D.C. to get married in 1958. Richard makes plans to build a house for Mildred less than a mile from her family home.
Soon afterward, sheriff's deputies raid Mildred's home and arrest the Lovings. When Richard points to the marriage license, Sheriff Brooks curtly tells him that it has no validity in Virginia and hauls them both to jail. They plead guilty to breaking the anti-miscegenation law and are sentenced to one year in prison. However, the judge suspends the sentence, on condition that they not return to Virginia together for at least 25 years. The Lovings move to Washington to stay with a friend of Mildred's. They briefly return to Caroline County so their first child, Sidney, can be delivered by Richard's mother, a midwife. Arrested again, they are cleared when their lawyer says he erroneously advised them they could return.
Mildred and Richard have two other children together, Donald and Peggy. However, Mildred grows frustrated by being away from the country, and her frustration grows when she watches the March on Washington. She writes to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for help. Kennedy refers them to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lawyer Bernard S. Cohen takes the case and confers with constitutional law expert Phil Hirschkop.[28] They conclude that the Lovings' ordeal has a good chance of going all the way to the Supreme Court - and overturning similar anti-miscegenation laws across the nation.
After a minor auto accident involving one of their children, the Lovings decide to slip back into Virginia, settling in a remote portion of King and Queen County while their case moves through the courts. Their case gains wide attention, and is profiled in Life magazine by photographer Grey Villet (fr).[29][30] The state contends that people of different races were never intended to live together, and goes as far as to suggest the Lovings' children are bastards. The state Supreme Court refuses to set aside the Lovings' conviction. Undeterred, Cohen and Hirschkop appeal to the federal Supreme Court. Before going to Washington, Cohen asks Richard if he has a message for the justices. Richard replies, ""Tell them that I love my wife.""
Several weeks later, the Supreme Court unanimously holds that laws prohibiting interracial marriage are unconstitutional. The film ends with the Lovings back in Caroline County, working on their dream house. Richard dies in a car accident in 1975, while Mildred continues to live in the house Richard built for her until her death in 2008."
Me Before You,"26-year-old Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) is a happy, outgoing woman who lives with and supports her working-class family. After losing her job at a local cafe, she is hired as the caregiver of Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), a former successful banker and once active young man who became paralyzed after being involved in a motorcycle accident two years prior. Louisa has no experience but Will's mother believes her cheery personality will help lift his spirits. Will only spends time with Nathan, his nurse, who assists with his care, exercise and movement and knows that he will never regain use of his body due to the damage to his spinal cord.
Cynical and depressed because he can no longer live an active life, Will initially reacts coldly to Louisa's upbeat demeanor and treats her with contempt. After two weeks, Will has a visit from his former best friend Rupert and ex-girlfriend Alicia who reveal that they are engaged. Will manages to smash all the photographs on his dresser in anger and indignation, which Louisa tries to repair the next day, leading to a verbal altercation during which Louisa chastises him for ""being an arse"". The next day, Will asks Louisa to watch a film with subtitles with him, and she accepts. The two begin to bond and eventually become close friends. Louisa and Will continue to talk daily; she learns that he is cultured and worldly, having traveled extensively. In contrast, her life so far has been simple, without many interests or hobbies or travel away from home. Her long-term boyfriend, Patrick (Matthew Lewis), is training to take part in a Viking triathlon in Norway, a hobby that he often chooses over spending time with her. Will urges Louisa to broaden her horizons and tells her that it's her responsibility to live life as fully as possible.
While taking care of him during one of his occasional illnesses, Louisa notices Will's scarred wrists from a previous suicide attempt. While at work one day, Louisa overhears an argument of Will's parents and she learns that Will has given his parents six months before checking in to Dignitas in Switzerland for assisted suicide. Will refuses to accept life with a disability that entails dependency, pain and suffering without any hope for recovery of his old self. Louisa then takes it upon herself to change his mind. She organizes various trips and adventures to show Will that life is worth living, despite his disability. Will gradually becomes more communicative and open to her plans. The pair attends the horse-racing, with disastrous consequences and a few days afterwards, goes to a Mozart concert. Will then decides to attend Alicia's wedding and asks Louisa to accompany him. At the wedding, Louisa and Will enjoy offending the straight-laced guests. Louisa learns from the bride's godmother that she considers Will to be Alicia's 'one that got away'.
Will joins Louisa's family for dinner on her birthday, where they learn that Louisa's father had lost his job in a leveraged buyout that happened to have been organized by a younger associate of Will. Shortly thereafter Louisa's father is offered the head of maintenance job at Stortfold Castle which belongs to Will's family and Louisa realizes that Will is trying to help her secure her freedom from her family. Gradually they develop strong feelings for one another, which makes Patrick jealous and causes problems in Louisa's long-standing relationship, leading to their break-up.
During a luxurious trip to the island of Mauritius together, undertaken after another bout with pneumonia and with help from Will's nurse, Will informs Louisa that he still intends to follow through with the euthanasia. He wants her to live a full life instead of ""half a life"" with him. He says their time together has been special, but he cannot bear to live in a wheelchair. He asks her to accompany him to Switzerland to be with him through his last moments. Heartbroken, she informs Will's parents upon arrival in London that she is quitting immediately and travels back to her home by bus. She does not speak to Will for the days that follow. However, at home, Louisa's father convinces her to go to Will in Switzerland. She finds out that he has already left for Switzerland, and decides to go to Switzerland herself to be with Will in his final moments.
A few weeks after Will's death, sitting in his favorite cafe in Paris, she rereads the letter Will left for her. In it he encourages her to seek out a specific perfume shop and ends off the letter with 'just live', which she can afford to do because he has left her enough money to follow her dreams."
100 Streets,The film centers on three characters who have to meet in London for special reasons and under unlikely circumstances.
Tommy's Honour,"In St Andrews, Scotland in 1866, 15-year-old Tommy Morris (Jack Lowden) is an avid golfer like his legendary and pioneering father, Tom Morris (Peter Mullan). ""Old Tom"" is greens-keeper for The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, as well as the town’s club- and ball-maker. He is the two-time winner of the first major golf tournament, The Open Championship, which he founded in 1860. He also established golf's standard of 18 holes per round. But young Tommy is beginning to chafe at his father's dictates, especially in the rapidly changing world they live in.
Tommy soon outshines his father, winning The Open three times in a row while still in his teens. The ""dashing young man of golf"", he draws flocks of spectators to the sport and becomes its first touring professional.
Father and son repeatedly clash over the unwritten rules of social class, and this culminates when Tommy marries his sweetheart Meg (Ophelia Lovibond), a woman of lower standing with a shameful secret in her past. As the story concludes, Old Tom makes a fatal misjudgement that strips Tommy of everything he holds dear. Following the results of that fateful choice, Old Tom takes on a personal mission that carries him through the final decades of his life: that of honouring his son Tommy."
The White King,"The film follows Djata (Lorenzo Allchurch), a 12-year-old boy growing up in a dystopian territory, called Homeland, under a dictatorship and without access to the rest of the world. His father, Peter (Ross Partridge), tells him of the true nature of Homeland as well as of a treasure guarded by a man named Pickaxe (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson). Peter is later taken away by two government agents, leading to him and Djata's mother Hannah (Agyness Deyn) being labelled traitors by the government and the citizenry alike as Djata works to discover the whereabouts of his father."
Kids in Love,"Jack (Will Poulter) is a gap-year student in London who isn’t convinced that he wants the life that has been mapped out for him. He meets a young woman (Alma Jodorowsky), who introduces him to the bohemian side of the city."
Whisky Galore!,"In 1943, on the small remote island of Todday (pronounced ""toddy""), 100 miles to the west of Scotland in the Hebrides, World War II largely passes by the small population that barely notices the effects of rationing until Mr Bain, the barman at the only pub, announces ""There is no more whisky. [clap of thunder] The island is dry."" It is too much for one elderly man who dies after downing the last whisky in his glass; at his funeral, with there being no whisky, his friends can only bid him farewell with a cup of tea.
Next day the supply ship captain brings no whisky and says the islanders' quotas are cancelled. The islanders are dejected. Only Mrs Campbell is unmoved by the whisky drought - a fierce and domineering Bible-basher who strictly controls and constantly berates her adult son George (the schoolmaster), regularly locking him in his room with only a Bible and bread and cheese. She disapproves of his courtship of Catriona, daughter of widower Joseph Macroon who is the postmaster. The supply ship's captain unloads a case of ammunition which Captain Cyril Waggett, who leads the handful of men forming the island's Home Guard, says is the wrong sort for his soldiers' rifles. Waggett is obliged to hold onto the case, which he has stored in the island post office (which encompasses the telephone exchange and shop). Mr Brown, a mainlander, ostensibly a tweed salesman, also arrives on the supply ship; he encounters local distrust (asking for directions to the public phone box, he is told he'll surely come to it if he turns left, or right).
Macroon's other daughter, Peggy, operates the telephone exchange. She is delighted when her boyfriend Sergeant Donald Odd returns on the supply ship, on leave from the War, having recently fought with the army in Africa and fought in the Battle of El Alamein. Macroon, however, sadly realises that when his daughters marry soon, they will leave his house and the island, leaving him alone.
The islanders endure two weeks of whisky ""drought"" during which ""morale is very very low"". During a stormy night, the freighter S.S. Cabinet Minister runs aground on the rocks of Skerry Dhu near Todday and starts to sink. Biffer and Sammy row out to investigate and learn from its departing crew, commanded by Captain Buncher, that the cargo consists of various items bound for the United States but all the two islanders focus on is its 50,000 cases of whisky (""12 bottles in each case!"" Biffer notes before thanking God). They house the stricken ship's crew in Ma McPhee's Boarding House (the crew later leaves for the mainland) then the islanders prepare to row out to fetch ashore the whisky. But as the church clock starts to toll midnight, the church minister, Macalister, loudly reminds them that the Sabbath has begun. As no work is allowed on the holy Sabbath, everyone despondently goes home.
During the day, a number of islanders stand on the harbour and nearby cliffs looking out at the sinking ship. Waggett is concerned to uphold the law and prevent thievery, so he orders Sergeant Odd, his next in command, to keep watch on the ship from ashore. Macroon tells Odd that there can be no wedding between Odd and Peggy without a rèiteach (betrothal ceremony) beforehand, and a reiteach requires whisky - no whisky, no reiteach, no wedding. Three of the Home Guard recruits try to sneak up on Odd to incapacitate him; Odd colludes with them and is left tied up and gagged, obviously unable to stop anyone from boarding the ship. Macroon learns from an overheard telephone call that the cargo includes a valuable red leather document case.
As soon as midnight starts tolling (Monday) and once Odd is incapacitated, many of the island's men, accompanied by Peggy, make haste to board the Cabinet Minister. This includes George who, locked in his bedroom by his mother, sneaks out of his bedroom window and jumps down. They bring ashore many but not all the crates of whisky before they have to abandon the ship when it sinks. Macroon sneaks ashore the document case that he found, hidden inside a whisky case. They load the crates onto Biffer and Sammy's lorry, pausing only at Macalister's behest as they praise God for his bounty. They take the crates to a cave at Seal Bay, stash the crates there and take away many bottles for immediate or imminent consumption.
The adult population live it up in the pub as the stolen whisky flows freely, and there is dancing and music. Mr Bain is annoyed that he cannot charge his customers (Sammy assures him he will be robbing them again soon enough), and later Bain informs Waggett that there are 200 cases of looted whisky on the island. On Bain's further information, Waggett goes to Seal Bay and sees the stashed crates for himself.
The documents in the red case comprise love letters written by the Duke of Windsor to his wife (known as Wallis Simpson before they married in 1936). The Duke is considered an embarrassment to the Establishment due to his undisguised admiration for Hitler and Nazism. Macroon, who has realised who or what Mr Brown is, contacts him and gives him the document case on condition that Brown's official report to the government will give a glowing report on the inept Waggett, in the hope that he will not be replaced by someone ""more efficient.""
At the reiteach, a quaich containing whisky is passed along for everyone to drink, and speeches are made to honour the forthcoming weddings of Odd and Peggy and of Catriona and George. As the whisky flows, Macalister announces (with Constable McPhee beside him) that he will conduct the marriage ceremonies on the solstice. Wild celebrations ensue, with much downing of whisky. George imbibes heavily, and Catriona hopes the alcohol will give him the courage necessary to insist on the wedding to his mother. It does, and George gives his mother an ultimatum - either accept Catriona or ""emigrate to Glasgow""; she is appalled that he is drunk on ""Satan's drink"" but when she tries to chastise him he plays the bagpipes at her.
Waggett rings Peggy at the telephone exchange and asks her to ensure that the case of ordnance is put aboard the next supply ship. Later, knowing that Peggy reports useful news she overhears while connecting phone calls, Waggett gets her to put through his call to his superior officer Woolsey, pretending he will travel to Obaig to meet him to discuss the said ordnance. However, Waggett actually goes to Nobast to fetch Farquharson, a Customs & Excise officer. Farquharson has had run-ins with Macroon before, and his men search his house, with Constable McPhee checking the upper floor. But the Macroons have been warned by a grateful Mr Brown and by a local named Roddy, and Farquharson finds nothing. The whisky has been poured into ingenious hiding places such as the cold water tank (and islanders are busy hiding it in walls, gutters etc), and the ordnance has been secretly removed from the case and replaced by bottles of whisky. Waggett sees the ordnance case and sharply reminds Peggy to at once put it out for the imminent supply ship and Constable McPhee says he will see to it. Farquharson tells Waggett go by car while he sails the customs boat to Seal Bay - he and McPhee will seize the whisky crates and the remaining whisky. Macroon, his daughters, George, Biffer and Sammy realise the destination when Mr Bain admits that he had told Waggett to look at Seal Bay. Macroon's daughters delay Waggett by boxing in his parked car while Angus cycles around telling everyone to rush to Seal Bay. The men, including Macroon, George, Biffer and Sammy, hurry to Seal Bay along the beach in the latter's lorry, which the islanders load with the whisky crates. Farquharson and Waggett find only an empty cave. On the return journey the lorry runs out of fuel and they empty two bottles of whisky into the fuel tank, which enables them to once again put distance between themselves and the pursuing Farquharson. But they leave behind the two used bottles, which Farquharson and Waggett find, proving to Farquharson that Waggett's story is true. Angus stops their car on the road, and points his Home Guard rifle at them, declaring that the Nazis may have invaded and, countering Waggett's indignation, that someone may be impersonating Waggett. He demands the password, but they do not know it. Farquharson mentions whisky in conversation with Waggett. Angus says ""whisky"" is the correct password and stands aside. Farquharson soon has the whisky-laden lorry in sight but the narrow road is obstructed by a number of islanders on bicycles (those who moved the whisky from Seal Bay, and led by Peggy and Odd) who decline to make way, and the lorry escapes.
At Waggett's house, his wife Dolly pours tea for Farquharson, Waggett and McPhee. Farquharson phones a report to his superiors. He then informs Waggett, with some relish, that he has been ordered to take Waggett to Obaig for interrogation, because he sent a case there which contained bottles of whisky identified as coming from the S.S. Cabinet Minister. From his personal share of the looted whisky McPhee pours two drams for Waggett and his wife to bid farewell to each other with.
After Farquharson's and Waggett's departure, the joint wedding of the Macroon daughters is held, celebrated by the whole island. The two brides emerge from the marriage ceremony through a guard of honour holding crossed whisky bottles above them. Even Mrs Campbell eventually arrives to signify her belated approval of George's and Catriona's marriage; she is given a whisky dram and surreptitiously drinks it and later on joins in the country dancing. Mr Bain is denied a dance by a woman in return for his informing about the whisky but, forgiven by all, joins in a country dance later. Catriona and Peggy have a moment with their father, assuring him that they love him and that it is him that makes the day."
Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,"The ever-glamorous and self-indulgent Edina and Patsy are now in their 60s, and Edina is still running her PR agency, which is quickly running out of money and interest. The duo realise that Edina needs a miracle to save her PR company and renew her reputation.
Bubble wakes up a hungover Edina, who has come home from a fashion event. Edina realises that she signs a deal for an autobiography that day. Edina wakes Patsy up and tells her about her book, and how it will be ""made into a film because it's about her life"", whilst Patsy self-applies Botox. The company head (Mark Gatiss) rejects Edina's book because it is lazily written and there is little interest in Edina's PR agency. While Patsy is setting up designer Huki Muki's fashion event, Patsy learns that supermodel Kate Moss is changing her PR, and immediately informs Edina. Patsy phones whilst Edina is at a PR meeting with rival PR Claudia Bing (Celia Imrie) and during the phone call with Patsy she accidentally leaves her phone on ""speaker"" and Claudia learns that Kate Moss needs a new PR.
Edina and Patsy go to the fashion event with Edina's granddaughter Lola while Saffron ""Saffy"" Monsoon, Edina's daughter and Lola's mother, has a night out with her new boyfriend Nick (Robert Webb). Edina finds Kate Moss on the balcony overlooking the Thames. As she moves to speak to her, she notices that Claudia is also heading for her. Rushing to get to Kate first, Edina accidentally bumps into her and she falls off the balcony and into the Thames.
Hysteria pervades the event as Kate is presumed dead. The media immediately storms the scene to report her disappearance and assumed death. Edina and Patsy, along with Lola, are taken into police custody. Saffy arrives to see them and make sure Lola is all right.
Edina returns home the next day. Patsy arrives angry; she's been fired from her job because of her association with Edina and the previous night's events. The pair make up and return to the Thames to look for Kate, using Bubble with a flashing beacon upon her head to simulate and retrace how Moss may have been carried away, but the beacon comes loose and unable to find Bubble, they presume her dead, too. They decide to flee before the media firestorm gets worse, taking Lola and her credit card along. The three land in Cannes while Saffy desperately searches for Lola or clues to her whereabouts back in London, finally consulting Christopher (Chris Colfer), Edina's friend and stylist.
In Cannes, Edina and Patsy call upon Patsy's ex-lover, billionaire Charlie (Barry Humphries). After Charlie rejects them, they seek help from Edina's mother (June Whitfield), who is celebrating her cousin Violet's birthday. During this party, they encounter the Richest Woman in the World. To attract the Woman and get quick money, Patsy quickly changes her identity to a male alter-ego, ""Pat"" Stone. The following day, Patsy marries the Rich Woman and Edina and Patsy find the wealth they were looking for as they stay in a high-class hotel with Dame Joan Collins and Dame Edna Everage as fellow guests.
Meanwhile, Edina and Patsy are seen in public by Emma Bunton who tells Lulu about their whereabouts. Saffy arrives in Cannes with Nick and immediately heads to the hotel to find Lola. Lola is with Emma who tells Saffy of Edina's whereabouts, even though it is the least of Saffy's concerns. Lulu flies out to Cannes and meets with Bubble, who reveals that Kate just swam off and did not drown in the Thames. Bubble also reveals that she is also a millionaire and owns a massive Cannes pavilion because she has had control of Eddie's accounts for years, and has been embezzling from the company.
Lulu reports Edina and Patsy's whereabouts to the police, since her only desire is to destroy Edina for what she has done. The police find Edina and Patsy and chase them through the town, the duo escaping in a small three-wheeled fish-market van. As they reach Bubble's pavilion, the van's brakes fail and they roll backwards and fall into an infinity pool attached to Bubble's house. Saffy arrives at the scene to find Edina and Patsy slowly sinking into the pool, still inside the van. Edina apologises to Saffy for being a careless mother and wishes to drown in the pool, and to finally embrace the fact that she is old and can't run from justice forever. Saffy tells her that she loves her. Bubble reveals that Kate Moss didn't drown in the Thames, and Edina immediately exits the van, realizing she's innocent.
A montage plays of countries celebrating that Kate Moss is still alive and that Edina is her new PR. Edina's PR agency is renewed, and Kate is in even more demand now that she has been found. The film finishes with Patsy revealing to her rich wife that she isn't actually a man called ""Pat"" and is really a woman. Her wife reveals that she is actually a man and the film closes with the series's popular theme song, ""This Wheel's on Fire"" sung by Kylie Minogue."
Anthropoid,"It is December 1941, near the height of Nazi occupation in Europe. Two agents from the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, a Slovak soldier, Jozef Gabčík (Cillian Murphy) and a Czech, Jan Kubiš (Jamie Dornan) are parachuted into their occupied homeland. Jozef is injured when he crashes through a tree upon landing, but both men set out to find their contact in Czechoslovakia. They are discovered shortly after by two resistance fighters who turn out to be traitors; one is shot by Jozef but the other man escapes. Stealing their truck, the agents head for Prague.
When they seek out their contact, they are directed to Dr. Eduard (Sean Mahon), who stitches Jozef's foot, and arranges for the agents to meet other members of the resistance, led by ""Uncle"" Jan Zelenka-Hajský (Toby Jones). The agents reveal that they are to execute ""Operation Anthropoid,"" the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich (Detlef Bothe), the main architect of the Final Solution, and the head of Nazi forces in German–occupied Czechoslovakia.
With limited intelligence and little equipment in a city under lock-down, Jozef and Jan must find a way to assassinate Heydrich, an operation that, they hope, will change the face of Europe. With the help of two young women, Marie Kovárníková (Charlotte Le Bon) and Lenka Fafková (Anna Geislerová) along with other plotters, the agents plan to ambush Heydrich as he arrives at his headquarters by car. When the agents learn that Heydrich is about to be transferred, the plan goes into effect with the duo bolstered by the addition of other agents who have been parachuted into Czechoslovakia and the remaining resistance fighters in Prague.
On 27 May 1942, the attack is carried out but nearly botched when Jozef's Sten submachine gun jams, but Heydrich is severely wounded when Jan throws a bomb that shatters his limousine, followed by Jozef's fusillade of gunfire. Immediately after, the assassins go on the run, and Nazi forces round up thousands of Czech citizens and carry out a terrible reprisal. When Heydrich dies, the combined group of seven parachutists are pursued to their refuge at the Orthodox Cathedral of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague. Resistance fighter Karel Čurda (Jiří Šimek) turns on the agents and reveals where they are hiding. The family who Jozef and Jan stay with are punished, their house attacked by numerous officers. The mother commits suicide by taking a cyanide tablet in the bathroom. The son is brutally tortured, which leads him to give in to the Nazis' demands. He tells them where Jozef and Jan are hiding, in the cathedral. Hundreds of Nazi troops storm the cathedral and all the agents are killed in a fierce battle.
Reprisals continue with the village of Lidice destroyed with all the males 15 years old and older shot, children gassed to death and women sent to camps. Another village, Ležáky, is also destroyed and its inhabitants are murdered because a radio transmitter is found there. Ultimately, a total of 5,000 Czechs and Slovaks were killed in the aftermath of the ""Heydrich Terror"". The assassination of SS-Obergruppenführer Heydrich was the only successful government-organised assassination of a top-ranking Nazi in the Second World War."
A Dark Song,"A bitter Sophia rents an isolated house in rural Wales, in order to help convince short tempered, occultist Joseph Solomon to lead her in a grueling, months-long rite in the old mansion, which will eventually summon her guardian angel. They will then both be allowed to ask the angel to grant them a special favor. A visibly grieving Sophia will ask her angel to be able to speak to her dead seven year old son. The serious and demanding Solomon explains to Sophia that once they begin, if they leave the house before the ritual is culminated they will be in grave peril. He says she must spend months of punishing exercises, in which they will be dealing with real demons and angels; she agrees. Over months she complies methodically with dozens of harrowing and painful exercises, but refuses to do the forgiveness ceremony. Grudgingly they get to know one another.
However, after months a frustrated Sophia complains that it’s taking too long, and Solomon accuses her of impairing the ritual by not being honest about something. She admits that the real favor she will ask the angel is revenge upon whoever kidnapped and killed her son. That night he awakens her to insist that because her dishonesty has made her unpure, a re-birthing ritual in the tub is required. However, he drowns her, says a spell, and revives her with CPR. Angry afterward in the kitchen, she pushes him and Solomon accidentally falls on a large kitchen knife, impaling him in the side. As she treats the wound with their meager medical supplies, he explains that this a sign that the ritual is beginning to work, and that she will have her revenge. He discloses that he will ask the angel to be invisible for the rest of his life, in order to be away from people “to gain some quiet before the howl.”
As Solomon soldiers on with the wound, insisting he is just fine, Sophia begins seeing and hearing dark and menacing presences in the house, including the pleading voice of her son. As Solomon's wound becomes increasingly infected, he begins to fail, and eventually dies in his sleep. When she goes back to his books for further instruction, everything has been crossed out, unreadable. Sophia steps beyond the perimeter of the house, but her car won't start. After walking a lengthy distance down an empty road, she is disturbed to realize that she has arrived back at the mansion.
She re-enters to discover various kinds of demons appearing and re-appearing. At one point, one smashes her over the head, and they drag her to the basement, tormenting her, and cut off a finger, as she tells them how sorry she is. However, they retreat as a brilliant white light fills the house. She finds a massive, beatific angel in armor awaiting her; Sophia asks it for the power to forgive, and it smiles. Later she performs a water burial of Solomon in a nearby pond, and drives away."
David Brent: Life on the Road,"Fifteen years after his appearance in the BBC2 ""documentary"" series The Office, David Brent is a sales rep for bathroom supply firm Lavichem. His colleagues include his nemesis, Jezza, who cannot stand Brent or his jokes; however, he gets a more sympathetic response from colleague Pauline and receptionist Karen, and shares the same sense of humour as fellow sales rep Nigel.
Desperate to resume his music career and sign a record deal, Brent takes a month of unpaid leave and uses money from his pension to pay his fellow band members (Foregone Conclusion), his rapper friend Dom, Dan the sound engineer (whom he boldly offers double what he earns at the studio), a PR consultant, and many other costs, to arrange a tour of venues around Berkshire.
As the tour wears on, the band and crew refuse to socialise with Brent (unless he pays them to do so), and even make him drive behind the tour bus claiming there is no room for him. When Brent finally manages to convince a record company rep to attend a show, they are more interested in Dom's rapping than Brent's music. As the costs of the tour spiral out of control, sound engineer Dan confronts a dejected Brent, telling him to stop wasting his money. The band plays one final show, and then willingly join Brent for a drink.
Brent returns to Lavichem to the delight of Pauline, Karen and Nigel. Pauline asks him to take her out for a coffee and she takes his hand as they head out."
Brotherhood,"Ten years after the events of Adulthood, Sam has now settled down. He has a partner, Kayla, and two kids, one from a previous relationship with Lexi who has died. He is on much better terms with his mother, Mrs. Peel, and brother Royston and has also befriended Alissa, who now has a teenage daughter from her relationship with the late Trevor 'Trife' Hector, whom Sam killed in Kidulthood. Now Sam has four jobs and also works out at a local gym. One day when he arrives, he overhears a girl describe to the owner how she was attacked by someone called 'Mooks.' The owner pulls out a gun, sees Sam listening in and closes the door.
Royston is in a band with Henry. One night, when they're playing a gig, a gunman, Drew, enters the venue and non-fatally shoots Royston on orders. Before he escapes in a Jeep, Drew leaves an envelope addressed to Sam next to Royston. Sam visits Alissa with some money for her daughter. Alissa, who has forgiven Sam, says they must soon tell Trife's daughter, who sees Sam as a family friend, what happened to Trife.
Sam visits Royston in the hospital and sees their mother there. She asks Sam to bring the grandchildren to see her soon. Afterwards, Sam learns from Henry that it wasn't an accident, as told earlier. Henry gives Sam the envelope. It contains an address with instructions for Sam to go there. Sam asks Henry to come with him, but Henry refuses.
On his way home, Sam bumps into a mystery lady, who ""accidentally"" spills coffee on him. She invites Sam to her flat to make amends and seduces him. They have sex, but unbeknownst to Sam, their interlude is being taped. Sam heads home, discovers he is being followed, and attacks the mystery man. While they grapple, the Jeep that facilitated gunman Drew's escape pulls up. Out comes Melvin (AKA 'Hugs'). When he hugs assailants, he knifes them for crossing him or his friends. Hugs pledges to cut Sam and also threatens his family. If Sam fails to go to the address in the envelope, more people will get hurt.
Sam arrives at the place, a lavish property in a well-to-do area. He sees the man that he originally assaulted and jumps him again. Sam gains access to the house but finds he is outnumbered. After an initial beating, a man named Daley intervenes. He is a successful criminal, who works for a notorious Kingpin known as 'Mooks'. He shows Sam around the house and it's clear he runs drugs and high-end prostitution. Daley offers Sam a job, but he refuses. Daley then directs Sam to a basement room in the house where he meets up with Curtis, Trife's uncle. The two have a long-standing feud because Sam killed Trife and also set up Curtis for a 10-year stretch. Curtis is now out and tells Sam he's after revenge - not just against Sam, but also his family, despite Sam telling Curtis that he wants no trouble and just intends to live his life. After an initial struggle Sam leaves the property. He is caught on the street by Drew and some of Daley's other young thugs. Drew tells Sam that he's the one who shot Royston. In the nick of time, Henry turns up to help Sam escape. Hugs stabs one of the kids who let Sam get away as a warning to those who fail him.
As Sam and Henry escape, Sam realizes his family is in danger. He phones Kayla to suggest she take the kids to her mother's for the night, as he has to prepare for a job interview. Back with Kayla Sam finds out that a DVD of his sexual encounter with the mystery lady was delivered to his home. Sam protests that he was set up, but Kayla walks out. Sam reaches out for help to his old volunteer PC friend Desmond 'Buds' Lynch, now a detective. Buds and a colleague go to the address where Sam was, but Daley belittles and threatens them for not having a warrant.
Curtis phones Sam, to further frighten him and his family. After the threatening call, Daley is furious that Sam has contacted the police and orders Curtis to speed things up by spilling the blood of Sam's family. Instead, Curtis and Hugs secretly conspire to kill Daley and take over the operation. Sam's mother is returning home when she sees a girl being attacked. The assailants promptly run away so Mrs. Peel helps the girl, Janette, into her flat. Janette claims she was robbed, but she still has her mobile phone and uses it to text someone. Meanwhile, Mrs. Peel calls Sam and tells him what's happening. Sam senses something amiss and asks Mum to describe the girl. After a brief description Mrs. Peel ends the call as the doorbell rings. Sam knows something is definitely wrong here and heads to the flat. Mrs. Peel asks Janette, the same girl who seduced Sam and works for Daley, not to open the door, but she lets in Curtis and Hugs. They threaten Mrs. Peel for what Sam has done, then Hugs pushes her off the balcony to her death. The police try to restrain a devastated Sam, but he attacks them and then is arrested. After Buds interrogates him, Sam is released without charge. He arranges and attends his mother's funeral and wake. Royston tells Sam that his fiancée is pregnant and they plan to move to America. After Sam and Kayla have sex following the funeral, she makes it clear that she and the kids are not coming home until Sam ends his involvement with Curtis and Daley.
Sam, vowing to kill Curtis and Daley, breaks into the gym planning to steal a gun he had spotted during his workout. The owner of the gym, named ""Brick"", catches and interrogates Sam, thinking he works for Mooks. Once Sam explains his intentions, Brick reveals that Mooks raped his little sister Sariya. Since then, he and his partner Calvin have been searching for Mooks to get revenge. They let Sam go and he again enlists Henry to help him. Henry has been lying to his partner to excuse time away from her and his son, who he wrongly thinks is not his. Henry tracks one of Daley's henchman to a café run by Sam's employer Hassan. With Hassan's help he learns where to find some of Daley's other henchmen. Meanwhile, Sam goes to a party and meets more of Daley's people, who direct him to a play-park. After taking some 'tools' from Henry's car, Sam goes to the play-park. Drew is there, getting a blowjob from a girl while two of his friends look on. Sam assaults Drew with a nail-gun until he tells Sam where Curtis and Daley are. Elsewhere, one of Drew's thugs, Yardz, threatens Henry with a hammer. Henry successfully persuades Yardz to change his life and walk away from involvement with Mooks.
Sam gathers some help, including Hassan, Henry, Brick, Sariya and Calvin, and goes to Daley's estate, where he finds both Hugs and Daley. Sam and his people storm the house, as armed police approach the scene. Heading upstairs, Sam finds a locked penthouse door and Janette outside. He knocks her out for everything she's done to help Daley and then kicks down the door. Meanwhile, Daley has known all along that Curtis and Hugs have been planning to double-cross him, so he stabs Hugs, killing him. When Sam gains entry to the penthouse, he finds Hugs' body and Daley gone. Sam pulls the knife from Hugs; just as the police arrive and find him there. The rest of Sam's crew have fled, but everyone left in the house - Sam, the prostitutes and rest of Daley's men - are all arrested.
Buds exerts his influence to exonerate Sam as the suspect for Hugs' murder, in return for his giving up Curtis, Daley and Mooks. Sam calls Curtis to arrange a meeting and settle this once and for all. They meet seemingly alone at an abandoned location to fight to the death. Sam overcomes Curtis and wrestles a gun from him. Instead of killing him as agreed, he empties the rounds from the clip, leaves the gun and bullets on the floor next to Curtis and walks away. Wounded, Curtis gets to his feet, picks up the gun, and loads a single bullet, but before he can shoot Sam, armed police gun him down and Sam goes back to confront Curtis. As he dies, Curtis manages to tell Sam where Daley is.
Sam tracks Daley to a flat where he's filled a bag with millions of pounds, ready to escape. To stop him from leaving, Sam switches on the light, revealing Brick, Sariya and Calvin. They unmask Daley as Mooks, the real boss, the one who had beaten and raped Sariya. Sam confronts Mooks for his actions, grabs the bag from him and leaves. Brick pulls out a pistol and silencer and shoots Mooks dead.
Safely away, Sam divides up the money with everyone who helped him get revenge on Curtis, Drew and Mooks. There's money for Royston and Alissa, too. Now strolling through a shopping mall with Kayla and the kids, Sam encounters Buds. The detective says Sam will get no more help from him but affirms they're still friends, warning him to stay out of trouble. As the family walks off, Sam tells Kayla, ""It's done."""
The Light Between Oceans,"Tom Sherbourne, a traumatised and withdrawn hero of World War I, is hired as a lightkeeper at Janus Rock, a lighthouse off the coast of Western Australia. He falls in love with a local girl, Isabel Graysmark, and they marry in 1921. Isabel loses two pregnancies in three years, and fears she may never become a mother.
Shortly after Isabel's second miscarriage, a rowboat containing a dead man and a newborn baby girl washes up on the shore near the lighthouse. Tom knows that regulations require him to report the discovery. However, Isabel fears that the baby will almost certainly be sent to an orphanage, and persuades Tom to pass the baby off as their own. Tom grudgingly agrees. He buries the man on the island and they name the girl Lucy.
As Tom and Isabel are about to have Lucy christened on the mainland, Tom sees a woman, Hannah Roennfeldt, kneeling in front of a grave, bearing the names of Frank Roennfeldt and his baby daughter Grace Ellen, who were lost at sea on the day they found Lucy, 26 April 1923. Tom fears that Lucy might very well be Hannah's missing daughter. He writes anonymously to her to tell her that her husband is dead but that her baby is safe and well cared-for.
Four years later, Tom, Isabel, and Lucy, who have enjoyed an idyllic life together, attend a ceremony for the anniversary of Tom's lighthouse, and they strike up a conversation with Hannah and her sister, Gwen Potts. They learn that Frank was a German, that Hannah's marrying him so soon after the First World war was controversial, and that he had been accosted in the street by a drunken crowd. He jumped into a rowboat and fled along with his baby daughter. Tormented by his conscience, Tom sends Hannah a small rattle that was found with Lucy on the boat. One of Tom's co-workers recognizes the rattle on a reward poster, and reports him to the police.
Tom takes full responsibility, claiming he bullied Isabel into complying. Isabel is enraged that Tom is willing to give Lucy away, and breaks off contact with him after his arrest. Lucy is returned to her birth family, but initially rejects and hates them, having no memory of them. She refuses to answer to ""Grace"", and even runs away in an effort to go back to the lighthouse.
The police accuse Tom of murdering Frank, and are unable to draw an answer from the distraught Isabel as to whether he was dead when they discovered him. Just as Tom is about to be taken by boat to Albany for trial, Isabel reads a letter which Tom had sent her, writing of how he had not deserved his happiness with her and how carrying the blame will assuage his guilt for surviving the war. She jumps on the boat and confesses everything. Moved by their gesture, Hannah offers to speak on their behalf at trial. Lucy has at last begun to bond with her biological mother and grandfather, who agrees to call her ""Lucy-Grace"" as a compromise.
In 1950, an adult Lucy-Grace Rutherford, accompanied by her baby son Christopher, tracks Tom down. She has not been in contact with the Sherbournes for over twenty years, as they had agreed not to contact her for the rest of her childhood. Isabel has recently died, still tormented with guilt for her actions, and Tom gives Lucy-Grace a letter that she wrote for her in case she ever made contact. An emotional Lucy-Grace thanks Tom, the only father she knew, for rescuing and raising her for the few years on Janus, and they promise to stay in touch."
The 9th Life of Louis Drax,"Louis Drax (Longworth), a 9-year-old boy, narrates that throughout his short life he has survived a series of near-fatal accidents, and the most recent one involves a suspicious fall off a cliff during a picnic with his parents, the cause of which he does not explain. Through a series of flashbacks, Louis's sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Perez (Platt) are shown. Perez asks Louis about his opinions and past, learning that Louis exhibits certain peculiar behaviors, such as a distrust of men and repeated killings of his pet hamsters, an act Louis justifies by calling it ""The Right of Disposal."" Perez is suspicious of Louis's relationship with his father, Peter (Paul). Additional flashbacks reveal a strained relationship between Peter and Louis's mother, Natalie (Gadon), including an incident where Peter and Louis run into Peter's ex-wife during a trip to SeaWorld, resulting in a fight between Peter and Natalie. Despite Dr. Perez promising that everything Louis told him would be confidential, he tells Natalie about his concerns, causing her to end the sessions as she believes Perez is interfering with her marriage.
In the present, a doctor examining Louis after his latest accident pronounces him dead. After Louis is transported to the morgue, however, he suddenly awakes, and is placed in intensive care in a coma. Meanwhile, Peter, who has disappeared, is immediately the primary suspect in the possible attempted murder of Louis. Louis's case attracts the attention of Dr. Allan Pascal (Dornan), who is fascinated by Louis's sudden turnaround and becomes the lead doctor in charge of Louis's care. Despite Allan being married, he and Natalie share a mutual attraction, and he kisses her one-day while the two go on a walk, which is seen by everyone. As soon as this happens, Louis briefly awakens from his coma, only to mutter 'my dad' before falling back unconscious.
Natalie and Allan receive threatening letters telling them to stay away from each other, with the author of said letters claiming to be Louis himself. Dalton (Parker), the lead investigator on Louis's case, believes the letters to be written by Peter. To help find the writer, everyone in the hospital submits to a handwriting test. For Natalie's protection, she is given a room in the hospital to stay in until Peter is found. Dalton warns Allan not to become involved with Natalie, telling him that not only is Peter not Louis's real father, but at one point Natalie attempted to give Louis up for adoption. Natalie confesses to Allan that Louis was the result of a rape from a different man, and despite Dalton's warnings, she and Allan have sex.
Louis is visited in the hospital by his grandmother, Peter's mother Violet (Hershey). Violet, who notices Allan and Natalie's relationship, warns Allan that Natalie is unstable and manipulative, implying she has lied about multiple things including her rape. Dalton suddenly enters, informing Violet and Allan that Peter's body has been found at the bottom of a cliff, having been dead for several days.
While all of the above is happening, Louis continues to narrate, seemingly aware of everything going on despite being in a coma. At certain points he is visited by a mysterious, deformed creature covered in seaweed, who gives him advice and encouragement. Allan also sees this creature at one point in a dream he has while sleeping by Louis's side. Louis visits the creature in a cave, and it is ultimately revealed that it is Louis's manifestation of Peter, who was found dead in a cave covered in seaweed. The Peter creature is very kind to and protective of Louis, and Louis doesn't want to leave him.
One day, while waking up from a nap, Allan is told by another doctor that not only did he sleepwalk during his nap, but he also wrote a prescription for Natalie, for dangerous doses of insulin and chloroform. This, combined with Allan's other dreams and the suspicious letters, leads Allan to believe that while he sleeps, Louis has somehow been controlling him and his actions. This is further supported when it is discovered that Allan's handwriting matches that of the threatening letters. Allan informs Dr. Perez, who decides to work with Allan to get to the bottom of the situation. He hooks Allan up to an EKG and through meditative exercises manages to directly communicate with Louis via Allan's mind and voice.
Louis reveals what happened during the picnic: Natalie tries to give Louis some candy but refuses to allow Peter to have any, making Peter suspicious about Natalie possibly harming Louis and leading to a fight. Louis flees to the cliff edge, while Natalie and Peter follow and get into a scuffle, which ends when Natalie pushes Peter off the cliff to his death. Louis sees this and despite Natalie's pleas, walks off the edge of the cliff on his own in an apparent suicide attempt.
At this point, Louis's heartbeat suddenly stops and Allan wakes up. While Allan tries to revive him with a defibrillator, it is shown that Natalie is responsible for Louis's 'accidents', having done things such as poison his candy, electrocute him while near a socket, and smother him with a pillow. Allan succeeds in restarting Louis's heart while Natalie looks on.
Some time later, Allan moves out after separating from his wife. He visits Natalie, who has been placed in a psychiatric ward under Dr. Perez's care. Perez explains to Allan that he has diagnosed Natalie with Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and her multiple abuses of Louis were her attempts to grow closer to him by 'saving' him from near-death situations, which she herself put him in. It is shown that Natalie is now pregnant, presumably with Allan's child.
In a final narration, Louis ponders the fact that his mother was 'the bad one' and whether being in a coma forever is bad, as it allows him to stay with his father. Peter's voice, however, tells Louis that the world is beautiful and he needs to grow up and live his life. Louis finally awakens from his coma, and the film ends."
Morgan,"Lee Weathers is a ""risk-management specialist"" for genetic-engineering company SynSect. She arrives at a rural site hosting its L-9 project, an artificial being with nanotechnology-infused synthetic DNA named Morgan. The ""hybrid biological organism with the capacity for autonomous decision making and sophisticated emotional responses"" is smarter than humans and matures quickly, walking and talking within a month and physically a teenager despite being five years old.
The cold and precise Weathers—she insists on calling Morgan ""it""—is at the site to assess the project after a psychologist evaluates Morgan, after she used a pen to stab Dr. Kathy Grieff in the eye. Over dinner with the team of eight scientists, Weathers (who speaks Chinese) and project leaders Dr. Lui Cheng and Dr. Simon Ziegler discuss an incident in Helsinki involving Cheng in which 21 SynSect researchers were killed in an hour by ""crude prototypes"".
Lee learns that Morgan attacked Grieff when she was prohibited from leaving her room, a glass cell, after killing a deer impaled on a fallen tree while outside. The scientists have raised Morgan from birth following two failed attempts, and most consider her to be their child; Grieff defends Morgan to Weathers despite her injury, and Dr. Amy Menser wants to resume taking her on outings. The latter promises Morgan to take her to a nearby lake that she describes as wonderful; the behavioral therapist understands that Morgan is, despite her intellect and physical appearance and abilities, emotionally childlike. Although Morgan considers Cheng to be her ""mother"", the scientist is pessimistic about the project; she ended the outings because, Cheng tells Weathers, it is cruel to expose Morgan to a world she cannot be allowed to enter.
Psychologist Dr. Alan Shapiro arrives; when the artificial intelligence expert aggressively taunts Morgan as part of his evaluation, she kills him. Weathers tranquilizes Morgan after a brief escape, and decides that she is too unpredictable and must be terminated. The scientists refuse to kill Morgan; before Weathers can do so, they inject her with sedative and imprison her in the cell in which Morgan had been held. The scientists plan to escape with Morgan, but after waking she kills most of them, while Ziegler commits suicide.
In the scientists' house, Cheng records an apology for the failure of the project. The scientists tried to make Morgan ""more human"" than the previous attempts so she could exceed her design as a combat weapon, but found that the result was harder to control. Morgan arrives and, after conversing with her ""mother"" in Chinese, suffocates her. Weathers escapes the cell and briefly fights Morgan, able to match her. Morgan flees with the terrified Menser, who Morgan says is the only scientist who was a real friend to her.
Weathers and nutritionist Skip Vronsky follow the pair. The latter deduces that Morgan has forced Menser to take her to the lake, which entrances Morgan. She and Weathers fight again, seemingly matched in strength and speed. Morgan knocks down Weathers, who is impaled on the branch of a fallen tree. Morgan flees again but Weathers catches up and kills her. She shoots Menser and Vronsky to eliminate witnesses.
Weathers's superior at SynSect and another executive discuss the incident. They decide that it proves that the company's earlier L-4 project—Lee Weathers—is superior as a ""perfect"", less-emotional, human hybrid weapon. Elsewhere, Weathers makes the same gesture with her hands as Morgan, when Shapiro had asked her how she had felt about injuring Grieff."
Una,"A young woman, Una (Mara), arrives unexpectedly at an older man's workplace looking for the truth behind the affair that occurred between them. The interactions were instigated by Ray (Mendelsohn) when she was a 13-year-old child and he was a next-door neighbor and trusted friend of her father.
The facts came to light on the eve of their planned elopement. Convinced by a misunderstanding that Ray had abandoned her, she wandered the streets distraught and bewildered, to be returned home by police, seemingly betrayed. He served four years in jail for his crime, treated as the lowest form of humanity by fellow-inmates. Then changing his name to ""Pete"", he rose to management level in a large warehouse. She grew up lonely and confused, living with her mother in the same house they lived in before the incident, and in her adulthood, now takes solace in going out for one-night stands and returning home before dawn.
She finds where he works through a newspaper photograph and confronts him just as he is due to address the workers regarding retrenchments. Unnerved, he leaves the meeting, and hides from his fellow staff members, but she finds him. They quarrel: he insists that he had been genuinely in love, was not by nature a paedophile, and had not been ""grooming"" her. They find they are still sexually attracted, but he has to prepare for a dinner party being held that night, and leaves her for his home. She leaves with employee Scott (Ahmed), a young single man, and invites herself to his place, where she seduces him. She then persuades Scott to escort her to Ray's luxury country residence, where the party is under way. Ray has no choice but to introduce Scott as a co-worker; Una ignores Ray, however he is clearly troubled by fears of being unmasked. The wife and Una talk briefly; she drops a hint that their marriage is not entirely happy. Una wanders upstairs, where she finds the bedroom of a teenage girl who is obviously loved; she enters and is laying on the bed when the girl enters and loudly demands an explanation. The daughter, Ray's wife's from an earlier marriage, is about 13 years old. Ray denies Una's unspoken accusation. He insists Una is the only one of that age he has ever desired, that she was ""the only one"" as he kisses her face, all while his wife, step-daughter and Scott look on from a distance. Una then walks off into the dark, and it is clear that Ray's cozy life is about to implode."
Bridget Jones's Baby,"On her 43rd birthday, Bridget Jones is awoken by her mother who reminds her that her time to have children is running out. She goes to attend the funeral of Daniel Cleaver, who is presumed dead after a plane crash. While there, she sees her ex, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) and his new wife. They bump into one another somewhat awkwardly and then go their separate ways.
Bridget now works as a television producer and is close friends with the anchor of the show she runs, Miranda (Sarah Solemani), who offers to take her out for her birthday. Bridget turns down her offer to spend time with her old group of friends, but is heartbroken when they cancel on her due to commitments to their children.
Deciding to celebrate her single life Bridget accepts Miranda's offer to take her away for the weekend. They go to a music festival where Miranda challenges her to sleep with the first man she meets. Falling in the mud, Bridget is helped out by a random stranger. After attending an Ed Sheeran concert, a drunk Bridget crawls into a yurt she thinks belongs to her and Miranda but actually belongs to the handsome stranger she met earlier. The two have sex and in the morning Bridget makes her escape. The stranger returns disappointed that she is gone.
Returning home, Bridget goes to the christening of Jude's youngest child where she is the godmother and Mark has been asked to be the godfather. Mark tells her that he and his wife are planning on divorcing and Bridget has sex with him. When Mark reveals he is travelling the next day, Bridget is reminded that he had always put work before their relationship and leaves in the morning before he wakes up, leaving behind a note telling him that reconnecting with him is too painful.
Bridget finds that she is gaining weight. Shazzer suggests that Bridget might be pregnant, especially when she realises that Bridget used old, expired condoms when having sex. Taking a pregnancy test at work, Bridget confirms she is pregnant and decides that she wants to keep the baby as it is her last chance to have a child.
After a visit to the obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr. Rawlings, she realizes that she does not know who the father is and doesn't even have a way of contacting Jack, the handsome stranger. However, Miranda spies him on TV where they realize that Jack Qwant is a billionaire and the inventor of a dating site that has an algorithm to match couples together. Miranda conspires with Bridget to have Jack on the show to take hair samples so that Bridget will be able to test it against the DNA of her baby to either confirm or eliminate Jack as the father. At the taping the hair and makeup artist is able to nab samples of Jack's hair for Bridget but Jack recognizes Bridget, and she decides to tell him that she is pregnant and that he is the father, without mentioning Mark. Initially taken aback Jack decides to throw himself into the role of supporting Bridget.
Feeling things are going too quickly with Jack, Bridget decides to go forward and tell Mark. However Mark is so thrilled at the news that he is about to be a father that Bridget does not tell him about Jack. Bridget also decides not to go forward with testing the DNA while her child is still in the womb as she is terrified by the possibility that she might miscarry. She persuades Dr. Rawlings to go through appointments twice, once with Jack and another time with Mark.
Bridget invites Jack to a work event and is startled when Mark shows up as well. The two men immediately take a liking to one another, finding the other's accomplishments impressive. They go out to dinner where Bridget finally comes clean and tells them that she is unsure who the father is. Jack takes the news well, telling Bridget that the child is the priority. Mark Darcy is upset and walks out of the restaurant.
At an ante-natal class, Jack arrives early and Bridget is gratified when Mark shows up as well. Jack and Mark are mistaken for a gay couple with Bridget as their surrogate, much to Mark's discomfort and Jack's amusement. Mark is also jealous at the easy rapport that Jack has with Bridget and his warmth in taking care of her.
Bridget experiences cramps and goes to the hospital, taking Jack with her as she is unable to reach Mark. When at last Mark arrives he is upset to see the two laughing together and embracing. Mark and Jack fight and Bridget sends them out of the room. Outside, Jack implies that he and Bridget had sex without condoms, making Mark realize that he is less likely to be the father. He leaves once again and ignores Bridget's calls.
Bridget continues to prepare for the arrival of her baby, now with only Jack by her side. They have a discussion where he asks her to move in with him and confesses that life for him is lonely. Bridget asks him what will happen if Mark is the father and he tells her he will need to re-evaluate their relationship if that is the case. He also confesses that the reason Mark has been absent is because Jack heavily implied that Mark was unlikely to be the father. An upset Bridget goes to talk to Mark, but sees his wife arriving at his house and decides to let him be.
At nine months, Bridget quits her job rather than being fired for numerous gaffes and unprofessional mishaps, notably inviting a guest onto the show with the sole intent of obtaining a sample of his DNA, live broadcasting bare arses during the launch event of a public news-gathering initiative and mixing up a guest with his chauffeur. Unemployed, exhausted, and hungry, she goes out shopping but has her card eaten by a cashpoint and locks herself out of the bank lobby, leaving her keys and her food inside. When no one buzzes her up to her building, she stands outside her apartment in the rain feeling miserable. Mark arrives and breaks in for her. He informs her that he and his wife are going through with their divorce and she was only there to pick up the last of her things. Just as they are about to kiss, Bridget's water breaks. When his phone rings for work, he throws it out the window in a romantic gesture, which leaves them without a means to call transport to the hospital. They enlist the help of a local restaurant to get them to hospital, but a traffic jam due to protests forces them to walk. Overtaken by contractions, Bridget cannot walk and Mark offers to carry her, but almost collapses. Jack arrives just in time and the two of them get Bridget to the hospital.
During labour, both Mark and Jack try to help Bridget. However, during labour Bridget accidentally punches Jack in the nose. She also reaches to Mark for comfort and he reassures her that she can get through labour and he will love her no matter whether the child is his or not, while sustaining an agonizing bite to the wrist by Bridget. While Jack and Mark wait outside, Jack apologizes to Mark for his behaviour and Mark accepts. Bridget gives birth to a boy and all of Bridget's friends and relatives come to visit her in the delivery room. Meanwhile, Dr. Rawlings has both men come with her to perform the DNA test. After having bonded for the last 6 months Mark and Jack each wish each other luck.
A year later Bridget prepares to be married. At the altar she is greeted by Jack, holding her son, and then moves forward to marry Mark. After the wedding, Mark and Jack, now friends, head to the reception together while Bridget carries her and Mark's son, William.
A newspaper lying on a bench reveals that Daniel Cleaver has been found alive in the woods in the wreckage of the plane."
The Journey,"It is October 2006, and the Northern Ireland peace process is debating a new agreement in St Andrews, Scotland. Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness meet for the first time and the negotiations begin. Paisley, however, needs to return home to his wife in Northern Ireland for his 50th wedding anniversary. Bad weather closes the nearby airport, so it is suggested that Paisley be driven to another airport where a private jet will take him home. McGuinness allows the change in plans, but only if he travels in the car and plane with Paisley.
The two enemies are then driven in a van for a number of hours. Unbeknownst to either of them, MI5 is listening in with a spy camera and microphone, and can communicate with the young driver, who is given leeway to speak to his passengers and encourage discussion.
Paisley and McGuinness remain implacable to one another in defense of their past actions. Paisley sees McGuinness as a terrorist and murderer, while McGuinness sees Paisley as a man who used his influence and power to encourage violence. McGuinness, seeing his past actions as part of a broader civil war that might soon be over, continues to speak to Paisley in the hope that they can seal a permanent peace agreement.
Meanwhile, back in St. Andrews, Tony Blair and MI5 agents watch the conversation with interest.
The driver is then instructed by MI5 to take a diversion into a forest. This, along with the departure of a security detail following the van, begins to raise suspicions in McGuinness. Suddenly the van driver hits the brakes and the vehicle slides into a stack of timber next to the road, piercing a tire. The driver claims to have hit a deer, but McGuinness and Paisley see no blood on the front of the car. While McGuinness and Paisley wander in the woods and continue to talk, the driver urgently speaks to MI5 and reveals that he does not know how to change a flat tire.
In the woods, the two enemies continue to argue their points and defend their actions to one another. McGuinness also begins to wonder if their current situation had been planned, with the possibility that one or both of them might be assassinated in a forest in the middle of nowhere. The discovery of the fatally wounded deer confirms to them both that their situation was not planned. When encouraged to kill the dying animal by Paisley, McGuinness picks up a heavy rock but eventually refuses to do the deed, surprising Paisley.
As the driver changes the tire, the two then find their way to a disused Protestant church, where Paisley identifies various martyrs in the stained glass windows as being from Foxe's Book of Martyrs. They wander outside in a cemetery, and the topic of the Enniskillen bombing is brought up. Paisley rages at the IRA and McGuinness for the bombing, which killed innocent bystanders and not the soldiers that were being targeted. McGuinness admits that the bombing was wrong and that it caused the IRA to question its actions. He also reveals to Paisley the conversation he had with his young daughter about the bombing, and how it made him feel. Paisley viciously responds to McGuinness' honesty by claiming that he was crying crocodile tears.
The heated argument convinces McGuinness that there is no point continuing, and he refuses to re-enter the van. Paisley then states that his own ""bark"" is worse than his ""bite"", which indicates to McGuinness that while Paisley may not be apologetic, he is at least conciliatory. The van drives off with both men inside.
As the van gets nearer to the airport the driver realises they need fuel. They pull over at a service station but the driver's credit card no longer works since it was bent during the changing of the tire. The driver asks McGuinness and Paisley if they have a credit card, but they do not, Paisley stating that charging interest is usury and is apparently against the Bible. At an impasse and needing to hurry, Paisley enters the service station and uses his fame and his public speaking voice to convince the clerk to try the driver's card again. This time the card works.
McGuinness and Paisley then walk back to the van, where McGuinness notices a hidden pistol in the driver's belt and confronts him. The driver then admits that he is with MI5 and that he was in touch with them the whole time - but that their agenda is peaceful and directed at getting the two to talk. McGuinness tries to tell Paisley this, but Paisley has collapsed inside the van with angina. McGuinness helps Paisley to retrieve his medication and settles him down.
Reflecting upon the stained glass windows he saw in the church, Paisley then orders the van off the road and exits, speaking to McGuinness alone. He then speaks about how he saw himself as being a potential martyr for his cause but here he was at age 81 having suffered no violence upon himself at all. McGuinness encourages this line of thought, and tells him that if peace should come, Paisley's people will hate Paisley, and McGuinness' people would hate McGuinness, and that would be a courageous act.
The van enters a secure part of the airport and stops in a hanger with a private jet and a heavily armed security detail. Paisley then asks for time alone with McGuinness, so the driver leaves. Paisley then issues an ultimatum to McGuinness: he will support the peace process and sign the accords if McGuinness offers a heartfelt apology to him for all the actions of the IRA. McGuinness refuses, saying that he plays ""the long game"" and that any apology he might offer Paisley privately would go against everything he stands for, thus he apologises for nothing. At this, Paisley smiles and praises McGuinness for being a real politician and never apologising. Paisley then says that he despises everything that McGuinness has done, and McGuinness says that he despises everything Paisley stands for. But the two shake hands as friends, and the peace process is sealed. The film ends with actual pictures of Paisley and McGuinness working and smiling together as first and deputy ministers of Northern Ireland."
Free Fire,"Stevo and Bernie are driving to meet two IRA members, Chris and Frank. On the way, Stevo tells Bernie that he was beaten up the previous day by the cousin of a woman he abused. The group meet outside a Boston warehouse, where they wait with intermediary Justine. A representative arrives, Ord, who leads them inside. The group is there to buy guns from arms dealer Vernon and his associates, Martin, Harry and Gordon. Despite tensions between the two groups and the fact that Vernon supplied the wrong weapons, Chris' group secure the weapons in a van and hand over the money in a briefcase.
Stevo notices that Harry was the one who beat him up the day before, and refuses to go near him, irritating Frank. Harry eventually notices and lashes out at Stevo, furthering the tensions between the group. Stevo seemingly apologises, but then brags about what he did to Harry's cousin. Infuriated, Harry shoots Stevo in the shoulder. Both groups split off and begin shooting at each other. Martin, who was holding the briefcase, is grazed by a bullet in the head. The briefcase now lies in the open, with Vernon attempting to coerce one of his men to get it.
Bernie is shot in the back by Harry and dies shortly after. Soon, two men with rifles begin shooting at both groups. One of them, Jimmy, is killed, the other is recognised by Ord as Howie, who reveals that he was hired to kill everyone and take the money. Before Howie can reveal who hired him, he is shot by Chris's group. Chris, defending Justine, requests that Vernon's group let her go. Gordon crawls after her, intent on killing her.
As the shooting continues, a telephone rings in one of the offices. Realising that they can call for backup, Chris sends the wounded Frank to the office, which prompts a wounded Vernon to go after him. Gordon chases Justine to the warehouse entrance, but she manages to kill him. As Chris, Ord, Stevo and Harry engage in another shootout, Vernon kills Frank after he is severely burned in a trap.
Martin regains consciousness, and begins shooting at his own group. He reveals that Howie and Jimmy were working for him. He gets the briefcase, but dies from his injuries. After getting past Ord and Harry, Chris gets to the office and kills Vernon. Using the phone to call his associates, Chris is cut off by Ord while Harry distracts Stevo. Returning to the warehouse, Justine takes Jimmy's rifle.
One of Chris's associates, Leary, enters the warehouse in search of his IRA comrades, but is killed by Harry. Taking the briefcase, Harry attempts to escape in the van, but Stevo fires at him. Harry runs over Stevo, but not before Stevo shoots him. The fire that Frank caused spreads and the sprinklers come on. Exhausted and out of bullets, Ord and Chris agree to stop fighting, take the money, and attempt to escape before the inevitable arrival of the police.
Justine shoots Ord in the head, accidentally shooting Chris as he was ""in the way"". Chris talks with Justine, regretting having not known her better as he begins to succumb to his wounds. As Justine walks to the warehouse entrance, red police lights are seen outside the warehouse, and she turns in shock as the sound of sirens becomes louder."
Message from the King,"Jacob King, living in South Africa, receives a message from his estranged sister Bianca, who lives in Los Angeles with her husband and step-son, that she is in trouble and has something ""they"" want. King flies to Los Angeles with a return ticket in seven days' time, intent on finding his sister and a booking at a cheap motel. Arriving, he meets a neighbor who held some of Bianca's belongings, given to her shortly before Bianca disappeared. The neighbor also informs King that his sister's husband disappeared, and the husband left Bianca with his son. He finds her landlady, who says that a local business owner suddenly paid Bianca's rent before she left, and that she had descended from sobriety to drug use and prostitution. King finds the business owner, Duke, with a group of men—part of a gang—and they deny any knowledge of her. A local shopkeeper tips King off that his sister is dead, and he finds her in the morgue, tortured and murdered.
Among Bianca's belongings, King finds several photographs of herself with various men, including a gang member who had denied knowing her, a dentist's-office card, and a pack of cigarettes. He confronts the gang member and mutilates his face, telling the man that this is ""a message from the King"", and steals his phone. At a party held by Bianca's neighbor, he finds out from the neighbor that the husband was pimping Bianca out to pay debts. He lures Bianca's dealer to the party and beats him for information, then steals his phone. Meanwhile, King accidentally interrupts a prostitute at the motel. The prostitute, glad he did not call the police, allows King to borrow her car for some money.
King goes to the dentist under the guise of a referral from his sister; he meets the connected Dr. Wentworth, who says that she was being pimped for her husband's debts and that she often disappeared. After the meeting, it is revealed that she was involved with a politician running for office, Frank Leary, who gives Wentworth the contact details for two hitmen to make the problem disappear. King follows Wentworth to the home of a wealthy Hollywood producer, Mike Preston, whom Wentworth shakes down for $100,000 to cover the cost of the hitmen, and another $750,000 of blackmail money due to his involvement with Bianca's death. At the house, King notices his sister's son, Armand, living at the mansion. Wentworth notices King's car when leaving Preston's house, and calls the hitmen.
Later that day, the hitmen, two LAPD officers, arrest King. King, realizing he is going to be killed, manages to escape, taking a beating in the process. His motel neighbor, Kelly, who is the prostitute who had lent King her car, finds him near the motel and nurses him back to health in her room. The gang realizes that Kelly's car was not stolen. King recovers from his beating and creates a bomb out of materials from a hardware store, then finds an encrypted SD card in Bianca's belongings, hidden in a pack of cigarettes. Realizing that this is what her killers wanted, he is only able to listen to snippets of audio but understands that Preston is the target. He sneaks into Preston's home and forces him to decrypt the file, which reveals camera footage of Preston committing acts of pedophilia on Armand during a party.
Preston reveals that Bianca's husband had fallen into serious debts and the debtors pimped Bianca out, forcing her on drugs, to pay them back. They killed her husband but continued to pimp her out, so she sold her son to Preston for money. When she realized that he was raping her son, she stole the footage and called King for help. Preston asked Wentworth to fix the issue, and Wentworth killed Bianca using the gang members. King lures both Duke and his gang members and Wentworth to Preston's mansion. He kills Preston, then plants a bomb in a packet of money. Duke and Wentworth open the packet, and both are killed. King takes Armand back to Kelly's motel, intent on rescuing the boy, but the sole surviving member of the gang—the one maimed a few days earlier—ambushes him in the room. The boy escapes before King is able to win; King gives chase to Armand, but ultimately gives up.
King drops Kelly and her daughter on the bus to her home town in New Mexico. He hands her a bag which has money he took from Preston's mansion earlier. As he is walking Leary's posters can be seen on the walls of the city of Los Angeles. King returns to South Africa where he is welcomed back and is revealed to be a detective of the local police force."
A United Kingdom,"The film is based on the true story of the heir to the throne of Bechuanaland, Seretse Khama of the Bamangwato people, who studies law in London immediately after World War II. There he meets a white woman, Ruth Williams, whom he eventually marries, despite the protests of both their families and opposition from the British government, which is concerned about relations with South Africa and the stability of the entire region of southern Africa. The National Party government in South Africa fears that the marriage of a black king to a white woman in neighboring Bechuanaland will inspire unrest, and pressures the British government to end the marriage.
Khama's uncle, the Regent, demands that he end his marriage to Ruth, and marry a Bamangwato princess, a demand that Khama rejects. The British administrators use the dispute between the King and the Regent to argue that the marriage of Seretse and Ruth is ""causing"" unrest in Bechuanaland. Seretse discovers that the British have allowed a US mining corporation to prospect for precious stones, and is eager to make sure that, if anything is found, the exploitation of the country's resources should solely be done by the people of Bechuanaland.
Seretse wants his people to support him as king and manages to win their backing, while the British government decides to exile him from his own country. Meanwhile, Ruth has their baby in Bechuanaland and becomes accepted by the local people by ""walking the road with them"". When the British want to proclaim an administrator to the Bechuana people instead of their king, the tribe refuses to convene a meeting to do so. The prime minister, Clement Attlee, tells the backbencher Tony Benn, that Britain needs gold from South Africa and he is willing to pay any price such as attempting to destroy the Khamas' marriage to stay in the good graces of South Africa. During this time, diamonds are found and Seretse makes sure that the British government publicly declares that the Bechuana people have the sole right to exploit these resources.
Churchill promises, if he were elected in the 1951 general election, to lift the exile on Seretse; however after his victory he turns the five-year ban into a lifelong one. In London, powerful people start supporting his claim, and he also receives support from the US government. Meanwhile, apartheid develops in South Africa and begins to overshadow Bechuanaland as well. Eventually, with the help of pressure from local people, he is allowed to return to Bechuanaland and negotiates its independence from the British. Seretse shows his uncle a leaked British government document showing he is qualified to be king, and that only opposition from South Africa is motivating the actions of the British government. Post-ending text reveals that Seretse oversees the creation of present-day Botswana, and that his son subsequently becomes the country's fourth elected president in 2008. It is revealed that Ruth and Seretse are buried side by side on a hilltop overlooking Serowe village, where they had lived for the remainder of their lives."
The Girl with All the Gifts,"In the near future, humanity has been ravaged by a mysterious fungal disease (a mutation of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis). The afflicted are robbed of all free will and turned into fast, mindless flesh-eaters, referred to as 'hungries'. Humankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid, second generation children who crave living flesh but retain the ability to think and learn. The children are imprisoned, and go to ""school"" at an army base in the Home Counties, where they are experimented on by Dr. Caroline Caldwell. Helen Justineau is responsible for educating and studying the children. Among the children is an exceptional girl named Melanie.
The base is overrun and the lab is breached. Melanie escapes the lab but outside the hungries are everywhere and soldiers are being swarmed and violently attacked in a failing, chaotic mass breach. Melanie wanders stunned by what she sees, but then violently attacks and infects two soldiers who are trying to restrain Helen. Helen and Melanie jump aboard an escaping armoured van.
The soldiers want to shoot Melanie, but Helen shields her and Caldwell insists she needs her. Melanie is muzzled and handcuffed to the gunner's chair atop the armoured vehicle and the group escapes into the wilderness. The van breaks down, the group proceed to London on foot. Caldwell reveals to Melanie that ""second generation"" hungries were discovered after newborns killed their infected mothers by burrowing out of the womb. When they try to leave the next day, they realize the hospital has been surrounded by a greater horde of hungries, and Melanie offers to lead the hungries away. She captures a small dog to use as bait to distract and lure the hungries away from the hospital so the group can escape.
As they progress through London they come across a mass of decomposing, infected bodies encircling the completely overgrown BT Tower and sprouting seed pods. Caldwell explains to the group that the pods contain spores that if released could end humankind. She reasons that she can save Helen and the human race for Melanie by making a vaccine. Melanie asks why her kind should die to save humanity if Caldwell admits that the children are in fact alive and not just imitators. Melanie runs back to the centre of London where she sets the towering seed-pod structure alight, causing it to germinate en masse and release an immense cloud of airborne spores. Not to soon after, Sgt. Parks finds Melanie by the BT Tower, fully ablaze and already seemingly infected by the spores. He cries out that this is the end of the world, whereas Melanie simply states its just ""not yours anymore"". He asks her to put him out his misery as he does not want to end up a hungry. He hands her his sidearm, and she tearfully obliges as he is about to turn. Melanie then returns to the lab to find Helen, standing just inside the hermetically sealed door, fearfully watching the spores fall around the lab.
The film closes with a tearful Helen awakening, secure from infection in the airlock, but effectively a prisoner inside the mobile med lab. Outside, sitting on the ground are the second generation children of the school/prison at the army base, along with the feral children all waiting and collected together, kept sternly in place by Melanie. Helen begins speaking through a microphone on outside speakers, once again to educate and teach all the children. It closes with Melanie asking for her favorite, a story, to which Helen politely declines and says not until bedtime. Melanie then responds that there'll be lots of time."
Trespass Against Us,"To give a better future to his son, Chad Cutler (Michael Fassbender) tries to get out of the criminal business that his family has run for generations. However, his own father Colby (Brendan Gleeson) considers doing so a betrayal, so it will not be easy for Chad to leave a well-rooted criminal system."
A Monster Calls,"Twelve-year-old Connor O'Malley must face his mother's terminal cancer, his strict grandmother, his estranged father, and his school bully, Harry. One night at 12:07 a.m., Connor is visited by the tree-like Monster, who tells Connor it has come to tell him three true stories, after which Connor must tell the Monster his own story: the truth behind his nightmare, which Connor refuses to do.
An old king who has lost his entire family (his sons were killed in fierce battles and his wife committing suicide because of this) save a young grandson, remarries a beautiful young woman. He dies before the prince comes of age, and many believe the queen poisoned the king. Not wanting to hand the kingdom over to the prince in a year, she plots to marry the prince and remain queen. The prince runs away with a farm girl he loves. They stop and sleep under a yew tree (the Monster), but in the morning he finds the young woman murdered. The prince tells the villagers that the queen, a witch, must have done it, and they rally to overthrow her. Before the commoners can reach the queen, the Monster carries her away to a far-off land where she lives out the rest of her life in peace. Though she was indeed a witch, she did not kill the farm girl or the king, who actually died of old age. The prince had murdered the farm girl himself in order to inspire his people to back him into overthrowing the queen. After the queen was taken to safety by the Monster, the prince continued to rule the kingdom in the grandfather's place.
An apothecary follows old traditions and beliefs, using herbs and brews to cure ailments. His business becomes less popular as a local parson tells his congregation not to accept the apothecary's old ways and denying the apothecary use of an old Yew tree. When the parson's two daughters become sick, the parson asks the apothecary to save their lives after all other resources are exhausted. When the apothecary asks why he should help a man who has turned people away from his skills and denied him the yew tree, his best source of healing ingredients, the parson promises to give him the tree and deliver the parishioners to him as customers. Yet the apothecary says that he cannot help, and the girls die. The Monster awakens from the yew tree to destroy the parson's house and raze it to the ground as punishment.
While the apothecary was a greedy man, he was a healer and would have saved lives, including the girls', if the parson had allowed him his way of life. The parson was a man of belief but was willing to discard his beliefs when they were in the way. The healing traditions followed by the apothecary require belief in order to work; without the parson's, the apothecary was unable to treat the two girls. Belief is half the cure.
A man was invisible because no one ever saw him. Tired of this, he summoned the Monster to ensure people would notice him. Though people now notice him, the man finds himself more alone than before.
Connor must confront his nightmare to tell the fourth story. His mother has been pulled to the edge of a cliff by a sudden collapse of the ground, and Connor must hold her hand to save her from falling. Eventually, his grip fails and his mother falls. The Monster forces Connor to confess the truth: Connor loosened his grip on purpose. While he could have held on longer, he let go in order to stop the pain of having to hold on.
Through the Monster, Connor ultimately understands that although he does not want his mother to die, it is something he must accept, and he must not feel guilty for wanting it to be over so he does not have to feel pain anymore. After this, Connor returns, with the Monster by his side, to comfort his mother one last time, and she dies at 12:07. He returns home with his grandmother, with whom he has reached an understanding, and she gives Connor the room that used to be his mother's. In the room, he finds his mother's old art book, which depicts the stories that were told to him by the Monster, and a drawing of his mother as a child with the Monster."
Lady Macbeth,"It's 1865. In rural England, a young woman named Katherine is in a loveless marriage to an older man, Alexander. They live at the country estate of Alexander's father, Boris. Katherine is forced to maintain a strict schedule and prevented from leaving the house. Boris scolds her for not giving Alexander a son, but Alexander's sexual interest in his wife seems to be limited to watching her naked body. One day, both Boris and Alexander have to leave the estate for separate business matters, leaving Katherine alone with the housemaid named Anna. For the first time in memory, she is free to explore the area to alleviate her boredom.
Katherine soon discovers Anna being suspended from the ceiling of an outhouse by the men who work on the land. She is attracted to one of them, Sebastian, and the next day sets herself up to meet him. When Sebastian comes to the house to visit Katherine, they begin an affair. Anna informs the local priest, who attempts to warn Katherine, but she sends him away. When Boris returns home, he is informed of the affair, beats Sebastian and locks him in a stable, and threatens Katherine when she demands his release. Katherine poisons his food, and calmly makes small talk with Anna as he chokes to death in the next room.
Anna is terrified into muteness, and Boris is buried without suspicion. Katherine takes over the estate, and she and Sebastian continue their affair openly. One night, while they are asleep in Katherine's marital bed, she awakes to realise that Alexander has returned home. After he reveals that he is aware of the infidelity, Katherine summons Sebastian and they start to have sex in front of him. A fight ensues, during which Katherine kills Alexander. The couple bury Alexander's body in the woods and kill his horse. They are not directly accused of the murder, and Sebastian begins to dress and behave as the lord of the manor himself.
A woman arrives at the estate with a young boy named Teddy, who she claims is the product of an affair between Alexander and her daughter. Katherine reluctantly shelters the pair. Sebastian, angry at the change in living arrangements, returns to the outhouse. Katherine realises she is pregnant, but is unable to inform Sebastian. She also begins to bond with Teddy. When Teddy disappears after Katherine scolds him, Sebastian finds the boy sitting over a waterfall and rescues him. When he returns Teddy to the house, he admits that he considered pushing him. Katherine dissuades Sebastian from leaving, promising to do anything he wants in return.
While Teddy's grandmother is asleep, the couple use the opportunity to smother Teddy. Sebastian hides in the woods while Katherine claims that Teddy died in his sleep. The village doctor is skeptical of the story, but while the issue is being discussed, a guilt-ridden Sebastian returns from the woods and confesses everything. Katherine calmly turns Sebastian's confession back on him, and accuses him of committing all the murders with Anna. Her word is taken over his, especially when Anna remains mute. As Sebastian and Anna are taken away by the police, Katherine remains alone in the house with her unborn child."
The Levelling,"Clover, now nearly finished her veterinary training, arrives back to the family farm on the Somerset Levels after her brother Harry commits suicide with a legally held shotgun at a party to celebrate the passing of title to the farm to him. Clover's father, Aubrey, is distracted, distant and uncommunicative. The farm and its buildings are dilapidated, as a result of the recent flooding of the levels. Aubrey is unable to accept Harry's death was suicide and protests that it must have been an accident.
Clover helps her father with the farm work, including milking their herd. While digging trenches with James, the farm labourer, they expose buried badger corpses. Clover is outraged and suspects Aubrey of being responsible. He tells her that it was Harry's doing, which disturbs Clover as she doesn't believe Harry could do such a thing. Aubrey explains that the farm is failing, insurance won't pay out for flood damage and that he is selling half the herd.
One of the pregnant cows gives birth to a male calf and Aubrey tells the vegetarian Clover to cull it immediately, before the heifer gets attached to it. She finds it extremely difficult to do but kills the calf nonetheless.
Clover cleans the house and the mobile home, where she and father currently reside, and finds cans of petrol in the kitchen. Later on at night, Clover invites James over to talk and leads him into the kitchen while carrying a flaming torch but he stops her saying it's too dangerous with the petrol. They leave the room and James explains what happened at the party. Clover learns that Aubrey and Harry fought at the party after Harry got heavily intoxicated and attacked James. She comes to believe that her brother was under a lot of pressure from their father to take over the farm.
The next day Animal Health turns up with transport for the reactors in the herd. A stunned Clover then learns that TB was present in the cows, she then informs her father who also did not know about the TB. Later on Clover confronts Aubrey about what happened to Harry but he blames her for staying at the university when he needed her there. They argue until the enraged Aubrey orders her from the mobile home.
The morning of the funeral arrives and Aubrey has been drinking again, and he confirms, unbidden by Clover, that Harry asked him to call her and ask her to come back to help. But he told Harry to knuckle down and sort it out himself. Just as she is about to leave for the funeral Clover notices that the key to the gun cupboard is missing and fears that Aubrey is going to kill himself. She hears a gun shot across the farm and dashes out onto the muddy fields where she finds a distraught Aubrey methodically shooting his own herd. He tells Clover that she should return to university as there is nothing for her at the farm. Clover replies that he is and the two finally embrace with Aubrey collapsing in sobs to the ground."
The Limehouse Golem,"A series of murders has shaken the community of Limehouse in Victorian London to the point where people believe that only a legendary creature from dark times – the mythical so-called Golem – must be responsible. When music-hall star Elizabeth Cree is accused of poisoning her husband John on the same night as the last Golem murders, assigned Inspector John Kildare discovers evidence linking John Cree to the Golem murders, and finds himself determined to crack both cases before Elizabeth is hanged for her accused crime.
Having found a diary of the Golem's crimes, written by the Golem himself in a book on the art of murder, kept in the reading room of the library, Kildare determines that the Golem must be one of the four men in the library on the date of the last entry; Dan Leno, Karl Marx, George Gissing and John Cree. Kildare is able to acquire handwriting samples of the other three men while listening to Elizabeth's story about how she went from the daughter of an unmarried mother sewing sail-cloths at the docks to becoming a music-hall star.
He finally finds a handwritten copy of a play written by Cree before his death on the day that Elizabeth is to be hanged, but when he gets an hour's postponement to her sentence, in the final talk with Elizabeth, Kildare realizes that she is the true Golem rather than her husband, seeking to make a lasting name for herself. Broken at this revelation, Kildare delays announcing the revelation that Cree was the Golem to the press until after Elizabeth is hanged, granting her the 'fame' of eliminating the Golem rather than the greater fame of being a killer."
Lion,"In 1986, Saroo, a five-year-old boy, lives with his elder brother Guddu, his mother and his younger sister in Khandwa, India. Guddu and Saroo steal coal from freight trains to trade for milk and food. One day, Saroo follows his brother to a job and they arrive at a nearby train station, where Saroo decides to stay back and take a nap. Guddu tries to wake him up, but Saroo is too tired. When Guddu does not return, Saroo searches for him and boards a train presuming Guddu is aboard. He falls asleep again in one of the compartments, and wakes up to find the train in motion. After several days, it arrives in faraway Calcutta, where he does not understand the local Bengali language. He stands at a ticket counter and tries to obtain a ticket home, but the attendant does not recognise the name of his village, which Saroo says is ""Ginestalay"".[4] He spends the night in the station with some streetchildren, but is then woken up and forced to run when a group of men try to kidnap them.
Saroo continues to wander around the city before coming across Noor, a seemingly friendly woman who brings him back to her apartment. She tells Saroo that a man named Rama will help him find his way home. Saroo runs away, sensing that Noor and Rama have sinister intentions, and escapes Noor when she chases after him. After two months of living near the Howrah Bridge, Saroo is taken to the police by a young man. Unable to trace his family, they put him in an orphanage. Three months later, Saroo is introduced to Mrs. Sood, who tells him she has placed an advertisement about him in several local newspapers, but no one has responded. She then tells him that an Australian couple is interested in adopting him. She begins to teach Saroo English and he moves to Hobart, Tasmania in 1987, under the care of Sue and John Brierley, where he slowly starts to settle in. A year later, they adopt another boy, Mantosh, who has trouble adjusting to his new home and suffers from rage and self-harm.
Twenty years later, Saroo, now a young man, moves to Melbourne to study hotel management. He starts a relationship with Lucy, an American student. During a meal with some Indian friends at their home, he comes across jalebi, a delicacy he remembers from his childhood. He confides that he is adopted, and his friends suggest he use Google Earth to search for his hometown in India. Saroo begins his search, but over time disconnects from Lucy, overwhelmed by the thought of emotions his family must have gone through when he was missing.
Saroo visits Sue, whose health is deteriorating, and learns that she is not infertile, but had chosen to help others in need through adoption, believing that there were already too many people on Earth. Saroo spends a long time searching fruitlessly for his hometown. One evening, while scanning Google Earth, he notices the rock formations where his mother worked, and then finds the area where he lived: the Ganesh Talai neighbourhood of the Khandwa district. He finally tells his adoptive mother about his search, and she fully supports his efforts.
Saroo returns to his hometown, and with the help of a local English speaker, has an emotional reunion with his biological mother and sister. He also learns that Guddu is dead, killed by a train the same night that they were separated at the station as children. Saroo's mother never gave up hope and believed that one day her missing son would return, and never moved away from the village. The film ends with captions about the real Saroo's return to India in February 2012. Photos of the real Australian family are shown, as well as footage of Saroo introducing Sue to his biological mother in India, who deeply appreciates Sue's care for her son. Saroo later learned that he had been mispronouncing his own name, which was actually Sheru, meaning ""lion""."
Their Finest,"The film is set in London in 1940. Catrin Cole is summoned to an interview at the Ministry of Information, where she is taken on to write scripts for short information films. Her husband Ellis Cole is a war artist, unable to secure an exhibition and exempted from conscription due to a Spanish Civil War leg wound. He is initially accepting of her job, but when she becomes the only wage earner he begins to feel threatened and plans to send her back home to Wales, on the pretence of keeping her safe from the London Blitz.
After a clash with the actor Ambrose Hilliard when he asks for a change to one of her scripts, Catrin's superiors send her to research a news story about twin sisters Lily and Rose sailing their father's boat to take part in the Dunkirk evacuation. She discovers that they had actually been mistakenly reported as reaching Dunkirk. In reality, their boat had engine trouble just off Southend-on-Sea shortly after setting off, and they had to be towed back into port by a tug that had taken part in the evacuation. At risk of losing her Ministry job and being sent back to Wales, Catrin lies to her superiors and they agree to make the film as ""The Nancy Starling,"" with Catrin, Tom Buckley, and Raymond Parfitt as the scriptwriters. They begin to write a scenario and, when their superiors discover the deception, convince them to continue the film as fiction rather than a documentary.
Hilliard's agent, Sammy, offers him the part of drunken ""Uncle Frank."" He refuses out of pride, but, after Sammy's death in an air raid, Hilliard is reluctantly won over by Sammy's sister Sophie, who has taken over his talent agency. Hilliard, initially put off by her businesslike approach, is won over as his public image improves. Initial location photography in Devon begins, but rapid rewrites prove necessary when an American character is added on the orders of the Secretary of State for War, to give the film more appeal in the US. The Secretary also orders that the character must be played by Carl Lundbeck, a handsome Norwegian-American pilot from an Eagle Squadron, who proved photogenic in silent film but unable to act in talkies. The film is saved by judicious editing, as well as by Catrin convincing Hilliard to give Lundbeck acting lessons in return for improvements to Hilliard's part.
Catrin and Buckley develop a combative friendship and affection during the location filming, but delays cause her to miss the opening of her husband's art exhibition. Just before leaving to see the exhibition's final day, Catrin reveals to Phyl that she is in fact Ellis's long-term lover and not his wife, having taken his name for the sake of propriety. She had run away with him; the ring she’s wearing she had purchased herself. When visiting London, she finds Ellis having sex with another woman and breaks up with him, going back to Devon. Buckley has found out about the nature of Catrin's marriage. He proposes to her, but she refuses and they argue. Soon after arriving in London for interior photography, Catrin changes her mind and rewrites the end of the script, making it clear to Tom that she loves him. They kiss, just before a stage hand asks Catrin to come answer a query from Hilliard about rewriting his character. Buckley goes to answer it instead of Catrin, but as he turns to look back at Catrin, he is killed by a falling lighting rig. With several actors including Hilliard injured, filming is delayed, and Lundbeck ends up having to return to his squadron. Hilliard is visited in hospital by Sophie, who suggests he should come and stay with her to convalesce. In the meantime, the producers fear the movie has to be scrapped, because there is no one to play the role of fixing the boat propeller in the movie.
A more US-audience-friendly ending is added and the gap in the film is filled by Catrin's suggestion that one of the twins, Rose, fix the boat's fouled propeller, instead of a male character; a change she had suggested from the very start. In shock and grief, Catrin withdraws from the world of film, but a visit from Hilliard convinces her to return, in part to write him fulfilling parts such as a cat burglar air-raid warden, now that he has accepted that he can no longer play matinee idol parts. She attends a screening of her film, and enjoys watching the audience reactions. She sees that a clip of her and Buckley has been added to the ending. After speaking to two moved members of the audience, she heads back to the scriptwriters office, sits down at Buckley's old desk, and starts working on her next film."
Denial,"Deborah Lipstadt is an American professor of Holocaust studies whose speaking engagement is disrupted by David Irving, a Nazi Germany scholar. He files a libel lawsuit in the United Kingdom against Lipstadt and her publisher for declaring him a Holocaust denier in her books. Since, in the UK, the burden of proof in a libel case lies with the accused, Lipstadt and her legal team led by solicitor Anthony Julius and barrister Richard Rampton must prove that Irving had lied about the Holocaust.
To prepare their defence, Lipstadt and Rampton tour the Auschwitz death camp in Poland with a local scholar, while the research team subpoenas Irving's extensive personal diaries. Lipstadt is annoyed by Rampton's apparently disrespectful questions on the subject, and frustrated when the team minimises her involvement in the case, arguing that she harms its chances of success. Members of the British Jewish community plead with her to settle out of court to avoid creating publicity for Irving. However, her team has a promising start when they persuade Irving, by appealing to his ego, to agree to a trial by judge instead of a jury, which he could have manipulated to his advantage.
Irving conducts his own legal representation, facing Lipstadt's legal team. Irving endeavours to twist the presented evidence for the defence. Lipstadt is approached by a Holocaust survivor who pleads for the chance to testify, but Lipstadt's legal team insists on focusing the trial on Irving.
Irving tries to discredit evidence for the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz, claiming there were no holes on the roof for the Zyklon B gas crystals to be introduced. His soundbite ""no holes, no holocaust"" dominates the media coverage. Furious, Lipstadt demands that she and the Holocaust survivors take the stand. Julius angrily counters that Irving would only humiliate and exploit a survivor on cross-examination, as he has in the past. Rampton visits Lipstadt at her home to explain his approach and earns her trust. In court, he subjects Irving to skilful cross-examination and exposes his claims as absurd, while expert testimony exposes the distortions in Irving's writings.
As the trial concludes, the judge, Charles Gray, worries the defence by suggesting that if Irving honestly believes his own claims, then he cannot be lying as Lipstadt asserted. Gray rules for the defence, convinced of the truth of Lipstadt's portrayal of Irving as deceitful. Lipstadt is hailed for her dignified demeanour, while her legal team reminds her that despite her silence during the trial, it was her writing that countered Irving's lies and provided the basis for the victory. At a press conference, Lipstadt praises her lawyers for their strategy."
City of Tiny Lights,"Tommy Akhtar, the son of immigrants, works as a snoop in London. Melody Chase visits him to ask him to look for her missing roommate Natasha, a Russian prostitute. Tommy steals a keycard from the cleaning staff and sneaks into the hotel room where she met her last client but only finds the dead body of Usman Rana, a Pakistani businessman. Tommy takes the dead man's mobile phone as evidence, calls the police with an anonymous tip about the murder from a payphone at a bar, and has the phone's PIN cracked by a Avid, young weed dealer whose mother wants Tommy to help him get out of trouble. Two of the last calls made from the phone were to Hafiz ""Lovely"" Ansari, a childhood friend of Tommy's, to discuss an investment. Tommy visits him at his home and Lovely asks him to investigate the matter because the murder is scaring away other investors.
Tommy learns from a police contact that by the time the police arrived the room had been cleaned and the hotel was crawling with SO15. The SIM card in the phone is decrypted and found to contain a spreadsheet documenting large donations to the Islamic Youth League. Tommy visits the organisation and is photographed doing so by the SO15. The leader of the organisation indicates that Usman's death was the will of Allah as punishment for the false idols and lustful desires of Western society. After leaving, Tommy is approached by an American federal agent in a bar who tells him that he knows that Tommy was at the hotel and that he called in the anonymous tip and warns Tommy to stay away from the investigation. Tommy speaks with Tunde, one of the men working at Natasha's club the night she was last seen, and learns that Melody was with one of her regular clients there the night of the murder. As he leaves he is assaulted by two strangers who scream that the case is closed before fleeing.
Tommy begins sending Avid to the Islamic Youth League to gather information. Tommy is abducted in a black van and taken to speak with the federal agent, who shows him a video of Usman calling for jihad and takes him to a crime scene to show him the freshly discovered body of Natasha. Tommy returns to Melody and confronts her. She says that she is being followed and confesses that the customer with her the night of the murder was Hafiz. As they are leaving, a stranger shoots at them from the elevator. They escape to Tommy's father's house, where Tommy looks at the spreadsheet and discovers large profits being made from property acquisitions at low prices. The next day Mullah Al-Dabaran, the leader of the Islamic Youth League, is arrested. His followers protest in demonstrations demanding his release, where Hafiz attempts to calm them. Tommy warns Hafiz that the people from the night of the murder are being killed. When Avid is attacked by American federal agents and put into a coma, Avid's mother blames Tommy for getting him involved.
Tommy returns home, where he finds Hafiz and another man holding Melody prisoner at gunpoint. Hafiz confesses to using drug dealers to bring property prices down then allowing the Islamic Youth League to run off the drug dealers to enable him to buy the properties at a low price. Tommy's father returns and shoots the man with the gun but Tommy convinces him to hand over the gun rather than shoot Hafiz as well. Hafiz is then arrested.
In the closing scene, Tommy returns home to eat with his father, Melody, Avid, Shelley and Emma."
The Exception,"During World War II, Captain Stefan Brandt (Jai Courtney) is sent to head the personal bodyguard of exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II (Christopher Plummer) at his home in Utrecht, Netherlands. Following the invasion, Nazi authorities are concerned that Dutch spies may be watching Wilhelm. Upon arriving at the residence, Brandt is drawn into an unexpected and passionate romance with Mieke de Jong (Lily James), one of the maids; Mieke soon reveals to Brandt that she is secretly Jewish. Gestapo Inspector Dietrich (Mark Dexter) informs Brandt that the British Secret Service have an agent in a nearby village. In addition to keeping an eye on the Kaiser, Brandt is to determine and report the identity of the agent. It turns out to be Mieke, who reports to a pastor at the local church on events at the Kaiser's home. When SS Commander Heinrich Himmler (Eddie Marsan) decides to visit with a large SS platoon, Brandt is forced to choose between following the Nazi party agenda and protecting Mieke.
As his involvement with Mieke continues, Brandt notices a smell of gun oil from her room. He later sees Mieke leaving the residence grounds and follows. Mieke visits again the pastor and, unaware that Brandt is watching outside a window, tells the pastor that she is prepared to assassinate Himmler (as revenge for the SS killing her father and husband). The SS then intercept the pastor’s radio transmissions to Britain; they arrest and mercilessly beat the pastor. Shortly after, Wilhelm's wife Hermine (Janet McTeer) discovers the lovers’ affair and notifies Wilhelm, expecting him to dismiss Mieke and discipline Brandt. However, Wilhelm supports the relationship; in private, he reveals to the lovers that he fathered illegitimate children prior to meeting Hermine.
When the time comes to have the house searched before Himmler's arrival, Brandt himself searches Mieke's room to protect her ruse. After Himmler’s arrival, Brandt learns that the pastor has revealed Mieke as the British agent; he locates and urges her to go. She refuses, insisting that she has a duty. Meanwhile, Himmler extends to Wilhelm an invitation from Hitler to return to Berlin. He then meets with Brandt and Dietrich, informing them of the gesture and its intention as a trap to expose and eradicate supporters of the monarchy restoration. Against orders, Brandt passes the information along to Wilhelm’s adjutant, Colonel Sigurd von Ilsemann (Ben Daniels).
Mieke does her duty and imparts to Wilhelm a message from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Wilhelm is offered asylum in Great Britain and will be restored to the German throne after the defeat of the Nazis; he refuses, preferring not to leave Utrecht. As the Gestapo closes in on the mansion, searching for Mieke, Brandt devises an escape plan. Wilhelm, Mieke and Brandt escape in a van with Wilhelm pretending to have had a heart attack; Brandt kills Dietrich and another suspicious officer in the process. Deep in the woods, Mieke decides to flee, asking Brandt to join her; she fears he will be executed for the murders. Brandt, however, insists that he has a duty to Germany and a protective alibi (he brought Wilhelm to hospital, while Mieke killed the officers and escaped). The two decide to part ways, with Mieke telling Brandt to find her after the war. As Mieke departs, Brandt repeats a marriage proposal that Mieke had earlier refused in fear. This time, she accepts, and disappears into the woods.
Some time later, Brandt is seen at a desk in a Berlin office. He is delivered a package, which contains a book of Nietzsche writings that Mieke had shown him; inside is written a London address. In London, Mieke is seated on a park bench when she is informed that the Prime Minister is ready to see her. Rising, Mieke puts her hand on her belly; she is pregnant. In Brandt’s office, an air raid siren sounds. Though others evacuate, Brandt remains seated, reading Mieke’s book; a plane is heard flying overhead as the screen cuts to black."
Don't Knock Twice,"Jess, an American sculptor, meets with her estranged daughter Chloe and invites her to come live with her and her husband, a wealthy banker named Ben. Chloe refuses the offer. That night, she goes out with her friend Danny to a neighborhood empty of homes except for one, where legend says a demonic witch lives. The two knock twice on the door and leave. Upon returning home, Danny starts experiencing strange paranormal occurrences. The disturbances stop when Chloe video calls Danny. Before they can converse, Chloe hears knocks on her door and when she leaves to answer them, Danny is seen in the video being dragged by an unseen force. When the demonic spirit frightens Chloe in her foster home, she accepts Jess' offer and moves in with her and Ben.
Chloe is initially hostile to her family and only plans to stay for a few nights. Strange events start to unfold, beginning when Chloe finds a human molar in her Coriander soup. Jess is suffering from a nightmare about an old woman crying in her house. In her nightmare, the woman looks at Jess and says,""Przepraszam"" then slit her own throat, which scares Jess awake. Jess tells Chloe about her dream and finding this description familiar, Chloe tells Jess about a woman they nicknamed ""Ginger"", a supposed witch that used to live next door. After her death by suicide, they began the urban legend that she would come and get you if you knocked twice on her door. Jess dismisses this as a bad dream. While sculpting, Jess' model Tira is disturbed by Chloe's presence and leaves, claiming that there is darkness around her. Chloe believes that it is Baba Yaga haunting her, but she is ignored by Jess.
While sculpting with Jess, Chloe slowly warms up to her mother. Jess returns to her workshop to see that her sculptures had moved and she believes that Chloe did it in the mere seconds that she had been out of the room to get two soft drinks. The next day, Jess returns to her workshop and discovers it in shambles with ""She's mine"" scrawled on the floor in what appears to be red paint. That night, the two are terrorized by the witch and they resort to burning down all the doors. The next day, a portal opened and Chloe is dragged inside before being saved by Jess. They meet with Tira, who says that Mary was never a witch and that she committed suicide. Because Chloe helped spread the false rumor of witchcraft, Mary's spirit wants revenge. Chloe panics and runs off, convinced by Tira's words that the disappearances were her fault and she spends the night on the street where she is found and returned to the foster home. Jess goes there to get her back and while there, she has a sudden epiphany that the true culprit of the disappearances was not Mary but Detective Boardman. As she and Chloe escape, they are surprised by the sound of two knocks coming from what appears to be a door to the sewers on the sidewalk which then suddenly opens, and Chloe is taken by the witch.
After Chloe's disappearance, Jess breaks into Mary's abandoned house, injuring her foot on an old nail. Unfortunately, she is caught and sent to the police station, but not before getting to knock twice at the door herself. Jess accuses detective Boardman of the crimes that Mary had been accused of, but gets no answers. When she is finally alone in her prison cell, she uses blood from her wounded foot to leave a message on the wall before being taken through the same portal that previously appeared. She wanders through the vast woods into a cave where she finds a cage hanging from the ceiling with Chloe in it. Jess gets her out and rushes to escape with her as the witch pursues them; meanwhile, Detective Boardman has arrived at the witch's house and proceeds to knock twice, causing the door to open on its own. He enters the home, having heard the sounds of Jess and Chloe's voices. Chloe and Jess are able to escape through the front door, but Detective Boardman is dragged inside by the witch.
Jess's husband Ben returns home, worried by the disarray he finds inside and immediately begins looking for Jess but is confronted by a mysterious figure in their bedroom. Jess and Chloe arrive back at home, noticing Ben's things in the entrance, but cannot find him anywhere. As Jess calls Ben's phone and leaves him a voicemail, Tira is shown leaving the property covered in blood with Ben's dead body in the trunk of her car. She changes her bloody clothes and the ""Babayaga slave symbol"" is shown on her chest for a brief moment before disappearing. Jess informs Chloe that Detective Boardman was the culprit of the crimes, but Chloe corrects her by telling Jess that while in the other world, she saw Michael and that he was indeed taken by Mary and fed to the Babayaga and that Detective Boardman was innocent. It's then that Jess recalls what Chloe told her about the Babayaga and its human slave and she realizes that Tira lied to her and tricked her into offering Detective Boardman's life to the Babayaga in order to transfer the demon to Jess.
Jess is surprised by a sudden burning sensation from her necklace and realizes that she now has the mark of the Babayaga. The room suddenly goes dark and there are two knocks at the door, as it opens, the figure of the Babayaga reaching towards them is the last thing seen before the film ends."
Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children,"For years, Abraham Portman has told stories to his grandson Jake about his childhood surviving in World War II, battling monsters and living at a secret home for children in Cairnholm, Wales. According to Abe, the home's children and their headmistress Miss Alma Peregrine possess paranormal abilities and are known as ""Peculiars"". When Jacob turns sixteen, Jake responds to a panicked phone call from Abe, and goes to his house to find him dying with his eyes removed. Abe tells him to go to ""the loop of September 3, 1943"". After Abe dies, Jake glimpses a monster exactly like the ones described in Abe's stories hiding in the forest.
Jake's parents sign him up for psychiatrist check-ups, and following advice from his psychiatrist, Dr. Golan, and the lead of a letter from Miss Peregrine to Abe, Jake travels to Cairnholm with his father to investigate the children's home, whereupon he learns that it was destroyed during a Luftwaffe raid. However upon visiting the ruined house, he finds the children there alive and well. They take him through a portal in a cave and he emerges in the year 1943 when the house was still intact. Miss Peregrine greets him and explains that she belongs to a class of female Peculiars called ""Ymbrynes"" who can shapeshift into birds (in Miss Peregrine's case, a peregrine falcon) and manipulate time. To avoid persecution, she and the children hide from the outside world in a time loop she created, accessible only to Peculiars and set to September 3, 1943. This time loop allows them to live the same day repeatedly and avoid aging as long as they stay inside of it.
Jake is introduced to the rest of the children, including aerokinetic Emma Bloom, to whom he is attracted. Jake learns that he himself is a Peculiar and, like Abe, has the ability to see the invisible monsters from Abe's stories, ""Hollowgast"" (or ""Hollows""). Hollows are invisible disfigured Peculiar scientists that resulted from killing an Ymbryne in a failed experiment to become immortal by harvesting her powers. Led by shapeshifter Mr. Barron, they hunt Peculiars to consume their eyeballs, which allows them to become ""Wights"", Hollows with regained visible human forms, but with milky-white eyes.
A wounded Ymbryne named Miss Avocet arrives and explains that Barron and the Hollows and Wights raided her January 2016 time loop at Blackpool, England, killed her children, and is trying to repeat his failed experiment by using more Ymbrynes. Jake realized earlier that a Hollow could be in the island after he sees eyeless sheep corpses in the present. Worried, Miss Peregrine decides to move out with her children and Miss Avocet. Jake returns to 2016 and realizes the Hollow is even closer after another victim was killed, so he goes back to the cave to warn his friends. However, he is followed by another visitor on the island, ornithologist John Lamont who reveals himself to be a disguise for Mr. Barron.
Barron reveals that he was about to gain Miss Peregrine's loop from Abe, but his hungry Hollow companion Mr. Malthus killed him before he could. Barron then posed as Dr. Golan and encouraged Jake to go to the island so he could find the loop. Using Jake as a hostage at the children's home, Barron forces Miss Peregrine to trap herself in bird form and takes her to Blackpool, leaving Jake, the children, and Miss Avocet as prey for Malthus. Malthus arrives and kills Miss Avocet, but Jake and the children escape just as the Luftwaffe bomb is about to destroy the house. Without Miss Peregrine to reset it, the house is destroyed and the loop closes, leaving Jake and the children stuck in 1943, but safe from Malthus, who is killed in the explosion. Rescuing a sunken ocean liner, they travel to Blackpool and enter its January 2016 loop, fight Barron's Wight and Hollow allies, and rescue Miss Peregrine and other captive Ymbrynes. Barron disguises himself as Jake, hoping to confuse the children who have come to finish him off. When the last remaining Hollow arrives it mistakes Barron for Jake and kills him, and is in turn killed by Jake.
Before the time loop closes, Emma tells Jake that because of Miss Peregrine's injury in the battle, the children will live in 1943 and that they will handle the Hollows. Jake says goodbye to them as they exit and return to their ship in 1943, while he stays in his year of 2016. He travels back to Florida and relates his adventures to his grandfather, who is alive and well, as Barron’s death in the beginning of 2016 erased his presence in Florida later on. Abe gives Jake a map of international time loops and money from different countries and urges him to seek out Emma.
After months of searching and traveling, Jake reaches Emma and the children in 1943. Emma and Jake confess their feelings, and start traveling along with Miss Peregrine and the other children, searching for a new home."
Mindhorn,"Actor Richard Thorncroft is best known for playing Detective Bruce Mindhorn, a detective with the power to see truth with a cybernetic eye, in the 1980s television show Mindhorn. Twenty-five years later, on the Isle of Man, where Mindhorn was filmed, police hunt an escaped lunatic, Paul Melly, wanted for murder. Melly says he will only speak to Detective Mindhorn, not realising that Mindhorn is fictional.
Richard is now washed up and reduced to adverting embarrassing products. Hoping to boost his career, he returns to the Isle of Man to help the case but irritates the local constabulary with his arrogance. Melly's scheduled call to the police station leads to a meeting with Melly, culminating in Melly's arrest. Richard sets out to reconnect with his Mindhorn co-star Patricia, but discovers she is living with his former stuntman Clive, and Patricia and Richard's estranged daughter Jasmine. Another of his Mindhorn co-stars, Pete Eastman, now stars in a successful spin-off series. Dejected, Richard is detained after a night of drunken antisocial behaviour and dropped by his agent.
Waiting for his ferry home, Richard opens fan mail, including a videotape revealing that the murder was committed by the mayor. His former manager Moncrieff proposes using the tape to blackmail the mayor, but appears to concede after a brief altercation. Richard meets Melly and the police, but discovers that Moncrieff has swapped the tape. Moncrieff confronts the mayor but is shot by DC Baines, who is part of the conspiracy.
Melly and Richard escape to Melly's secret lair, which is filled with Mindhorn merchandise and homemade espionage equipment. Melly equips Richard with an extensive Mindhorn outfit and explains that he has a copy of the tape in the car used in Mindhorn. Richard and Melly escape Baines when Melly throws defective Mindhorn merchandise in her face.
At Patricia and Clive's house, Richard learns that Clive has been hiding letters to Patricia from Richard. Richard, Melly and Patricia hijack the car from a parade, and are pursued by DC Baines to the beach. Richard discovers the tape is a plasticine model and Melly is hit by a bullet. Richard captures a confession from Baines on an old Mindhorn recorder belt that Melly had insisted he wear. Richard rescues Jasmine from Baines as she fires at him; realizing too late the gun she was firing was not loaded with blanks as he thought, Richard collapses. He survives, Baines and the mayor are jailed, and Melly is found alive in his lair."
Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"Billy Lynn, a 19-year old US Army Specialist from Texas, is caught on camera dragging wounded sergeant Virgil ""Shroom"" Breem to safety during an intense firefight in Iraq on October 23, 2004. This act of courage earns Lynn the Silver Star and quickly ascends him and his unit, erroneously designated ""Bravo Squad"" by the media, to celebrity status. They return to the U.S. for Shroom's funeral, then are sent on a publicity tour culminating at the halftime show of the November 25 Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving home game.
Now led by Sgt. David Dime, the members of Bravo Squad are driven in a limousine to the stadium with the Cowboys' PR representative Josh and film producer Albert Brown, who is in the process of securing a film deal for the squad. A flashback reveals that Billy joined the army after destroying the car of his older sister Kathryn's boyfriend, who left her after she was in a car accident that required multiple facial reconstruction procedures. At the stadium, the group is greeted by anxious fans who express gratitude for their actions and blindly support the Iraq War. During a press conference, Billy spots a Cowboys Cheerleader, Faison, smiling at him. They strike up up a conversation and begin a flirtation. Billy tells her how it feels weird to be honored for the worst day of his life.
As the game starts, Billy recalls his time in Iraq, where Shroom offered him philosophical insight and advice during their downtime. It is revealed that once the game ends, Bravo Squad will have to return to duty. Billy receives a phone call from a doctor that Kathryn spoke to in regards to trying to have him honorably discharged so that he does not have to go back to Iraq, to spare him further suffering.
During the halftime show, featuring Destiny's Child, the loud music and pyrotechnics traumatize an already unstable squad member, Crack, and he reacts violently against a security guard. Billy experiences a flashback to the battle that made them famous. The squad was called in to rescue soldiers pinned down by insurgents at a school. Shroom is shot while advancing from cover, and Billy rushes to save him, firing on the nearby insurgents with his sidearm. Billy drags Shroom into a trench, but further violence occurs at close quarters. Billy is traumatized in the aftermath, and Shroom bleeds to death.
Billy and Dime meet with the owner of the Cowboys, Norm Oglesby, who is considering investing in Albert's movie about the incident in Iraq. However, instead of the offer of $100,000 to each member of the squad that Albert was aiming for, Oglesby has reduced it to $5,500 apiece. Dime angrily rebuffs his offer. In private, Oglesby tells Billy that this story is no longer his, but instead belongs to the U.S. people. Billy tells off Oglesby, joining Dime. Albert promises Billy that he will find investors one way or another, and that their story deserves to be told ""the right way.""
As the squad leaves, they are attacked by the security guards from earlier, briefly triggering Billy's PTSD, which fills his mind with surreal imagery of war and death. The altercation is halted, and Billy meets up with Faison briefly before leaving. He says he wishes he could run away with her even though he has to go back. They share a kiss before parting ways. Kathryn arrives to retrieve Billy, but his expression makes it clear he is returning to duty. She is upset, but after Billy explains his decision, the siblings share a tearful hug.
Billy gets into the limousine, which he hallucinates is a Humvee, where he has a philosophical conversation with (a visible) Shroom. Billy tells Shroom ""I love you"", breaking back to the reality of the limo and Bravo Squad, who each respond with ""I love you""."

After Bob returns, James feels he is ready to come off the methadone. After a week of withdrawal symptoms, James awakes, clean and healthy. A journalist, Mary, requests to write a book about James and Bob after his Internet and media popularity, and James agrees. James then fixes up his relationship with his father Jack, and his life turns around for the better."
Allied,"In 1942 during World War II, Wing Commander Max Vatan, a Royal Canadian Air Force pilot serving on intelligence duties, travels to Casablanca in Morocco to assassinate the German ambassador. He is partnered with a French Resistance fighter named Marianne Beauséjour, who had escaped from France after her resistance group was compromised and killed.
The two pose as a married couple and grow close, despite agreeing that in their line of work feelings can get people killed. Marianne, who is trusted by the Germans, secures Max an invitation to the party where they plan to conduct the assassination. On the day itself, they have sex inside a car in the middle of a desert sandstorm, knowing that they might not survive. However, the mission is successful and they both escape. Max asks Marianne to come with him to London and be his wife. The two get married, settle down in Hampstead, and have a baby girl named Anna, who was born during a bombing raid.
A year later, Max learns from the Special Operations Executive that Marianne is suspected of being a German spy, having adopted her identity after the real Marianne was killed in France. In order to test their suspicions, SOE runs a ""blue dye"" operation: Max is ordered to write down a piece of false intelligence at home, where Marianne can find it. If the information is picked up from intercepted German transmissions, Max must personally execute her, or be hanged for high treason. Max is told otherwise to act normally.
Defying orders, Max visits a former colleague named Guy Sangster who knew Marianne, but, blind from a wartime injury, cannot confirm her identity. However, Sangster reveals that the resistance fighter Paul Delamare worked with Marianne in France and would be able to identify her. Max then seeks out a young pilot named Adam Hunter, gives him a photograph and instructs him to ask Delamare whether his wife is really Marianne.
Max and Marianne host a party one night, during which Max hears from a colleague that the operation might be a test, before he is given a vital job in the run-up to D-Day. Max's commanding officer Frank Heslop tells him that Hunter was killed while waiting on the ground for the answer. Max then notices Marianne talking to a local storeowner in the kitchen. Marianne tells Max it was a local jeweller trying to sell her a brooch. He runs outside and catches the salesman, and deceptively asks about the earrings, but the salesman corrects Max that it was indeed a brooch. Max later tells Heslop that the ""blue dye"" operation could be a high level test; Frank denies it, but Max suggests that he could not know, because it would be above Frank's pay grade. Frank urges Max to continue the ""blue dye"" operation.
The following evening, Max takes the place of a Lysander pilot and flies to France to meet with Delamare, who is being held at the local police station. Max and the local resistance break into the town's local jail and detain the lone officer. Delamare is drunk and cannot verify the picture. The delay allows time for the French police officer to alert the Germans, which Max and his team manage to defeat. Prior to leaving, Max is informed by Delamare that Marianne was a talented pianist who had played ""La Marseillaise"", the French national anthem, in defiance of occupying Germans in the early stages of the war.
Back in England, Max takes Marianne to a local pub and demands she play the piano. Marianne cannot, and admits she is a spy and forwarded the ""blue dye"" message which Max left in plain view. She claims her feelings for Max are genuine and that she and her child were being threatened by German spies in London, including the woman who lives around the corner and often looks after Anna.
Max, unwilling to kill his wife, tells her they need to leave before the SOE catches them. He declares they only have one hour. He then retrieves Anna and kills Marianne's handlers - the nanny and the jeweler. Max uses his credentials to get onto the airbase to flee the country via airplane. Max cannot get the plane to start prior to the arrival of the military police. Commanding officer Frank Heslop calmly drives his own vehicle into the plane's propeller just as Max finally gets the plane engine running well. Marianne wraps up Anna in a blanket and says goodbye to her, and then gets out of the car to tell Max that she loves him and asks him to take care of Anna, before pulling out a concealed handgun and shoots herself under the chin. Heslop orders the soldiers present to report that Max executed Marianne as per his orders, so that Max himself will not be punished.
After the war, Max moves to the ranch in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada, which was always his ambition, and raises Anna. The film ends with a flashback of Marianne reading the letter that she had earlier written to her daughter, anticipating that one day her real identity would be uncovered."
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"In 1926, British wizard and ""magizoologist"" Newt Scamander arrives by ship to New York en route to Arizona. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a No-Maj woman who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. As Newt listens to her speech about how witches and wizards are real and dangerous, a Niffler escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted Auror Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for the chaos caused by the Niffler and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.
After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her Legilimens sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to marry or even meet No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained Obscurus, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died, those afflicted rarely living past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After re-capturing two of the three escaped beasts, they re-enter the suitcase, which Tina returns to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing Senator Henry Shaw, Jr. Director of Magical Security Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death, but Queenie and Jacob rescue them, and they escape after retrieving Newt's suitcase. Following a tip from Tina's old goblin informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the creatures.
Meanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou's adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, whom he assumes is the Obscurus's host, he dismisses Credence as being a Squib and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.
Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society; however, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs and framing Newt for it, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. After being subdued by one of Newt's beasts, he is revealed as Grindelwald in disguise and is taken into custody.
MACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his Thunderbird to disperse a poultice as rainfall over the city that erases all New Yorkers' recent memories as MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories. Newt departs for Europe, but promises to return and visit Tina when his book is finished; he also anonymously leaves Jacob a case of silver Occamy eggshells to fund his bakery. His breads and pastries are unconsciously inspired by Newt's creatures, and Queenie visits him in his shop."
Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,"Dr. James Marcus, the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter who was dying of premature aging. Desperate to save her, Marcus discovered the T-virus. Unfortunately, the virus had the side effect of sudden and uncontrollable mutation; in Cape Town, South Africa, a boy dies in a cable car ascending to Table Mountain, then reanimates and kills the other passengers. Marcus tried to have the program shut down, despite protests from his colleague Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen). When Marcus refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker to kill him. The Red Queen is then created using childhood images of Marcus' daughter.
Some time after the events of the previous film, Alice awakens in the now-ruined White House after being betrayed once again by Wesker. While she is searching for survivors, the Red Queen appears and tells Alice she must return to the Hive, over 400 miles west on I-64 in Raccoon City, within 48 hours. The Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which can kill every organism infected by the T-virus (which may or may not include Alice), and is just waiting for the remaining few thousand humans to be wiped out. When asked why she is betraying her creators, the Red Queen says that she will explain once Alice arrives at the Hive.
On her way to Raccoon City, Alice is captured by Isaacs — learning the one she previously killed was just a clone — though she manages to escape his convoy. Alice later arrives in Raccoon City and is ambushed by a group of survivors, consisting of Doc, Abigail, Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Alice's friend Claire Redfield, who survived the attack on Arcadia. With Isaacs' convoy approaching, trailed by a horde of zombies, the group prepares for battle. They defeat the convoy, retrieve Isaacs' few human captives and burn the horde, though Cobalt is killed. With more undead on the way and no defenses left, Alice and crew head for the Hive entrance, located at the bottom of the crater from the nuclear bomb dropped on the city. Wesker, having taken control of the Hive, releases mutated guard dogs, killing Christian and a freed captive.
Inside the Hive, the Red Queen appears to Alice and explains her reason for betraying Umbrella. She reveals that a video was uploaded to her program which contained the recording of Isaacs explaining to Umbrella's executives the plan to release the T-virus, cleansing the world of man-made catastrophes while saving the rich and powerful in cryogenic capsules hidden in the Hive, and later rebuild the world in their image. The Red Queen program is in conflict, as she can never hurt an Umbrella employee but also must value remaining human life, which is why she enlists Alice's help in order to stop Isaacs. Before proceeding onwards, Alice is silently warned by The Red Queen that someone in her group is a spy for Umbrella.
Navigating the Hive, the group encounter several traps, resulting in the deaths of Abigail and Razor along with the remaining freed captive. Alice and Doc plant bombs throughout the Hive taken from the leftover equipment of the original team to investigate the Hive. Alice confronts the real (tech-upgraded) Isaacs, whereupon she is held at gunpoint by Doc — Umbrella's spy — while Claire is captured by Wesker. A cryogenic capsule opens, releasing Alicia Marcus, Umbrella's co-leader and Marcus' daughter. Isaacs reveals to Alice that she is actually a clone of Alicia, before going on to explain his plan in eliminating the pair so that he can assume full control of Umbrella. Though Issacs is the co-founder of Umbrella, Alicia points out that Wesker is merely an employee and proceeds to ""fire"" him, allowing the Red Queen to crush his legs with a security door. Doc tries to shoot Alice, but he finds his gun empty — as Alice had earlier deduced his treachery — and Claire executes him. After giving Wesker the deadman's switch to the bombs she planted, Alice and Claire pursue Isaacs while Alicia willingly stays behind to review her childhood memories with her father.
Upon catching up to Isaacs, Alice and Claire fight him as the trio are lifted back up to the Hive. Isaacs overpowers Claire and attacks Alice in the Laser Corridor. Alice manages to dodge the lasers before re-engaging Isaacs, eventually beating him when she secretly activates a grenade in his pocket. She escapes to the surface with the anti-virus, but Isaacs reboots and follows; he catches her just as she's about to release the antivirus. Before he can kill Alice, however, Isaacs is confronted and instantly killed by his clone, which Alice encountered en route to Raccoon City; the clone is then devoured by the undead. The distraction allows Alice to release the antivirus, killing all of the undead around her before she passes out. Wesker simultaneously drops the deadman's switch, destroying the Hive along with the hibernating Umbrella elite; Alicia and Wesker are killed in the process.
Claire wakes Alice, who survived because the antivirus killed only the T-virus within her body, not the healthy cells. The Red Queen gives Alice an upload of all of Alicia's memories, granting her a childhood. Alice travels into Manhattan, saying that the antivirus, carried only by the winds, will take years to reach all corners of the globe. Until then, says Alice, her mission is not finished."
The Hippopotamus,"Edward ""Ted"" Wallace (Roger Allam) is an aging, jaded writer and former poet. Having not written a poem since 1987, he is stuck writing reviews of small-time plays, wallowing in his bath, and compulsively drinking. After a dispute at a poorly-performed play leads to him being fired from his position as a critic, Ted runs into his goddaughter Jane, who lavishly pays him to investigate a series of miracles occurring at her family's manor in light of her unexplained apparent recovery from leukemia.
At the manor, owned by his former friend Lord Michael Logan, Ted becomes acquainted with his sixteen-year-old godson, David, who displays an unusual amount of fascination with both sex and nature. Also at the manor is David's brother Simon, Michael's angina-afflicted friend Oliver, who hopes to obtain funding for his upcoming play, and Valerie Richmond, a wealthy Frenchwoman who seeks to purchase one of the manor's horses, Lilac, for her socially awkward daughter Clara, who is accompanying her. For the next few days, Ted becomes acquainted with the manor's residents, encountering conflict between his abrasive attitude and the others' perky optimism, while David converses with Ted about both his interests and his ambitions of becoming a fellow poet.
One day, Lilac mysteriously falls ill of what appears to be ragwort poisoning, something which strikes Michael and Simon as odd since ragwort doesn't grow in the area. While Michael and company despair over the possibility of having to euthanize Lilac, Ted learns from various members of his godfamily that the miracles he was sent to investigate were performed by David himself. According to this account, David had healed his mother from a severe asthma attack simply by touching her when Simon's CPR seemed ineffective, and cured Jane's leukemia over the course of a few days through the same method. The following day, David appears to perform more miracles by curing Lilac's ragwood poisoning and Oliver's angina, leading Valerie to pursue him in hopes of improving Clara's appearance. David, however, has gone missing, leading to a widespread search across the manor's grounds. Ted eventually sights David and Clara running into the woods afterwards and gives chase, only to find Clara performing fellatio on David. A bewildered Ted simply chooses to observe them as an ejaculating David tries to coerce Clara into swallowing his semen; Simon then discovers the pair and interrupts them, leading a panicked Clara to bite David's penis. After Simon takes Clara back to the manor, Ted comes out of hiding and drives a bleeding David to the hospital. On the way back, David explains to Ted that he believes his healing powers come from his moral purity and a spiritual connection with nature, channeled though his hands and especially his bodily fluids; Ted rebukes all of this as blind delusion, leading a heartbroken David to abandon him. Once Ted returns to the manor, he is confronted by Michael's ex-fiance Geraldine, who bears a grudge against Ted for him publicly humiliating Ted on live television many years prior; Geraldine insults Ted and rebukes him for his interventions in Michael's family's life, leaving Ted to sulk alone in his room for the rest of the night. However, he comes to an unexpected realization when he accidentally knocks over and smashes his whiskey bottle.
The following evening, the manor's residents agree to publicly announce David's miraculous healing abilities, only for Ted to refute all of them as mere coincidence. Ted explains that the breaking of his whiskey bottle led him to realize that Lilac's poisoning was actually a hangover from drinking the contents of a bottle he dropped in an outdoor bucket from earlier in the film, that Simon's CPR had proved effective in rescuing his mother during her asthma attack, and that Jane's recovery from leukemia was actually a natural quieting of its symptoms. Ted further reveals David's confidence in his semen's abilities, and that this led him to have morally-dubious sex with Jane, Lilac, and Oliver. Ted's acidic lecture both disgusts and angers the residents of the manor and leads an eavesdropping David to attempt suicide by burying himself alive. However, the others discover David's absence and rescue him in the nick of time, before Ted is forced to deliver the unfortunate news that Jane's leukemia has killed her.
Some time passes, and the group has moved on from the events of that night. At Jane's funeral, David explains to Ted that his new ""normal"" life is one of hard work, and Ted's experiences from the summer at Michael's manor have reignited his sense of wonder; having written five new poems for the first time in nearly 30 years and preparing to write a sixth, a solitary Ted ushers a toast ""to miracles."""
The Discovery,"The film opens with an interview with Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford), the man who scientifically proved the existence of an afterlife, which has led to an extremely high suicide rate. The interviewer (Mary Steenburgen) asks Harbor if he feels responsible, to which he says no. Directly after, a member of the crew kills himself on air.
On the two year anniversary of the discovery, Harbor's son Will (Jason Segel) travels on a ferry where he meets Isla (Rooney Mara). They have a conversation and Will notes Isla looks very familiar. He says he is upset that people keep killing themselves, while Isla thinks it's an easy way out. Will also shares a memory he had while being dead for a minute, where he saw a young boy at a beach.
Will is picked up by his brother Toby (Jesse Plemons), who drives him to an isolated mansion where their father has built up his new station. Will notes people working for him, and Toby says they all attempted suicide. They enter a room where Will meets Lacey (Riley Keough) and Cooper (Ron Canada), and sees his father tied up to a machine as they kill and revive him. Will blames him for the high suicide rate.
Later, Will sees Isla on the beach as she walks into the water with a backpack loaded down by a gym weight. He runs after, barely saving her. He brings her to the mansion, where she is taken in. At a later meeting with the occupants, Thomas reveals he invented a machine that can record what dead people see in the afterlife, which requires a dead person, and they steal the corpse of Pat Phillips (Paul Bellefeuille) from the morgue.
Will reveals to Isla that his mother killed herself when he was younger. The next day, they try to record the afterlife but nothing happens. After the failed attempt, Will enters the room alone and puts back a piece of wiring he took out of the machine, which then shows a sequence of Pat Phillips driving to a hospital, visiting someone and fighting with a woman there. Will finds the hospital from the recording online and visits it, but finds that the hallway from the video is gone after remodeling a decade prior.
Later, during a meeting, Thomas brings Lacey on stage and confronts her about telling other people in the mansion about the failed device and tells her to leave immediately. Will drives Isla to the hospital and shows her the recording and tells her that he thinks the device records memory rather than the afterlife. After breaking into the hospital, they find a file from Pat Phillips' father, who died in the hospital.
Isla finds out that the man in the recording has a different tattoo from the one she saw on Pat earlier. Will drives her to the beach, where she reveals to him that she had a son and that he died while she was asleep. Later they seek out the woman from the video, revealed to be Pat's sister Janice (M.J. Karmi). She tells them that Pat left her alone with their dying father and that he never visited him in the hospital.
Isla and Will grow closer together and share a kiss, which is interrupted by Toby. Together they rush to Thomas, who is hooked up on the machine and dead. They observe that he is seeing the night their mother killed herself, except that Thomas stops her. They are able to revive Thomas, who concludes that the afterlife is an alternate version of their existing life, only with different choices made. They agree to destroy the machine, as this revelation would provoke millions of suicides by people wanting to improve the lives they have. Thomas prepares to hold a speech, which is interrupted by Lacey shooting Isla, claiming she has just ""relocated"" her. Isla dies in Will's arms.
Later, a devastated Will hooks himself up with the machine. He arrives back on the ferry, where he meets Isla again, who states that this is a memory. It is revealed that Will is living in a memory loop trying to prevent Isla's death and that he restarts on the ferry every time. Isla says that he saved her and that they both will move on now. Although Toby and Thomas try to revive Will, he dies, promising Isla to remember her.
Will stands on the beach, where he sees a little boy and gets him out of the water. The little boy's mother, Isla, arrives and thanks Will. They don't recognize each other. After she leaves, he walks away, but starting to recall who Isla is, he slowly stops and looks back."
Wind River,"During a winter season in Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, expert tracker and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agent Cory Lambert discovers the frozen body of 18-year-old Natalie Hanson who was barefoot, without proper winter attire, miles from any building, and had a blood-stained groin. FBI special agent Jane Banner arrives to investigate a possible homicide. The next day, Jane learns from Natalie's father, Martin, that his daughter was dating a new boyfriend, but he does not know the man's name or whereabouts. The autopsy shows blunt trauma and sexual violence and confirms Cory's deduction that the girl died from exposure, specifically pulmonary hemorrhage caused by rapid inhalation of sub-zero air. However, the medical examiner is unable to confirm the death as a homicide, therefore preventing Jane from calling in an additional FBI investigative unit.
Cory discovers that Natalie's boyfriend is Matt Rayburn who works security at a nearby oil drilling site. The next day, Matt's body is discovered, nude and heavily ravaged by scavenging wildlife. Cory tells Jane about his daughter's death three years earlier, whose body was discovered in the snow, following a party while he and his wife were away.
Jane, accompanied by Tribal Police Chief Ben Shoyo and additional officers, visit the drill site where they meet with several of the security guards. They report that Matt stormed off a few days ago following an argument with Natalie and has not been seen since. One guard mentions that they heard about Natalie's body being found by monitoring law enforcement radio channels. Jane points out that Natalie's name was not given out. One of the police officers notices that the security guards are slowly surrounding Jane and her team. The confrontation quickly escalates into an armed standoff as they argue over who has jurisdiction. Jane defuses the situation by asserting federal authority. She asks to see where Matt was bunking, and they resume their approach to the trailer.
A flashback then depicts Natalie in bed with Matt in his trailer. Unexpectedly, his security colleagues barge into the trailer after a night of hard drinking. Pete, a particularly vulgar crew member, taunts them and tries to sexually assault Natalie, which provokes Matt to violence. The guards retaliate by beating Matt down while Pete rapes Natalie. Matt's attempt to fight back gives Natalie an opportunity to escape, but the group bludgeon him to death.
Back in the present, Cory has retraced the tracks from where Matt's corpse was found back to the drilling camp. Meanwhile, Jane and the police approach the drill crew's sleeping quarters. Cory, standing at a distance on a hill above the camp and looking down at the group, radios a warning to Ben but not before Jane, wearing a bullet-proof vest, is hit in the chest by a shotgun blast fired through the door by Pete, wounding her. A firefight ensues, in which Ben and the other officers are killed. As the surviving security guards prepare to execute Jane, Cory picks them off with his rifle, except for Pete, who, though wounded, flees on foot. Cory catches Pete and takes him up a mountain top. After forcing Pete's confession, Cory offers him the same chance Natalie had: a barefooted escape toward a distant road wearing light-weight clothing. Pete runs through the snow but quickly succumbs as his lungs give out from the same pulmonary hemorrhage that killed Natalie.
Cory visits Jane in the hospital and praises her toughness. He later visits Martin, finding him sitting outside his house wearing his ""death face"" paint. Cory tells Martin that the case is closed and that the man responsible for Natalie's death went out, ""with a whimper."" They share grief over their daughters' deaths.
A title card states that missing-persons statistics are kept for every demographic group, except for Native American women, whose numbers remain unknown."
T2 Trainspotting,"Twenty years after stealing £16,000 in drug money from his three friends and making a new life in Amsterdam, 46-year old Mark Renton returns home to Edinburgh after having a heart attack in a gym. While he has been clean from heroin for 20 years, his life has not otherwise improved; his marriage has failed and he is about to lose his job. Daniel ""Spud"" Murphy has returned to heroin addiction after having lost everything including his wife, Gail, and visitation with his teenage son, Fergus, whom he fathered shortly after Renton left. Simon ""Sick Boy"" Williamson now abuses cocaine, runs a failing pub, and engages in blackmail and filming schemes with his Bulgarian girlfriend, Veronika. Meanwhile, Francis ""Franco"" Begbie is serving a 25-year prison sentence after being arrested for the drug deal in '96 and a robbery, and viciously assaults his lawyer after being denied parole.
Renton, who has rented a hotel room, stops by his childhood home, where his father tells him about his mother's death, and they reconcile. He goes to Spud's apartment just in time to save him from a suicide attempt. Spud initially resents the intervention, but Renton offers to help him out of his addiction. Renton visits Simon at the pub, where Simon attacks him. Afterward, Renton meets Veronika and pays Simon back his original share of the money. Simon informs Veronika that he is going to string Renton along and make him pay for his betrayal.
Meanwhile, Begbie has an inmate stab him in order to land him in the hospital. He assaults a doctor and takes his clothing in order to escape. He visits his former girlfriend and meets his college-bound son, Frank Jr. Staying in the apartment, he resorts to a lucrative burglary scheme into which he drags Frank Jr., selling the merchandise to a local fence, Mikey Forrester. Begbie also visits Simon in his pub, where Simon promises to provide him with a false passport to Amsterdam in order to exact his revenge on Renton.
Renton, Simon, and Veronika become partners in crime, robbing a Protestant social club and using the proceeds to renovate the upper floor of Simon's pub into a brothel. They fraudulently apply for an EU business-development grant. Veronika and Renton begin an affair, while Spud also joins in the renovation, befriends Veronika, and takes pleasure in renovating the pub. Inspired by Veronika, he decides to write his memoirs. One of Simon's blackmail targets reports him to the police, and Renton seeks legal advice from his former girlfriend, Diane, now a high-priced solicitor. The proceeds of their crimes are used up in legal fees and Simon's cocaine habit.
One night, Renton and Simon decide to go to a nightclub and snort cocaine while listening to Queen. Incidentally, Begbie, who was hanging out at his fence's place, takes a large dose of speed and Viagra and decides to go out. By chance, Begbie and Renton end up in adjoining bathroom stalls of the nightclub, and they recognise their voices while inside. Renton flees to a parking garage, where he is able to escape from Begbie, but not before Begbie slashes his arm with a knife.
Doyle, the owner of a rival brothel, intimidates Renton and Simon into abandoning their business (and forces them to walk home to Edinburgh naked), but then they receive the £100,000 grant.
Veronika, tired of Simon and Renton's petty schemes, visits Spud and asks him to leave with her, promising him half of the £100,000. He says he will only buy heroin, so she offers to give his share to Gail and Fergus. He helps her steal the money by forging Renton's and Simon's signatures. Later on, Begbie visits the terrified Spud, reading his memoirs and mocking his continuous addiction. Veronika arrives and Begbie intimidates her, but lets them go in exchange for Veronika's phone, which he uses to text Renton to have him come to the pub at midnight. Begbie visits his girlfriend's place for the last time, apologising to Frank Jr. for his behaviour and telling him to be a better man than he is, before departing.
At the pub, Spud arrives too late to warn Renton and Simon of Begbie's trap. Begbie knocks Simon down and chases Renton across the pub. Begbie throws him through the floor, and Renton's neck gets caught in electrical wiring that begins to slowly strangle him. Begbie tries to pull down Renton to strangle him, but Simon doses him with pepper spray and saves Renton by pulling him over to the floor. Begbie pulls out a sawn-off shotgun and tries to kill them both, but Spud knocks him out with a toilet bowl.
They leave Begbie trapped in the boot of Simon's car, at the door of the prison from which he'd escaped. Veronika returns to Bulgaria, and her young son, leaving Spud half of the money. Spud channels his addiction into his writing, and begins mending his relationship with Gail and Fergus, to whom he left his share of the money. It is implied that Spud writes a book entitled Trainspotting from his writings. Renton and Simon resume their old friendship. Renton moves back into his father’s home and embraces him before going into his bedroom and dancing to a remix of ""Lust for Life""."
God's Own Country,"In Yorkshire, Johnny lives on the family farm with his father, Martin, and grandmother, Deirdre. Due to his father having suffered from a stroke, and his grandmother’s age, much of the day-to-day running of the farm falls to Johnny. In his social time, Johnny engages in binge drinking and furtive sexual encounters with other men to numb the pain of his loneliness. Returning late to the farm after such an encounter with a young male auctioneer, he is berated by his father after a calf dies from a breech birth in his absence.
Gheorghe, a Romanian migrant worker, is hired as extra help for lambing season. He arrives and spends his first night in a caravan that the family has organized as his accommodation. As the ewes have moved away from the main part of the farm, and as part of the farm's boundary wall remains unrepaired by Johnny, it is decided that Johnny and Gheorghe should spend several days camping nearer to the animals. When one of the ewes gives birth to an unconscious runt, Johnny is intrigued when Gheorghe is able to resuscitate and care for it. One morning, after Johnny refers to Gheorghe yet again as a ""gypsy,"" Gheorghe tackles him to the ground and warns Johnny not to speak that way to him again.
The next day, the two men again engage in a fight that turns into rough sex. While Johnny initially does not acknowledge the encounter, the two share cigarettes and a sugar packet[4] for their cup noodles throughout the day, and that night have a tender sexual encounter.
Returning to the farm, Johnny invites Gheorghe to stay with him in the house, but Gheorghe elects to remain in the caravan. When Martin suffers a second stroke, Johnny realizes that the running of the farm is now entirely his responsibility, and asks Gheorghe if he will stay with him. When Gheorghe expresses uncertainty over whether they can stay together and maintain the farm simultaneously, Johnny reacts poorly, over-drinking and engaging in another random sexual encounter. When Gheorghe realises what Johnny has done, he abruptly leaves the farm.
Martin is released from the hospital, but is now fully debilitated. Johnny, desperate to make up with Gheorghe, tells his father that he will stay to run the farm, but that things must be run on his terms. Martin gives his tacit approval to Johnny, who sets off to bring Gheorghe back to the farm. After he finds Gheorghe working in Scotland, the two men reconcile. Gheorghe returns with Johnny; the caravan is taken away, and Gheorghe moves into the house.[5][6]"

Arriving at her flat that night, Tom sees Lucy's brother unconscious and a group of masked thugs coming out of Lucy's room, having raped her and recorded the event. Tom flees and attempts to call the police, but is shot in the head and rendered unconscious.
Tom awakens days later, with his doctor informing him that shrapnel from his phone is embedded in his head. Later that day, Tom begins to hear phone transmissions and can visualize digital signals. Using his new found abilities, Tom pieces together who had attacked Lucy and begins to take them down one by one. Meanwhile, Lucy has become a shut in with Tom her only source of hope as they enjoy a meal together outside for the first time since the incident. After a confrontation, Tom's vengeance grows and he tracks down those who gave the orders to hurt Lucy and raids their leader's home; damaging their electronics and stealing their hidden cache of cocaine which Tom plants on the attackers and tips the police off.

Final Portrait,"In Paris 1964, famed painter Alberto Giacometti bumps into his old friend James Lord, an American critic, and asks him to be a model for his latest portrait in his studio for a couple of days. Flattered by the request, Lord complies and as the days turn into weeks, he realizes his entire life has been wasted by this erratic genius. Jumping between joy and frustration, Lord finally sees logic in Giacometti's artistic but chaotic vision and witnesses the genius complete one of his last masterpieces."
Viceroy's House,"Lord Louis Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville) arrives at Viceroy's House in Delhi in 1947 with his strong-willed wife Edwina (Gillian Anderson) and daughter Pamela. As the final Viceroy of India, he is in charge of overseeing the dissolution of the British Raj and the establishment of an independent Indian nation. Mountbatten attempts to mediate a disagreement between the two major Indian political leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru, who wants India to remain intact as one nation after independence, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who wishes to establish the separate Muslim state of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Mountbatten's newly-arrived valet Jeet (Manish Dayal) encounters the beautiful Alia (Huma Qureshi), whom he had fallen in love with previously. Alia continues to spurn Jeet because he is Hindu and she Muslim; she fears that she will disappoint her invalid father Ali (Om Puri).
With riots erupting across India, the British decide to accelerate the independence process. Mountbatten is intent upon a one-state solution, but with intensifying violence between Muslims and Hindus he reluctantly accepts the Partition of India. He is given only a couple months to carve out a separate state from the existing territory, with the help of an inexperienced English lawyer, Cyril Radcliffe (Simon Callow). Jeet continues to pursue Alia, until it is revealed that she has been betrothed since childhood to another man. The servants at Viceroy's House are forced to choose between staying in India or going to Pakistan.
Mountbatten is enraged to find that his Chief of Staff Lord Ismay (Michael Gambon), has been working covertly to draw the boundaries of Pakistan in order to create a buffer state between the Indian subcontinent and the Soviet Union. He realizes that he has been used as a pawn and the displacement of millions of people will result. Jeet is devastated to learn meanwhile that his entire family has been slaughtered in Punjab. Although Alia rejects her fiancé when he returns to claim her, she chooses to depart for Pakistan with her father. Days later Jeet reads in the newspaper that the night train she had boarded was attacked and everyone was killed. In anger he brandishes a knife at Mountbatten, before resigning his post.
With Delhi overwhelmed with refugees, the Mountbattens decide to stay on in India to assist where they can. While Jeet volunteers to help with the refugees, Alia is brought in badly injured but alive, the lone survivor of the train attack. She recognizes Jeet and shouts for him, and the two are reunited."
The Party,"Janet, a politician for the opposition party, has just been announced shadow minister for health and is having a small celebratory party at her house. Invited are her friends April, with her estranged German partner Gottfried, a life coach and self-proclaimed spiritual healer, Women's studies professor Martha, with her partner Jinny, a renowned chef, and Janet's colleague and subordinate Marianne with husband Tom, a banker.
Before the party begins and even after the guests arrive, Janet's husband Bill sits in his chair, listening to music, staring vacantly, and drinking wine. All invited guests come, with the exception of Marianne, who Tom says will arrive later. Tom is extremely nervous and immediately locks himself in the bathroom, where he sniffs some cocaine, examines a gun he has brought with him and encourages himself in the mirror.
While the party is running, Janet is exchanging secret phone calls and messages with a lover.
After April, who continually belittles and insults Gottfried, speaks a toast for Janet, Martha and Jinny announce that Jinny is pregnant with three boys. This is immediately followed by Bill announcing that he has just been informed by his doctor that he is terminally ill. Gottfried tells him that modern medicine is not to be believed and that by becoming spiritual, Bill may have a chance of surviving. Bill, a well-known atheist intellectual, seems to waver in his commitment to his beliefs and begins to listen to Gottfried.
Janet says that she will resign from her shadow minister position and will take care of Bill, but he announces that he is leaving her for Marianne, a fact that Tom had also learned earlier this day. After berating Bill, Tom goes into the backyard, where he throws his gun into the dustbin.
While Jinny and Martha are talking about the future and motherhood, Martha patronizes Jinny, who, deeply hurt, tells Martha that she will leave her. This leads Martha to confess to Jinny that she fears what will happen and to plead Jinny to stay with her.
When Janet throws something in the dustbin, she notices the gun Tom had thrown away and takes it with her, locking herself in the bathroom and hiding the gun there. She lets April in and they talk about what happened. April, who has been cynical the whole time, is asked to speak honestly by Janet and tells her that she is proud of her accomplishments.
Gottfried tries to help and coach Tom and Bill, but their discussions escalate when Bill gushes about the love that Marianne and he share. This leads Tom to punch him in the face, knocking him out cold. Gottfried and Tom fear that Tom has killed Bill and they try to seek help from the others. They fetch Janet from the bathroom, just when she was starting to tell April a secret. Janet manages to resuscitate Bill, who looks her in the eyes and asks ""how did it come to this?"" At that moment, the doorbell rings, with everybody expecting it to be Marianne. Janet rushes to the bathroom, grabs the gun, runs to open the door, aims the gun at the visitor, who is invisible to the audience, and exclaims ""You told me you loved me. ME! You traitor!"" before it cuts to black."
Don't Take Me Home,"The film recounts the saga of Wales national football team to qualify for their first major tournament in 58 years, the UEFA Euro 2016. To get there they had to overcome huge obstacles including the suicide of their young and talented coach, Gary Speed."
The Zookeeper's Wife,"Dr. Jan Żabiński (Johan Heldenbergh) and his wife, Antonina (Jessica Chastain), are the keepers of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest and most prolific zoos in 1930s Europe. In the calm of August 1939, Antonina rides her bicycle through the beautiful zoo grounds, greeting a hippo, horses, bison, and followed faithfully by Adam, a baby camel. She opens the zoo gates with Jerzyk (Michael McElhatton), another zookeeper. A crowd has already gathered to view the many species on display. Jan is the director of the zoo and faces the scornful, yet envious advances of a colleague, Dr. Lutz Heck (Daniel Brühl), the head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist.
On September 1, 1939, Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) are shocked witnesses to the aerial bombardment of Warsaw as German forces storm Poland. The zoo is not spared; bombs raze the cages and kill many of the animals. Lions, tigers, monkeys and kangaroo take to the streets. As Polish resistance collapses under overwhelming odds, Heck arrives at the zoo, convincing Antonina to let him save her prize animals as a ""loan."" He promises to return them to Warsaw when the war ends, which he believes will be soon. With the onset of winter, Heck returns with Nazi soldiers, but this time he has come to shoot the remaining animals, which he says will otherwise die in the cold. Something sinister has invaded Heck, revealed in the cold delight he takes in shooting an eagle, then casually telling an aide to have it stuffed. It becomes evident that Heck has begun to keep a subtle, romantic eye on Antonina.
Warsaw becomes the scene of monstrous upheaval. Jewish-owned shops are shuttered, and Jews are herded into the Ghetto. Wearing Star of David armbands, two of the Zabinskis' friends, Maurycy Fraenkel (Iddo Goldberg) and his partner Magda Gross (Efrat Dor), seek a haven, not for themselves but for another friend's notable insect collection. Antonina makes an unusual offer to shelter Magda in an attic closet. Jan and Antonina take stock of what defiance of the Germans would mean, and how dangerous it would be: they can be shot simply for offering a Jew a glass of water. But they come to the realization that, in their zoo, they can save one life. Magda Gross is the first.
With the zoo abandoned, Jan and Antonina seek out Heck at his headquarters in Warsaw. The couple make a daring proposal to turn the zoo into a pig farm. They secretly hope to help Jews by bringing food into the Ghetto, but they tell Heck that, with pigs, they can help feed the German occupying forces. Heck is intrigued; he needs a home for his experiments on recreating ancient beasts as a symbol of the Reich.[Note 2] He agrees to the pig farm idea.
Jan begins retrieving garbage scraps from the Ghetto to feed the pigs; the sights he sees there, of starving Jews, is shocking and unbearable. Jan begins to work with the Underground Army, to spirit Jews from the Ghetto to safehouses in other parts of the country. He sneaks them out in his garbage truck, taking them to the zoo, where they hide in animal cages, tunnels, and inside the Zabinski house. After some trepidation, Antonina agrees to help. It's not easy for her at first, but she has a gift with frightened creatures and learns how to comfort even the most terrified people.
While trying to rescue a group of Jews, Jan discovers a young girl, Urszula (Shira Haas), being raped by two Nazi guards. Jan hides Urszula in his truck and sneaks her into the zoo. She is traumatized and refuses to speak. Antonina slowly draws her out by telling her the story of her own hard childhood, and by giving her a baby rabbit. Urszula eventually loses her fear and becomes part of the secret household of hidden Jews.
The Żabińskis continue to sneak Jews out of the Ghetto, hiding them in the zoo or disguising them as Aryans by bleaching their hair and taking them to safehouses. However, in 1942, the Germans begin deporting Jews to the death camps. Jan is devastated to see young children being put into cattle cars, to be taken to the camps. They reach for his hand, leaving him no choice but to help them into a cattle car, beneath the eyes of German police.
In 1943, two women rescued by Jan and disguised as Aryans by Antonina are arrested and executed in a Warsaw street. Several months later, after a failed uprising, the Germans announce their intention to liquidate the Ghetto. It will happen on Hitler's birthday, which also falls on the first night of Passover. While the Jews mournfully celebrate a secret Passover Seder in the zoo, the Germans burn down the Ghetto, killing any remaining Jews inside.
Several months later, Antonina has become pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl, whom Ryszard names Teresa. As Heck's attraction to Antonina deepens, and as she struggles to fend him off while still guarding their secret ""guests,"" Jan participates in the Warsaw uprising, in which he is shot in the neck and captured. Antonina worries and wishes that he will return to reunite with them.
In January 1945, with the Soviet troops forcing the Germans to retreat, the enemies begin to evacuate Warsaw. In a last attempt to find Jan, Antonina asks Heck for help, but he refuses, revealing that he once heard Ryszard say ""Hitler ist kaputt"" and accusing Antonina of resistance activity. Heck attacks Antonina in a rage of sexual aggression. She tells him that she is repulsed by him and he realizes that she never wanted him, that he had been duped by her self-protective flirtatiousness. Antonina returns to the zoo, warning her guests just in time for their escape. Magda takes baby Teresa with her as Antonina hides Ryszard in the basement, knowing Heck will come back. Heck arrives in a fury with his men, barging into the villa's basement and discovering, at last, secret drawings on the walls: yellow Stars of David and dates, and images of hidden Jewish guests drawn with animal faces. In raging retaliation, Heck chases Ryszard through the basement's lion tunnel and outside again, seizing him at gunpoint.
Antonina begs Heck not to kill Ryszard but he drags the boy away. A tense beat; a shot rings out off-screen. Antonina collapses in sobs. And then Ryszard suddenly returns, victim of a cruel hoax. Lutz Heck leaves the zoo for good, and Antonina and Ryszard join the long march out of Warsaw, taking with them the rabbit and one of Heck's test subjects, a young bison. As they leave their home and the city is liberated, they release the bison into the woods.
Four months after the Nazi surrender, Warsaw begins to be rebuilt. Antonina, Ryszard and baby Teresa return. The zoo is terribly damaged but still standing. Jerzyk, their loyal zookeeper, is there to greet them. Spring comes as they begin to rebuild, and with them, Urszula, Magda, and Maurycy. As birds return and life resumes, Antonina looks up to see Jan walking home, a survivor of a prison camp. Antonina runs into his arms.
In the film's final moment, the Żabińskis paint Stars of David on all the cages in the zoo.
The Postscript tells us that 300 people were saved by the Zabinskis in their zoo. Lutz Heck returned to Berlin, where his zoo was destroyed by Allied bombings. His efforts to recreate extinct aurochs failed. The Żabińskis were eventually recognized by Yad V'shem for their righteous acts and defiance against the Germans.[9] The Zabinskis rebuilt their zoo and the Warsaw Zoo remains open to this day."
Baby Driver,"Baby is a getaway driver in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was a child, a car accident killed his parents and left him with tinnitus, which he blocks out by listening to music on his iPod. He ferries crews of robbers assembled by Doc, a criminal mastermind, to pay off a debt he incurred after stealing one of Doc's cars. Between jobs, he creates remixes from snippets of conversations he records and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. At a diner, he meets a waitress, Debora, and they start dating.
Baby's next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. While Baby is on a date with Debora, Doc insists he join a heist at a post office, threatening to hurt Debora and Joseph if he refuses.
The crew consists of easy-going Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and trigger-happy Bats, who takes an immediate dislike to Baby. While the crew attempts to purchase illegal arms for the job, Bats recognizes one of the dealers as a policeman and opens fire. They kill all of the dealers. Afterward, Bats makes Baby stop at Debora's diner, unaware of Baby and Debora's romance. Baby, aware of Bats' homicidal habit, stops him from killing her to avoid paying.
Doc is furious, revealing that the dealers were dirty cops on his payroll. He decides to cancel the heist, but Bats, Buddy and Darling disagree. Doc lets Baby decide; he chooses to go through with it. Baby attempts to slip away late that night, hoping to take Debora and leave Atlanta. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is an informant; when they and Doc hear his mixtapes, they are convinced of his innocence.
During the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive away, causing Bats to hit him. Baby then rams the car into a rebar which impales Bats, killing him. The three flee on foot. After the police kill Darling in a shootout, Buddy blames Baby for her death and vows to kill him. Baby steals a car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home, Baby drives to Debora's diner to pick her up, where an armed Buddy is waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as the police close in.
Baby seeks help from Doc, who initially refuses to help. After seeing he truly loves Debora, Doc supplies them with cash and directions to get out of the country, stating that he was in love once. The police confront the three in the parking garage, but Doc kills them all. Buddy then ambushes them with a stolen police car and hits and kills Doc. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy. He shoots next to both Baby's ears, deafening him. Debora disarms Buddy with a crowbar and Baby shoots him in the leg, causing him to fall to his death.
Fleeing Atlanta, Baby and Debora run into a police roadblock. Baby surrenders, telling Debora she does not belong in the world of crime. At Baby's trial, Joseph, Debora, and several people Baby saved/helped during the robberies testify for him. Baby is sentenced to 25 years in prison, with a parole hearing after five. He receives postcards from Debora, who promises to wait for him. When Baby is eventually released, he finds Debora waiting for him."

Unlocked,"After an operation in Paris failed on her watch, CIA interrogation officer Alice Racine now works in an undercover capacity at a community centre in London. The area is a hotspot for Islamic extremism, and information she discovers in her capacity at the centre is passed on to the security services, including MI5 Intelligence Chief Emily Knowles. Her former station chief and mentor Eric Lasch meets with her, and tells her that she shouldn’t feel guilty for the failed operation (which resulted in Algerian suicide bombers killing 24 people) and that she needs to get back into the field. Meanwhile, the Central Intelligence Agency and MI5 receive intel that radical preacher Imam Yazid Khaleel is planning a biological attack on an American target on British soil in collaboration with terrorist and American born Islamic convert David Mercer. Racine is approached by Frank Sutter, an officer from the CIA’s London Station, who tells her she has orders from Europe Division Chief Bob Hunter to help them interrogate and break Khaleel’s courier they have captured.
In a hotel, Racine begins to interrogate the courier, a British-Moroccan man named Lateef, and is able to coax the message he is due to deliver to Mercer’s representative to confirm the attack. However, before divulging the details of the message to Sutter, she receives a call from her handler Ed Romley, who confusingly gives her the same mission brief as Sutter. Realising she has been tricked and the men she is working with are not CIA, she attempts to remove Lateef from their custody, but in an ensuing gunfight he is killed. She retreats to Lasch's apartment, but that is soon also attacked by the operatives, with Racine witnessing Lasch be fatally shot as she escapes to a safe house he informed her of previously. Upon arriving at the safe house, she apprehends burglar Jack Alcott, who is in the process of robbing the apartment. Restraining him in the bedroom, she contacts Hunter and Romley, who despite claiming to believe her, per protocol, send SCO19 officers to apprehend and bring her in. After fighting two of the officers and being tasered, she is saved by Alcott and the two manage to escape. Revealing he is a former Royal Marine who served in the Iraq War, Racine reluctantly decides to allow him to accompany her. Racine also seeks the help of Amjad, a friend and client from the community centre who drives a taxi.
She and Alcott confront Khaleel in a Moroccan restaurant, where he confesses he no longer believes in the radical extremism he promotes (with the courier message being a stand down order), but anticipates that Mercer will still go ahead with the attack. Following an associate of Lateef, Racine discovers Alcott is working with Sutter and the two fight, with Racine managing to escape after Alcott is killed by an aggrieved third party. Racine approaches Knowles, who agrees to help her and sets up an operation where Amjad stands in as the courier to meet with Mercer's representative. She reveals to Racine that intelligence from the French DGSI suggests senior parties in the CIA allowed the Paris attack to take place, as one of the victims killed in the bombings was a CIA whistle blower. Meanwhile, Romley's team track the bullets used in the killing of their men who apprehended Lateef to a AT308C sniper rifle, which is revealed to have been checked out of a Metropolitan Police armoury by corrupt MI5 operative John Wilson. Wilson is shown to be part of the team providing cover for Knowles operation, and guns down his fellow operatives as well as injuring Knowles whilst trying to kill Racine. Amjad is also killed in the crossfire.
Having survived the attack, Racine heads to a meeting point organised by Sutter, where it is revealed that Lasch is not only alive but is the main conspirator. After a brief struggle, he escapes, but is tracked by her to a warehouse outside of Wembley Stadium, where a sold out game of American football is due to be played between Portland and Oklahoma. Lasch reveals he wants the biological attack to take place, and the visiting Americans to transport the virus back home, in order to force the US Government to take the threat of biological warfare seriously. After shooting Wilson, Racine and Lasch engage in a brief fight, which ultimately results in him falling to his death and Racine disarming the virus canisters. Knowing that in light of the attack failing Mercer will attempt to flee to Syria, she is instructed by Hunter to intercept him en route. In Prague, Mercer is about to meet with a contact who will take him on the next leg of his journey, but is accosted by Racine at a tram station where she slices his femoral artery, killing him."
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword,"Mordred, an iron-fisted warlock, and his armies lay siege to Camelot, seeking to establish the dominance of magic-wielding mages over humankind. Uther Pendragon, king of the Britons, infiltrates Mordred's lair and beheads him, saving Camelot. Uther's treacherous younger brother Vortigern, who covets the throne, orchestrates a coup and sacrifices his wife Elsa to moat hags to become a demon knight, who kills Uther's wife and slays him in combat. The only survivor is Uther's son, who drifts away in a boat and ends up in Londinium, where he is found and raised by prostitutes.
Arthur grows into a skilled fighter and man of the streets. Arthur and his friends confront a group of Vikings who had mistreated one of the prostitutes, forcing him to pay her restitution. Afterwards, the brothel is raided by the Blacklegs, Vortigern's minions, and Arthur learns that the Vikings were under the king's protection. Arthur tries to escape the city but is caught and put on a ship with hundreds of other men; the Blacklegs have been forcing all men of Arthur's age to try to pull a sword that has appeared near the castle from the surrounding stone. Arthur is able to remove the sword but is quickly overwhelmed by its power and passes out. Vortigern meets with him in the dungeon, revealing his true lineage.
Meanwhile, a mage identifying herself as an acolyte of Merlin presents herself to Uther's former general, Sir Bedivere. At Arthur's planned execution, the mage uses her magic to stage a diversion while Bedivere's men rescue Arthur. Taken to Bedivere's hideout, Arthur initially refuses to help them. The mage persuades Bedivere to take Arthur to a realm called the ""Darklands,"" where he's given a vision of how Uther sacrificed himself to save Arthur and entomb the sword in stone. Arthur learns Vortigern was responsible for persuading Mordred to rebel against humanity, and he returns determined to destroy Vortigern.
With his friends and Bedivere's men, Arthur stages a series of ambushes against Vortigern, culminating in an assassination attempt in Londinium. The rebels sense a trap but attack anyway, fleeing to a fighters' school run by Arthur's mentor George, where they are overrun by the Blacklegs. Seeing the mage held at knifepoint, Arthur unleashes Excalibur's potential, single-handedly killing all of the soldiers. The rebels are able to escape the city except for Arthur's injured friend Back Lack, who is killed at Vortigern's hand in front of his son Blue.
Ashamed of his failures, Arthur tries to throw away the sword, but the Lady of the Lake returns it and shows him a vision of England's future under Vortigern's rule. Coming to terms with his responsibility, Arthur reunites with Bedivere. When they return to the rebel hideout, however, they discover all of their allies dead, Vortigern having found them and delivered an ultimatum: if Arthur does not surrender himself, the captured mage and Blue will die. Arthur surrenders himself, but as Vortigern is about to execute his nephew, a giant snake summoned by the mage attacks and devours Vortigern's men. While Bedivere and the others lead an attack on the castle, a desperate Vortigern sacrifices his only daughter and is transformed into the demon knight, confronting Arthur in a separate dimension. Despite his fighting skill, Arthur is beaten, and he is about to submit when he witnesses a vision of his father, convincing him to accept the sword and his character as his own. Arthur violently slays Vortigern but blesses him as he dies.
In the aftermath, Arthur dissolves Vortigern's pact with the Vikings and begins building a Round Table where his knighted friends will meet. Blue and the prostitutes arrive with the crown of Uther, which Arthur accepts, holding the sword aloft."
The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"Steven Murphy, a skilled cardiothoracic surgeon, finishes an open heart surgery, and later goes to a diner where he meets a teenage boy named Martin. The precise nature of their relationship is unexplained. Afterward, Steven returns home to his wife, Anna, and their children, Kim and Bob. The next day, Steven reveals his connection to Martin, claiming he is a schoolmate of Kim's, when Martin unexpectedly comes to speak with Steven at the hospital. Steven later privately tells Anna that Martin's father died in a car accident ten years earlier, and that he has taken an interest in the boy to help him grieve. At Steven's suggestion, Martin comes to the Murphy household for dinner; Kim seems particularly taken with him.
Martin returns the favor by inviting Steven to his mother's home for dinner. After the meal, Steven attempts to leave, but Martin insists he stay and watch a movie with them. Martin leaves halfway through the film, and his mother makes a romantic advance on Steven, who quickly rebuffs her and goes home. Over the next few days, Martin's demands on Steven's time grow increasingly frequent and desperate, but Steven does not reply. One morning Bob awakens and finds he cannot feel his legs—he has become paralyzed. Steven and Anna rush him to the hospital, where a full neurological examination reveals that nothing is physically wrong. Though he briefly recovers, Bob quickly returns to being unable to walk. While the elder Murphys tend to Bob, Kim meets with Martin for a date.
The next morning, Martin visits Bob in the hospital and demands that Steven speak to him in private. The two retreat to the cafeteria, where Martin reveals the truth: his father did not die immediately, as Steven told his wife, but during surgery that Steven himself performed after the crash. Steven failed to save Martin's father, and the boy bluntly tells Steven that he blames the surgeon for the death. He further explains that, to ""balance"" the act of destroying a family, Steven must kill one of the members of his own. Martin goes on to explain that he has placed a curse upon the Murphys that will gradually kill them through a series of stages unless Steven makes his choice and murders one of them; the paralysis is the first of these four stages. Steven attempts to dismiss these seemingly wild claims, but later finds that Bob is refusing food—this is the second stage of Martin's curse. Kim later loses the use of her legs during a choir practice and also will not eat.
Kim receives a phone call from Martin at the hospital. During the conversation, Kim abruptly regains the use of her legs, only to lose mobility again when the connection is broken. This seems to convince Anna of Martin's power, and she travels to his home to directly ask why she and her children must suffer for Steven's mistakes. The unrepentant Martin cannot answer, simply remarking that ""it's the only thing I can think of that's close to justice"". Anna, further suspecting that her formerly alcoholic husband may have imbibed on the day of the operation, speaks to Steven's anesthesiologist, who reveals that Steven did in fact have a few drinks that morning, with Anna sexually gratifying him as payment for the information. At Anna's insistence, the children are transported to their home, where they are continually fed through a nasogastric tube. Anna and Steven fight over the situation, with Steven refusing to believe that anything supernatural is happening. That night, he kidnaps Martin and binds him to a chair in the basement, brutally beating him and demanding that he undo his hold on the children. Martin remains unflappable, warning Steven that time is running out.
Martin's presence only exacerbates the tension in the household: Kim and Bob argue with each other over who their father will choose; Steven tries to gather information to make the decision; and Anna claims that killing one of the children is clearly the only option, as they can have another. Kim attempts to save herself by traveling to the basement to see Martin, demanding that he free her again so that they may run away together. Her strategy fails and she tries to escape herself by crawling through the neighborhood. Steven and Anna save her. The next morning, Anna releases Martin while Steven sleeps, pointing out that holding him captive was of no use. Later that day, Bob begins bleeding from the eyes—the final stage of the curse before death. Rather than choose, Steven binds Kim, Bob, and Anna to chairs in the living room, covers their heads, and pulls a black woolen hat over his own face. He next loads a rifle, spins uncontrollably, and fires. The first two shots miss, but the third pierces Bob's throat and kills him.
Some time later, the family visits the same diner where Steven previously met with Martin. As they sit in silence, Martin enters and stares at them; he and the family briefly lock eyes and Kim begins eating before they stand and leave. Martin gazes after them as they walk through the door."
A Prayer Before Dawn,"Billy Moore (Joe Cole) is sent to prison in Thailand, where he fights tournaments to earn his freedom."
I Am Not a Witch,"In Zambia, an 8-years old girl is sent to a witches' camp after a banal incident at her local village."
You Were Never Really Here,"Joe, a combat veteran and former FBI agent with post-traumatic stress disorder, is a hired gun who rescues trafficked girls, using brutal methods against those responsible. He cares for his elderly mother in his childhood home in New York City. Joe has graphic flashbacks to his childhood and past in the military and FBI.
While returning home from a job, Joe is spotted by the son of Angel, the middleman between Joe and McCleary, his handler. Joe meets with McCleary, and expresses his concerns about his safety potentially being compromised due to Angel's son being aware of his address. McCleary then informs Joe of his next job: a New York State Senator, Albert Votto, has offered a large sum of money to discreetly find and rescue his abducted daughter, Nina.
Accepting the job, Joe stakes out a brothel for wealthy patrons, the address of which was received by Votto in an anonymous text message. He violently kills several security guards and patrons while recovering Nina. While waiting at a motel to return Nina to Votto, Joe sees local news reports that Votto has apparently committed suicide. Corrupt police officers then storm the motel room and take Nina. Joe overpowers an officer who is guarding him and escapes.
Joe finds that McCleary, Angel, and Angel's son have all been killed in search of his home address. Sneaking into his family home, Joe discovers that two corrupt federal agents have murdered his mother and are waiting for him. He ambushes them, killing one and mortally wounding the other. The wounded killer reveals that the whole conspiracy was orchestrated by Governor Williams, and that Nina was ""his favorite.""
Distraught and suicidal, Joe gives his mother a water burial. He attempts to drown himself by loading his clothes with heavy stones, but a vision of Nina convinces him to save the girl. Joe attempts to piece together the conspiracy. He concludes that Votto sold Nina into prostitution to gain favor with Governor Williams and other elites, and later felt extreme guilt after receiving the anonymous text; Votto hired Joe since he knew that the police force was corrupt and under Williams's control.
After following Williams back to his country house, Joe fights his way in only to discover that Williams's throat has been slit. Joe wanders the mansion, distressed and hallucinating, before finding Nina in the kitchen with a bloody straight razor. They are relieved to see each other and leave the mansion.
Later, Joe and Nina are in a diner, sitting silently. Joe collapses out of exhaustion and stress while having a violent suicidal fantasy. Nina wakes Joe, telling him, ""It's a beautiful day.” Joe agrees and they leave together."
My Cousin Rachel,"After the young boy Philip is orphaned, he is adopted by his older cousin Ambrose, who raises him as a son on his large estate in Cornwall. Despite societal beliefs of the necessity of motherhood, Philip grows up with a nearly complete absence of women in the household, before Ambrose leaves the estate for the sunnier climate of Florence. A young man, Philip is left with his godfather Nick Kendall, and learns through correspondence that Ambrose has met his widowed cousin Rachel in Florence, and they have wed. The Kendalls express surprise that Ambrose has become interested in women, though Philip found the absence of female companionship natural. Later, Ambrose begins sending letters indicating distrust of the medical care he is receiving in Florence. Concerned, Philip travels to Italy, only to be informed Ambrose has died and Rachel has left. Though Ambrose's will left the entire estate to Philip pending his next birthday, Philip is convinced Rachel is guilty of murder and threatens her friend Rinaldi with revenge.
Philip returns to Cornwall, and later learns Rachel has followed. She arrives at the estate, and while he vows to confront her, he meets her in the boudoir and is infatuated by the older woman's beauty as they share tea. They accompany each other on riding excursions, and no longer suspecting her of foul play, he throws an accusatory letter on a campfire. The two cousins conflict over Rachel's intentions to return to Florence and live independently, but Rachel indicates she is not angry with him, and they kiss. Rachel also reveals Ambrose had lost hope for her after a miscarriage. She stays for Christmas celebrations, when Nick receives bank information that she has drastically overdrawn her accounts. Nick warns Philip that Rachel was notorious in Florence for extravagance and lust. Despite this, Philip intends to turn over much of the estate's wealth to Rachel, as soon as he can legally dispose of it on his next birthday. The day arrives, and when Rachel realizes what he has done for her, she expresses gratitude. While out in nature, the two have sex. At a dinner with friends, Philip declares he and Rachel are engaged, but Rachel accuses him of madness. In private, she tells him she was merely thankful to him, but she was not bought and is not ashamed of having sex. This leads to a struggle, after which Rachel professes fear of him.
Sometime after, Philip falls ill. As he recovers, he is suspicious of Rachel, and watches her as she leaves on horseback. He and Nick's daughter Louise begin searching through Rachel's belongings for any incriminating evidence, only to find out she apparently is innocent of an affair and the poisoning attempts Philip blames on her. When he sets out in search of Rachel, he finds she has had a fatal accident while riding, on a cliffside. Years later, Philip, by then married to Louise and a father of two, is still, mentally and physically, tormented by Rachel's memory."
47 Meters Down,"Lisa (Mandy Moore) and Kate (Claire Holt) are sisters on holiday in Mexico. Lisa's boyfriend broke up with her because ""she made the relationship boring"". Kate tries to cheer Lisa up and takes her out drinking and dancing at 1:00 am. The sisters meet a pair of local men at a bar and they convince them to go out with them on their boat to watch sharks from a diving cage. Lisa hesitates but Kate persuades her saying it would show Lisa's boyfriend that she isn't boring and make him regret breaking up with her.
The sisters arrive at the boat dock. At first sight, the boat is lackluster and Lisa is immediately wary of it and its owner, Captain Taylor. Upon meeting the girls, the captain asks if the sisters are experienced divers. Kate is a certified diver but Lisa is new to diving, so they lie and say they are both experienced. The dive cage is old and rusty and hangs from a thin chains from an old crane, adding further to Lisa's apprehensions.
As they reach the diving spot, Captain Taylor baits the sharks. Lisa is skeptical about the entire dive, but Captain Taylor dismisses her concerns. The locals dive first in the cage. Unbeknownst to everyone on the boat, the cable supporting the cage starts to fray. The men return to the surface and Captain Taylor prepares to send Lisa and Kate down. When Lisa and Kate are in the cage, the cable breaks and the cage sinks to the bottom, some 47 meters below the surface and out of communication range with the boat. Kate swims up seven meters to resume communications with Captain Taylor, who tells her Javier (Chris J. Johnson) will be coming down with a spare winch to pull them up. He also advises them to stay in the cage as the sharks are circling. Both women are quickly running out of air, but they wait in the cage until they see a torch in the distance. Thinking that Javier cannot see them, Lisa swims out to get him, as Kate's air is lower due to the previous swim. Lisa swims towards the light, close to the bottom to avoid shark attacks from the below. A shark tries to attack Lisa but she swims into a small grotto to avoid it. Continuing to go towards the light, she comes to a crevasse with no bottom in sight.
Swimming over the cliff towards the light she finds the torch but not Javier. While looking around, she gets confused about her distance from the cage and Kate. Just as Javier appears and attempts to usher her back towards safety, he is attacked and killed by a shark. Lisa takes Javier's spear gun and the spare winch, and swims back towards the cage. With the newly acquired torch as well as the spear gun, Lisa swims up and notifies Taylor to pull them up. Disaster strikes as they are being winched to safety: The replacement winch line also snaps and the cage sinks back to the bottom. The cage lands on Lisa's leg, pinning her down. Lisa and Kate panic as they realize they are now both out of options and air.
Kate swims back up to communication range to tell Taylor they are low on air and that Lisa is pinned down. Taylor sends some air tanks down and tells them the Mexican coast guard is an hour out. He also warns her that the second tank may cause nitrogen narcosis which can lead to hallucinations. Kate finds the air tanks just as her original tank runs empty. She also finds three flares to signal the coast guard.
As she returns to the cage, Kate is attacked and dragged away by a shark. Lisa, still pinned and running low on air, uses the spear from the spear gun to pull the tank towards her. In the process, the spear cuts her hand. She dons the new tank, and then hears Kate over the radio. Kate is injured and low on air, and her blood is attracting more sharks. Lisa says she will find her, and uses her BCD to lift up the cage, freeing her leg. After Lisa finds Kate, Taylor tells them the coast guard is still some time out and they need to get back in the cage. Lisa adamantly refuses due to the nature of Kate's wounds, and they decide to swim to the surface. As they swim to the surface, they use one of the three flares to scare the sharks. At the 20-meter mark, they are reminded by Taylor they must wait five minutes to decompress and avoid the bends. As the first flare burns out, Kate tries to light the second flare but drops it and it sinks to the bottom. As she lights the third flare she sees 3 sharks close in front of her. The sisters are now surrounded by sharks and must rush to the surface.
Taylor yells for them to drop their gear and make a break for the surface. They swim as fast as they can towards the surface close to the boat. As they cling to a life ring to get to the boat, one of the sharks bites Lisa's leg and pulls her back down into the water. Lisa hits the shark and gouges its eye out and the shark releases her. Captain Taylor and the other men pull Lisa and Kate onto the boat and begin administering first aid. However, as Lisa stares at her hand on the deck of the boat, she realizes she has been hallucinating due to nitrogen narcosis. She realizes she is still at the bottom with her leg pinned by the cage. She laughs and imagines that she is talking to Kate on the boat deck. The coast guard comes to rescue her and carries Lisa to the surface without Kate. Lisa, as she is slowly and cautiously being brought to the surface, comes out of her hallucination, and realizes her sister is not with her. She starts to cry and call out to Kate, who has been dead since the shark attacked and dragged her away."
Loving Vincent,"One year after Vincent van Gogh's suicide, Postman Joseph Roulin asks his son Armand to deliver Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo. Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely weeks earlier Van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.
Père Tanguy, a Montmartre art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to Auvers-sur-Oise and look for Dr. Paul Gachet, who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at the same inn that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress Adeline Ravoux, who was fond of Van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.
Throughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named René Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, was in possession of a gun, and had often drunkenly waved it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates René, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that René was capable of murder.
Dr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow. He admits there was an argument between them – Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of deteriorating Theo's health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, Postman Roulin later receives word from Theo's widow, Johanna, thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of van Gogh's letters to her – signed, ""Your loving Vincent."""

England Is Mine,"Young, introverted Steven Patrick Morrissey is a sullen, dissatisfied, and shy teen growing up in Manchester in the 1970s. Withdrawn and a loner, he goes out to listen to music at night and then submits letters and reviews to local music newspapers. His father wants him to get a job, his mother wants him to follow his passion for writing, and Steven doesn't quite know what he wants to do. His friend artist Linder Sterling inspires him to continue to write lyrics and urges him to start to perform, but she eventually moves to London. Forced to earn a living and fit in with society, Steven's frustrations and setbacks continue to mount. Although he eventually writes some songs with guitarist Billy Duffy until Duffy breaks it off, and he tries his hand at singing and enjoys it, nothing substantially changes in his life, and Steven seems at the end of his rope. At the end of the film, guitarist Johnny Marr (with whom he would go on to form The Smiths) shows up on his doorstep in 1982."
Dunkirk,"In 1940, during the Battle of France, hundreds of thousands of Allied soldiers have retreated to Dunkirk. Tommy, a young British private, is the sole survivor of a German ambush. At the beach, he finds thousands of troops awaiting evacuation and meets Gibson, who is burying a body. After a German dive-bomber attack, they find a wounded man. They rush his stretcher onto a hospital ship, hoping to remain aboard, but are ordered off. The ship is sunk by dive bombers; Tommy helps another soldier by the name of Alex out of the water. They leave at night on a destroyer, but it is sunk by a U-boat. Gibson opens a hatch, freeing Tommy and Alex from the hold, and they get back to the beach.
With only a single, vulnerable mole available for embarking on deep-draft ships, the Royal Navy requisitions civilian vessels that can get to the beach. In Weymouth, a civilian sailor named Dawson and his son Peter set out on his boat Moonstone rather than let the Navy commandeer her. Impulsively, Peter’s teenage friend George joins them. At sea, they rescue a shell-shocked soldier from a wrecked ship. When he realises that Dawson is sailing for Dunkirk, the soldier demands that they turn back and tries to wrest control of the boat; in the struggle, George falls and suffers a head injury that renders him blind. Elsewhere, three Spitfires cross the English Channel, heading towards Dunkirk. After their leader is shot down in a dogfight, one of the pilots, Farrier, assumes command, though his fuel gauge is shattered. They save a minesweeper from a German Heinkel He 111 bomber, but the other surviving Spitfire is hit and ditches. The pilot, Collins, cannot open his canopy to escape his sinking aeroplane, but is rescued by Moonstone.
Tommy, Alex and Gibson join a group of Scottish soldiers and hide inside a trawler that lies beached outside the Allied perimeter, waiting for the rising tide to refloat it. German troops shoot at the boat, and water enters through the bullet holes. Alex, hoping to lighten the boat, accuses Gibson, who has been silent throughout, of being a German spy and demands that he leave. Gibson reveals he is French; he stole the identity of the soldier he buried, hoping to be evacuated with the British. Everyone abandons the fishing boat when it begins to sink. Gibson is unable to get out and drowns. Alex and Tommy swim towards a nearby destroyer, but it is sunk by a bomber. Moonstone manoeuvres to take on those in the water, including Alex and Tommy. Peter discovers that George is dead; when asked by the shell-shocked soldier, he lies that George will be fine. Farrier shoots down the bomber before his fuel runs out. Gliding over the beach, he lands beyond the Allied perimeter. He sets fire to his aeroplane and is taken prisoner. At the beach, Royal Navy Commander Bolton watches the last British soldiers leave. He notes that nearly 300,000 have been evacuated, ten times more than British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had hoped for. He remains to oversee the evacuation of the French.
Arriving back in Weymouth, Dawson is congratulated for having saved so many men. The shell-shocked soldier sees George's body being carried away. Peter goes to the local newspaper; a front-page article later commends George as a hero. Alex and Tommy board a train in Weymouth. Alex expects public hostility as the train approaches Woking, but they receive a hero's welcome instead. Tommy reads out Churchill's address to the nation from a newspaper."
6 Days,"On 30 April 1980, six Iranians led by Salim storm the Iranian Embassy located in 16 Princes Gate, Kensington in London and hold at least 26 hostages. Notable persons have been summoned by the incident, including SAS members led by Lance Corporal Rusty Firmin, BBC Reporter Kate Adie, and Chief Inspector Max Vernon of Metropolitan Police. The authorities receive a call from Salim, demanding the release of 91 Arab prisoners in Iran, or else they will kill a hostage if the demands are not met.
On Day 2, Max negotiates with Salim by phone, saying that Max will help him by means of no violence. After that, Salim releases one hostage, due to illness, but Salim maintains his promise that he will start killing the hostages. After Max brings food to the terrorists, Salim speaks to Max, demanding two buses to Heathrow Airport in two days.
On Day 3 and 4, Salim calls again, demanding that the Ambassador speak with them. Salim's right-hand man, Faisal, takes one hostage to be killed. However, the Iranian authorities refuse to be part of the negotiation. Salim calls Max, demanding to speak to the BBC, and Max reluctantly agrees. A vengeful Salim says that his people are being tortured by the Persians. Afterwards, Salim reluctantly releases another hostage.
On Day 5, as per Salim's demand, the BBC World Service are able to broadcast the message from the terrorists, stating that the reason for arriving in the UK is because of the oppression by the Iranian government in Arabistan. Hearing the news, Salim thanks Max and releases two hostages.
On Day 6, Faisal kills a hostage after the demand of bringing the bus is not met. The shooting prompts the SAS to take action of infiltrating the embassy. Once inside, they manage to release the hostages safely and kill the terrorists including Salim and Faisal."

Sophia agrees, but as soon as the young painter Jan arrives to paint the couple, he and Sophia fall in love. Jan sends a note to Sophia, asking her to send him a vase with tulips. She shows up at his door with the tulips, and they consummate their love.
Meanwhile, Sophia's friend, the housemaid Maria, is having an affair with the neighborhood fishmonger, Willem. Willem is also speculating in the tulip market, and is doing quite well - expecting to be independently prosperous and able to marry Maria, he even sells his business to another fishmonger. One day, Sophia borrows Maria's cloak and heads to a rendezvous with her adulterous lover. Willem, seeing Sophia in the cloak, mistakes her for Maria, and follows her to her rendezvous. Crushed by what he thinks is Maria's unfaithfulness, he goes to a pub to drown his sorrows. There a prostitute robs him of the large sum he has built up on the tulip market. When he tries to retrieve the money, he is beaten up and forcibly inducted into the navy for causing a ruckus.
Jan plots to escape to the new world - with Sophia, if possible - after having success of his own in the tulip speculation market. He hears that the nuns at St. Ursula (the convent Sophia came from) raise tulips in their gardens. Jan attempts to steal some of the bulbs, but is knocked out by the abbess of St. Ursula. When he regains consciousness, he apologises and the abbess gives him the bulbs Willem had bought before he was thrown into the navy.
Maria realises she is pregnant by Willem, which is diastrous for her; with Willem gone, the baby will be born out of wedlock. Sophia conspires with Maria: she will pretend to be pregnant instead, and when the baby is born, Sophia will pretend to die in childbirth, so she can leave to be with Jan, and Maria will stay with the baby to raise it herself.
When Maria finally gives birth to a daughter and Sophia pretends to die, Cornelis is griefstricken at the loss of his wife. Sophia, under her shroud pretending death, weeps as she now understands that Cornelis cared for her. While she is being carried away in a coffin, she regrets what she has done. When she later returns to the home, she catches sight of Cornelis lovingly cradling the baby, and senses that perhaps it's too late to set things right. She flees back to the convent where she was raised.
Jan has one last transaction that will get him enough money to let him and Sophia leave the city and also pay off all his creditors. He tasks his fool of a friend Gerrit with accomplishing this transaction, charging him not to get drunk along the way. Gerrit completes the transaction and then does get drunk. In the ensuing revelry he eats the cargo he was carrying. When he tells Jan and Jan's creditors how he ate the ""onion,"" they all know they have been ruined. The tulip bubble has burst. Jan goes to find Sophia, but finds her bright blue silk cloak in the river instead, which she cast off while fleeing back to the convent. He thinks she has flung herself into the canal as a result of the crashed tulip market.
Willem, returning after his year in the navy, goes to see Maria at Cornelis's house. Maria is furious with him when he explains that he was in Africa, but they sort out their misunderstandings and reconcile. Cornelis, in the next room, overhears their loud quarreling and the reveal of the conspiracy. He makes his peace with the truth, and departs for the Indies, but only after first leaving the house to Maria, Willem, and the baby girl he loved as his own.
Some eight years later, Jan has nothing left except the paintings of his lover Sophia. The abbess of St. Ursula praises him for his talent, and gives him work repainting a mural in the church. When Jan arrives at the abbey, he sees Sophia as a nun and is pleased and smiles. The movie ends with the maid Maria and her fishmonger husband Willem eating dinner with their children. The golden rays of the sun are shining through the once gray house, and all ends happily."
Darkest Hour,"In May 1940, the opposition Labour Party in Parliament demands the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain for being too weak in the face of the Nazi onslaught. Chamberlain tells Conservative Party advisers that he wants Lord Halifax as his successor, but Halifax does not want to become Prime Minister yet. Chamberlain must choose the only other man whom other parties will support: Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty.
Churchill tries to dismiss his new secretary Elizabeth Layton for mis-hearing him, which earns him a rebuke from his wife Clementine. King George VI reluctantly invites Churchill to form a government including Chamberlain and Halifax.
Although he was right about the danger from Adolf Hitler, Churchill has a poor reputation because of his record in the Admiralty, the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War, his views on India and his support for Edward VIII during the Abdication Crisis. Parliament reacts coolly to Churchill's first speech promising ""Blood, toil, tears and sweat,"" for which he is chastised by the King. Churchill refuses to negotiate for peace, believing that the Germans are untrustworthy, but the French Prime Minister thinks him delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the Battle of France. Halifax and Chamberlain agree, keen to use Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Bastianini as intermediary to negotiate with Germany. They plan to resign from the government if Churchill refuses, to cause a vote of no confidence that will allow Halifax to become Prime Minister.
The British Expeditionary Force is trapped at Dunkirk and Calais. Against the advice of the War Cabinet, Churchill orders Brigadier Claude Nicholson in Calais to lead the 30th Infantry Brigade in a suicide attack to distract the enemy while the soldiers at Dunkirk evacuate.
Defeat in France causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with Germany. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill; the King, not wanting to rule in exile should Britain be invaded, encourages the Prime Minister to continue the war. Still uncertain of what to do, Churchill decides to ask London Underground passengers; the civilians want to continue to fight. Churchill meets with the Outer Cabinet[11] and other members of Parliament, who also support him. The evacuation of troops from Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo, is successful.
As Churchill prepares to address Parliament, Halifax asks Chamberlain to continue with their plan to resign, but Chamberlain decides to listen to the address first. Towards the end of his speech, Churchill proclaims that ""We shall fight on the beaches"" should the Germans invade. Chamberlain decides to support Churchill, and Parliament applauds the Prime Minister's defiance."
Lean on Pete,"Charley, a teen living with his single father, finds work caring for an aging racehorse named Lean On Pete. When he learns Pete is bound for slaughter, the two embark on an odyssey across the new American frontier in search of a place to call home."
Battle of the Sexes,"The film dramatizes the events leading up to the 1973 match between Billie Jean King (Emma Stone) and Robert Larimore Riggs (Steve Carell), and their personal lives. King and Gladys Heldman (Sarah Silverman) confront Jack Kramer (Bill Pullman) who has announced a tennis tournament where the top prize for women is one-eighth of the men’s prize, despite equal ticket sales. King and Heldman threaten to start their own tour but Kramer won't alter the terms, citing the inferiority of women’s tennis. He later expels the women who join the new tour from the Lawn Tennis Association. The women's tour struggles until Heldman wins a lucrative sponsorship from Virginia Slims cigarettes. Billie Jean begins an affair with Marilyn Barnett (Andrea Riseborough), her hairdresser, threatening her marriage to Larry King (Austin Stowell).
Meanwhile, Riggs’ marriage to the wealthy Priscilla Wheelan (Elisabeth Shue) is in trouble because of his addiction to gambling. Thrown out of his house when he can’t conceal a Rolls Royce he won in a tennis bet, he hits upon the idea of a challenge match against the top woman player, boasting that even at age 55 he can beat any woman. King declines, but Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee), who recently beat King in a match, accepts. Riggs easily defeats Court and King decides she has to accept his challenge, but demands a final say as to the arrangements. King trains intensely, while Riggs relaxes. King objects to Kramer as a game announcer, threatening to not play unless he withdraws, which he does. After a slow start, King wins the match."
Victoria & Abdul,"Abdul Karim, a young prison clerk from Agra, India, is instructed to travel to England for Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887 to present her with a mohur, a gold coin which has been minted as a token of appreciation from British-ruled India.
The Queen, who is lonely and tired of her fawning courtiers, develops an interest in and later a friendship with Abdul. She spends time with him alone, and promotes him to become her Munshi. She asks him to teach her Urdu and the Qur'an. When Victoria discovers that he is married, she invites his wife and mother-in-law to join him to England. They arrive wearing black Burqas, to the consternation of the household.
While Victoria treats Abdul as a son, his preferment is resented by her household and inner circle, including her son Bertie and the Prime Minister. The household plots to undermine their relationship, hoping that Abdul will be sent home. When Victoria embarrasses herself by recounting to the court the one-sided account of the Indian Mutiny that Abdul had told her, Victoria's faith and trust in him are shaken and she decides he must go home. But the following day she changes her mind and asks him to stay. She gives Abdul a bejewelled locket with her photograph.
Victoria's interest in India grows, and at her Isle of Wight home of Osborne House, she has the Durbar Room built for state functions, elaborately decorated with carvings by Bhai Ram Singh in an intricate style, and with a carpet from Agra. She hangs portraits of Indians in the House. She tells the household that she intends to give Abdul a knighthood.
The Prime Minister is adamant that the royal household must find a way to get rid of Abdul. They research his family background in India, and present Victoria with a dossier to show that his family is more ordinary and poor than Abdul has told her. When Victoria insists her doctor examine Abdul to find out why his wife has not fallen pregnant, he discovers that Abdul has gonorrhea, and rushes to tell the Queen, expecting her to dismiss him in disgust. However, Victoria remains loyal to Abdul and admonishes her courtiers for plotting against him.
Eventually the household decides that, if Victoria does not break with Abdul, they will all resign. They also threaten to certify Victoria as insane. When Victoria is told, she angrily summons the entire household to the Durbar Room and demands that anyone who wants to resign step forward. When none do so, she tells them she has decided not to make Abdul a knight, but to include him in her next honours list as a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.
When Victoria falls ill, she urges Abdul to return to India, while she can still provide him with protection. She warns him that when she dies, the court will turn on him, but Abdul insists that he will stay with Victoria until the end of her life. In 1901, Victoria dies, and her son Bertie, now Edward VII, rejects Abdul, burning all the gifts and papers he has received from the Queen, and sending him and his family back to India. Abdul's wife manages to save the locket for him. It is revealed that Abdul lived in India until his death eight years later in 1909. The film ends with Abdul kneeling at a large statue of the Queen close to the Taj Mahal, talking to it and kissing its feet in respect."
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","In the town of Ebbing, Missouri, Mildred Hayes is grieving the rape and murder of her teenage daughter, Angela, seven months earlier. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, Mildred rents three abandoned billboards near her home, and posts on them: ""Raped While Dying"", ""Still No Arrests?"", and ""How Come, Chief Willoughby?"" The billboards upset the townspeople, including Chief Bill Willoughby and Officer Jason Dixon, the latter being a racist and a violent alcoholic. The open secret that Willoughby suffers from terminal pancreatic cancer adds to everyone's disapproval. Mildred and her son Robbie are harassed and threatened, but to Robbie's chagrin, she stays firm about keeping the billboards up.
While Willoughby is sympathetic to Mildred's frustration, he finds the billboards an unfair attack on his character. Angered by Mildred's lack of respect for his authority, Dixon threatens businessman Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, and he arrests her friend and coworker, Denise, on trivial marijuana possession charges. Mildred is also visited by her abusive ex-husband Charlie, who blames her for their daughter's death.
Willoughby brings Mildred in for questioning after she drills a hole in her dentist's thumb when he threatens her. During the interview, Willoughby coughs up blood. He leaves the hospital against medical advice and spends an idyllic day with his wife Anne and their two daughters, then commits suicide due to his illness. He leaves suicide notes for several people, including Mildred, in which he explains that she was not a factor in his suicide and that he secretly paid to keep the billboards up for another month, amused at the trouble this will bring her and hope that they will keep attention on the murder. Dixon reacts to the news of Willoughby's death by assaulting Welby and throwing him out of a window. This is witnessed by Willoughby's replacement, Abercrombie, who fires Dixon. In the meanwhile, Mildred is threatened by a crop-haired stranger in her store.
The billboards are destroyed by arson. Mildred retaliates by tossing Molotov cocktails at the police station, which she believes is unoccupied for the night. However, Dixon is there to read Willoughby's letter to him, which advises him to let go of hate and learn to love, as the only way to realize his wish to become a detective. Dixon escapes with Angela's case file but suffers severe burns. Mildred's acquaintance James witnesses the incident and provides Mildred with an alibi, claiming they were on a date. Dixon is treated for his burns, and he is temporarily confined in the same hospital room as Welby, to whom he apologizes.
Discharged from the hospital, Dixon overhears the man who threatened Mildred bragging in a bar of an incident similar to Angela's murder. He notes the Idaho license plate number of the man's vehicle, then provokes a fight by scratching the man's face. At home later, he removes a sample of the man's DNA from under his fingernails. Meanwhile, Mildred goes on a date with James to thank him for the alibi. Charlie enters with his 19-year-old girlfriend Penelope and admits to burning the billboards while intoxicated. After accidentally causing James to leave, Mildred tells Charlie to treat Penelope well and leaves.
Though commending him, Abercrombie informs Dixon that the DNA sample does not match DNA found on Angela's body, and that the man was overseas on military duty at the time of the murder. Dixon concludes that the man must be guilty of some other rape, and joins Mildred on a trip to Idaho in order to kill him. On the way, Mildred confesses to Dixon that she set the police station on fire. He indicates that he knew already. They express reservations about their mission but agree to decide what to do along the way."
The Death of Stalin,"Pianist Maria Yudina hides a note in a recording for Joseph Stalin, saying he has ruined the country. As Stalin reads it in his dacha, he is paralysed by a cerebral haemorrhage. The members of the Central Committee are alerted. The first to arrive are NKVD head Lavrentiy Beria, who discovers Maria's note, and Deputy General Secretary Georgy Malenkov. As Malenkov panics, Beria guides him to take leadership, hoping to use him as a puppet.
Moscow Party Head Nikita Khrushchev arrives with the rest of the Committee, except for Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, whom Stalin added to one of his lists of enemies the night previously. Beria closes off Moscow, has the NKVD take over city security duties from the Red Army, and replaces Stalin's enemy lists with his own, reprieving Molotov. Khrushchev and Beria struggle for symbolic victories such as control over Stalin's unstable son Vasily and daughter Svetlana.
When Stalin dies, the Committee members rush back to Moscow as the NKVD loot Stalin's dacha and execute witnesses. Khrushchev goes to Molotov's home and attempts to enlist his support, but Molotov, a true believer in Stalinism, opposes any factionalism within the Party. Beria buys his loyalty by releasing his wife Polina Molotova from confinement.
Malenkov is named as nominal Premier while being largely controlled by Beria. At the first Committee meeting following Stalin's death, Beria sidelines Khrushchev by putting him in charge of Stalin's funeral and suggesting many of the liberal reforms which Khrushchev had planned. Stalin's body is laid in state in the Hall of Columns, while many political prisoners are released and restrictions on the Russian Orthodox Church are loosened, earning Beria more popular support. Field Marshal Georgy Zhukov arrives and demands to know why the Red Army troops have been confined to barracks within Moscow.
Beria learns that Khrushchev has a passing acquaintance with Maria, who was hired to play at the funeral, and threatens them both with the note. Khrushchev approaches Zhukov, who agrees to provide the Army's support in a coup to overthrow Beria, but only if the Committee agrees.
To undermine Beria's popularity, Khrushchev orders the trains into Moscow to resume, allowing thousands of mourners into the city. As he planned, the NKVD guards around the Hall fire on the crowd, killing 1,500 people. The Committee suggests scapegoating low-level NKVD officers; as Beria believes blame attached to security services will tarnish him, he angrily threatens the Committee with incriminating documents he has collected on them. Molotov secretly tells Khrushchev and Kaganovich he will support the coup if they can enlist the support of the others, including Malenkov.
On the day of Stalin's funeral, Khrushchev lies to the Committee and Zhukov that he has Malenkov's support. The Red Army overwhelms the NKVD and takes up positions outside the conference room. Zhukov and his men arrest Beria, and Khrushchev coerces Malenkov into signing the papers for Beria's trial. Khrushchev and his allies find Beria guilty of treason and of sexual assault in a kangaroo court and execute him. As Beria's body is burnt, Khrushchev gives Svetlana a ticket to Vienna and assures her that her brother will be cared for. Several years later, Khrushchev, now Supreme Leader of the Soviet Union after removing his co-conspirators, attends a concert given by Maria, while future leader Leonid Brezhnev watches him."
The Ritual,"Five old friends from university--Phil, Dom, Hutch, Luke, and Rob--meet over drinks at a pub, and discuss plans for a group trip to catch up with one another. Rob suggests hiking in Sweden, but is quickly shot down by the others. Later in the evening, the group exits the pub and passes a shop. Luke wishes to stop and purchase a bottle of Vodka, which Rob accompanies him in doing. While conversing in the shop, the pair notices the distressed cashier slumped against the wall behind the register. Two armed robbers emerge from the back room, and Luke hides behind a shelf at the end of the aisle, leaving Rob frozen in fear. The robbers antagonize Rob, demanding his wallet, watch, and ring. Rob parts with the first two willingly, but refuses to give them his ring, as it is his wedding band. Luke, still hidden from sight, flips the bottle in his hand and prepares to intervene. However, he is too slow to act, and Rob is bludgeoned to death before his eyes.
To honor Rob's wish, the four embark on a hiking trip along Kungsleden, or King's Trail, in Sarek National Park in northern Sweden six months after his death. When Dom loses his footing and injures his knee, impairing his ability to walk, Hutch consults the map and decides that an alternate route through a forest off the trail will take them half the time. Upon entering the forest, the group encounters strange phenomena, including a gutted elk hanging from the tree branches and strange symbols carved on the trees.
As night falls, a torrential rainstorm soaks the men. While looking for shelter, they come upon an abandoned cabin and decide to break in and stay overnight. Inside the cabin, they find necklaces hanging from the walls that depict similar symbols as the runes carved in the tree. While exploring the second floor of the cabin, Phil discovers a strange wooden effigy that is shaped like a decapitated human torso with antlers for hands.
During the night, the four are plagued by nightmares. Upon waking the next morning, Luke finds that he has sustained a set of strange puncture wounds on his chest. The group finds Phil in the attic, naked and kneeling in prayer in front of the effigy.
The group leaves the cabin to continue their travels deeper into the woods, trying to find a way out.
Upon climbing a ridge in order to gain some perspective regarding their location, Luke sees a human-like hand wrapped around the trunk of a distant tree. While trying to discuss his findings with the group, Dom is doubtful of his report. An argument ensues wherein Dom reveals that he blames Luke for Rob's death, and calls Luke cowardly for failing to act during the robbery.
Later that night, Luke is woken from another nightmare by screams. Discovering that Hutch's tent is empty, the three rush deeper into the woods, following Hutch's screams. By dawn, they realize that they have become lost and cannot recall where their campsite was. They decide to continue their search without their tents and supplies. The three come upon Hutch impaled on tree branches, much like the gutted deer they had found earlier. The group retrieves Hutch's body for his compass and knife, and then give him an impromptu burial by covering his body with tree branches.
Luke leaves Phil and Dom on the lower part of a ridge, climbing a hill that provides an overview of the entire forest. He realizes that they are relatively close to the edge of the forest, and also spots smoke rising from distant campfires. He rejoins the two to tell them the news, but finds them with their flashlights pointed towards the trees, saying they heard a noise. Suddenly, Phil is dragged off-screen by an unseen creature. Upon seeking a hiding spot, Luke encounters Dom, and urges him to run with him. They get to their feet and begin to run, the creature giving chase. They pass Phil's body impaled on the branches of a tree near a path of torches that leads to a small village. They seek shelter in the first building they seen, and collapse on the cabin floor, only to be rendered unconscious by its occupants.
When they awaken, they find themselves restrained by their hands in a basement. An elderly woman enters the basement and inspects the puncture marks on Luke's chest. She pulls down her dress to reveal a similar pattern on her chest. She turns to leave the basement and utters a command in a foreign language, which prompts two men to grab Dom and bring him to the upper floor of the cabin. A younger woman enters the basement and explains that preparations are being made for sacrifice. Some time later, Dom is escorted back to the basement, beaten and bloodied, but still alive. He explains to Luke that he will serve as a human sacrifice to the creature, and instructs him to find a way to escape and destroy the village.
Dom is taken outside of the cabin and brought to a wooden post, where his hands are tied behind his back. As day shifts to night, a roar can be heard from the forest. The captors immediately fall to their knees in worship. Dom has a vision of his wife emerging from the trees and holding his face in her hands. This is in reality the creature that has been pursuing the men, and it bears a resemblance to the wooden effigy they discovered in the abandoned cabin. The creature removes Dom from the post and impales him on the branches of a nearby tree, leaving him to die. Desperate to escape, Luke breaks from one of his restraints by breaking his thumb, but cannot undo the second one before he is interrupted by the young woman's sudden entrance. When Luke asks about the creature, she explains that it is called a Jötunn, a god-like figure stemming from Scandinavian mythology, and that they provide it sacrifices in return for immortality. She states that Luke will take part in a ritual where he will submit to the creature and join the cult, or be killed.
After she leaves, Luke breaks free from his constraints and leaves the basement. He takes a torch and uses it to burn a room full of mummified, but sentient, corpses. This act enrages the Jötunn, who emerges from the forest to find the cabin burning. In a rage, the creature kills the worshipers. Luke uses this opportunity to escape from the burning cabin undetected, armed with a rifle and an axe. Before running into the woods, Luke aims and takes a shot at the creature as it is about to kill a worshiper. The creature pursues him, using an unexplained magical power to manifest his nightmares into reality in order to disorient him. The creature eventually catches him, and forces him onto his knees multiple times, offering Luke a chance to submit. He uses an axe which he had previously taken from one of the worshipers to strike the creature on its head. He then follows the sunlight, emerging from the forest into an open field. The creature does not emerge from the treeline, as it seems unable to follow. The monster roars at him, and he screams back in triumph and agony. Luke turns from the monster and heads in the direction of a paved road with a passing car, a sign of civilization."
I Kill Giants,"Barbara Thorson is a young, independent teenager who lives with her brother and supportive older sister, Karen. Barbara has created a fantasy world inspired by her love of Dungeons & Dragons and the career of former Phillies pitcher, Harry Coveleski. Believing that giants from other worlds are coming to attack her hometown, she spends her days creating weapons and traps to fend off the creatures.
One day, Barbara meets Sophia, who just moved to the area from Leeds, England. Sophia expresses an interest in getting to know Barbara, but Barbara initially remains aloof.
A confrontation between Barbara and a group of bullies led by Taylor is interrupted by Barbara being called by the school psychologist, Mrs. Mollé. Barbara leaves the ensuing meeting abruptly, declaring that their talk would just distract her from her preparations to battle a giant. Later, Barbara explains the mythology behind the giants to Sophie. She shows Sophia the baits and traps she created to lure and trap giants, and tells her about the magical warhammer, Coveleski, which she keeps in her handbag. She also tells Sophia about Harbingers, ghostly creatures that warn her when there is a nearby giant.
After Barbara is given detention by the principal for insulting a teacher, she takes Sophie with her on her hunt for a giant. Sophia begins to doubt Barbara's claims about the giants.
When Mrs. Mollé learns about Barbara's interest in baseball, she asks about it, causing Barbara to become lost in bad memories and to run home. In a daze, she is startled by Sophie and strikes her, causing Taylor and her friends -who witnessed it- to laugh. Though Barbara tries to apologize, Sophie runs off, upset. Later, Sophie is approached by Taylor who promises to tell her a secret about Barbara if Sophie will show them some of the ""freaky things"" Barbara does. Sophie agrees, leading Taylor and friends to the sanctuary, where they proceed to dismantle many of Barbara's traps. Barbara interrupts and draws Covaleski, which turns out to be a small animal's jawbone tied to a stick. Barbara is shocked at the state of her weapon, and is beaten by Taylor and friends.
Sophia takes Barbara to her home to recover. When Barbara wakes, she becomes very upset at being brought upstairs, and tells Sophie to slowly move away, before ""it"" sees her. Sophia looks into one of the bedrooms and drops a glass of water in shock before fleeing the house. Barbara visits Mrs. Mollé at her house looking for help, but grows uncomfortable upon being introduced to her family.
After Barbara fails to go to school for several days, Sophie and Mrs. Mollé visit Barbara's house. In the basement, Sophie discovers a recording of Barbara and her mother telling the story of Coveleski's ""Giant Killer"" nickname. Sophia leaves and finds Barbara, telling her that all of the giants are in her head, and asks Barbara why she never told Sophie about her mother. Barbara angrily storms off. She is visited by Harbingers who taunt her, telling her that she is too weak to defeat a giant.
Barbara heads to face the giant at an abandoned train yard. She hides in the trains, but is hunted by the giant. She eventually activates a train control station rigged to nearby electrical poles, which electrocutes it and sets fire to some of the train cars. Sophie arrives just as Barbara is leaving. The next day, Barbara humiliates Taylor by placing a skeleton in her locker. This worries Mrs. Mollé and Karen who proceed to look for Barbara. Barbara heads to her sanctuary upon discovering that she still can't use Coveleski, where she prays for the return of her weapon.
As an unexpected storm bears down on the town, Mrs. Mollé confronts Barbara on her way to the sanctuary, telling her that Barbara's mother is desperate to see her. Barbara ignores her. Upon arriving, she witnesses a scene of destruction. Sophia explains that Taylor wrecked the area as revenge for what Barbara did and that she tried to stop her. Suddenly, a giant appears out of the water. Barbara stands against it, and draws forth the restored Coveleski from her handbag, revealing a massive, glowing war hammer. She proceeds to defeat the titan with it, fueled by her wrath that it came for her mother. Laying injured upon the beach, the titan reveals that he came for Barbara, not her mother. Barbara is stunned, and demands that the titan ""finish it"". The titan snatches her up, and draws her close to its head, so she can strike it down with Coveleski. As the titan falls back into the ocean, it brings Barbara with it. Sinking below the waves, she hears the voice of the titan telling her that every living thing must die. It says to run from death is to reject life, and that she must find joy in every moment while she can. Barbara swims back to the beach, where she reunites with Sophie.
The next day, Barbara climbs upstairs to see her mother, who lays dying in her bed. They share heartfelt messages and Barbara apologizes for avoiding her. After the summer break, Barbara's mother dies, but Barbara rekindles her relationships with Mrs. Mollé, Karen and Sophia. On the first night of school, she is awoken by the titan, who stands in the ocean, watching her. She says thank you and goes back to sleep."
Disobedience,"After the death of her father, photographer Ronit Krushka returns to the Orthodox Jewish community she grew up in and that shunned her decades earlier for her childhood attraction to a female friend, Esti Kuperman. Their reunion soon reignites their passion as they explore the boundaries of faith and sexuality.[2]"
Woman Walks Ahead,"Catherine Weldon, a portrait painter from 1890s Brooklyn, travels to Dakota to paint a portrait of Sitting Bull and becomes embroiled in the Lakota peoples' struggle over the rights to their land."
Breathe,"Robin Cavendish falls ill from polio at age 28, not long after meeting and marrying his wife Diana. Paralyzed from the neck down and unable to breathe without the assistance of a respirator, he is given only three months to live. Initially he is depressed, refusing to see his wife or newborn son Jonathan and wishing to be removed from life support, but Diana is persistent, and slowly his spirits improve. When Diana realizes she can provide for his daily care and suggests they move Robin and the respirator home, Robin brightens considerably. Over the strenuous objections of the hospital's administrator Dr. Entwistle (who tells Diana that he will die if without the ventilator for two minutes) and with the help of some of the other doctors and nurses, Robin is brought home and meets his son.
While Jonathan is playing, he knocks out the plug of the ventilator. Robin sees, but unable to move or speak, he cannot get Diana's attention, so instead makes clicking noises with his tongue. Eventually, Diana finds him and plugs it back in.
Seeing his son push a pram gives Robin the idea for a mobile chair with a built-in respirator, so he enlists the help of his friend Teddy Hall to build one. Using the chair, and with the help of Diana and her two brothers, Robin is able to travel away from home for the first time, and with a specially constructed van, the family begins to venture out further, even flying the van on a cargo plane to Spain.
Teddy makes various improvements to his design over time, and eventually Robin teams up with Don McQueen to produce more of the chairs. After observing a German hospital's prison-like confinement of their severely disabled patients, Robin then appears at a conference and appeals to doctors to treat their patients more humanely, drawing a standing ovation. Robin returns to his original hospital with more of Teddy's chairs, and the rest of the patients in the ward leave with him.
Years later, Robin begins to experience severe bleeding due to his extended time on the respirator, and decides it is time to stop prolonging his life indefinitely. He holds a farewell party with his many friends, and sometime later, instructs his family to leave the house and return at precise times. Diana and Jonathan, now in his twenties, see McQueen driving away, and return to the house. Fading, Robin expresses his love for both of them, and dies, having transformed the lives of many others like him.[3]"
Crowhurst,"A tragedy that is both grand and pathetic. In October 1968, Donald Crowhurst, a 35-year-old engineer and father of four, embarked on one of the last great adventures of the 20th Century. He was one of nine men who set out from the English coast that autumn as part of the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, chasing to be either the first or the fastest man to circumnavigate the globe – single-handed and non-stop. But for Donald the dream turned into a nightmare."
Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"A year after the events of the previous film, Eggsy Unwin has officially joined Kingsman, taken his late mentor Harry Hart's title of Galahad and begun a relationship with Tilde, Crown Princess of Sweden. On his way home from the tailor shop, he is ambushed by Charlie Hesketh, a former Kingsman trainee who lost his arm and vocal cords during the Valentine incident, replacing them with cybernetics. Eggsy evades Charlie and his henchmen in a car chase across London, but Charlie's severed cybernetic arm hacks into the Kingsman servers through the computer system of Eggsy's car. Charlie passes on the information gained to Poppy Adams, the leader of the world's largest drug cartel, the Golden Circle. Poppy uses the information to launch a volley of missiles that destroy the Kingsman headquarters and wipe out all of the agents in Britain, aside from Eggsy and Merlin, Kingsman's tech support.
Eggsy and Merlin follow an emergency protocol which leads them to Statesman, an American private intelligence service posing as a Bourbon whiskey distillery in Kentucky. There, they discover that Harry survived his shooting thanks to Statesman technology, but is suffering from amnesia. They also learn about the Golden Circle from Statesman head Champagne and the two agencies agree to work together to bring it down. Statesman agent Tequila later develops a blue rash and shows signs of mania and is replaced by another agent, Whiskey, as Eggsy's partner. Eggsy plants a tracking device on Charlie's ex-girlfriend Clara Von Gluckfberg during a sexual encounter at Glastonbury Festival, but his revelation of the mission to Princess Tilde strains their relationship.
Eggsy later manages to cure Harry's amnesia by threatening to shoot a Cairn Terrier puppy that resembles Harry's late dog, shortly before Poppy broadcasts a message telling the world about a toxin she has added to all her drugs, which causes users to develop symptoms like Tequila's before progressing to paralysis and ultimately death. She offers the antidote to the world if the President of the United States ends his country's war on drugs and grants her cartel immunity from prosecution. The President decides to have everyone affected quarantined, intending to let them all die in order to put Poppy out of business.
Eggsy, Harry and Whiskey track Clara to the Golden Circle's antidote factory in Italy. Eggsy manages to steal an antidote sample, but it is broken by Whiskey during an ambush by the Golden Circle's henchmen, leading Harry to suspect him of working against them. Harry shoots Whiskey in the head, but Eggsy, believing Harry to be delusional as a result of his recovery, saves him with the same technology that Statesman used to save Harry. Princess Tilde calls Eggsy in a state of mania, revealing that she has been affected by the blue rash, having taken drugs due to her stress over Eggsy's infidelity. Eggsy, Harry and Merlin discover the location of Poppy's hideout, ""Poppy Land"", in Cambodia and fly there to steal the laptop which can deploy the drones carrying the antidote all over the world.
Upon their arrival at Poppy Land, Eggsy steps on a land mine, but Merlin sacrifices himself to save him and Harry. Eggsy and Harry storm through the lair; Eggsy kills Charlie, while Harry destroys Poppy's robotic attack dogs with the help of Elton John, who had been kidnapped by Poppy during the events of the previous film. They secure the laptop and inject Poppy with a concentrated dose of her toxin and heroin. Poppy gives them the laptop password in exchange for the antidote, but dies of an overdose from the heroin. Whiskey interrupts them before they can deploy the drones, revealing that he wants all drug users to die after his pregnant wife was killed in a robbery committed by two methamphetamine users. Eggsy and Harry fight and kill Whiskey, then deploy the drones to release the antidote and save the affected victims throughout the world.
In the aftermath, the President is impeached for conspiring to commit genocide on the drug victims and Statesman purchases a distillery in Scotland to help rebuild Kingsman. Statesman tech support specialist Ginger Ale is appointed to the position of Whiskey, Eggsy marries Princess Tilde and Tequila joins Kingsman, which acquires a new tailor shop in London."
Goodbye Christopher Robin,"The film begins during WWII in 1941, with Alan Alexander Milne – nicknamed ""Blue"" by his friends and family – and his wife Daphne receiving a distressing telegram at their home. It then changes time frame to 1916 during WWI with Blue fighting in the Battle of the Somme. He resumes his life with his wife, Daphne, in England while suffering shell shock with occasional flashbacks to his battle experiences and having a child with Daphne. She was hoping for a girl and is disappointed to instead have a son, whom they name Christopher Robin Milne but call ""Billy Moon"" after he mispronounces his last name. They hire a nanny, Olive, whom Billy calls ""Nou"".
Blue is having difficulty resuming his writing – he wants to draft a compelling treatise against the war – and relocates the family to a house in the country with wooded acreage. Daphne resents the move and returns to London for a few weeks. During that period, Nou goes to care for her dying mother and the cook takes some time off, leaving Blue and Billy to fend for themselves. Reluctantly at first, Blue takes Billy along on walks in the woods and begins making up stories about the boy's adventures with the stuffed animals the parents have bought for him along the way.
Blue invites his illustrator friend Ernest to join them at the house, and together they begin to develop the Winnie-the-Pooh books. Daphne returns to the house after Blue sends her a poem ""Vespers"", that she has published in Vanity Fair. Nou returns following her mother's death. After the Winnie-the-Pooh books become a success, Daphne manages their newfound celebrity. As Christopher Robin, Billy makes frequent public appearances which he finds confusing and frustrating. After Billy tells his parents Nou has a beau, Alfred, she becomes angry with them, resigns, and admonishes Blue and Daphne for what they are putting Billy through. Blue resolves to stop writing about the boy and his imaginary friends.
Blue ends Billy's publicity activities and enrolls him at a boarding school. ""Christopher Robin"" is bullied at the school and emerges bitter toward his father. When WWII breaks out, Billy is initially declared unfit for the draft, but he demands that his well-connected father – despite being horrified by war and the prospect of his son experiencing what he did – convince the army to accept him regardless. Billy leaves for service, turning his back on his father and disowning the books and the money from them.
The opening scene is replayed, this time explaining that Billy has been reported missing and is presumed dead – news his parents pass along to Nou. However, Billy has survived and arrives at the country house without warning, leading to awkward but tearful reunions with his parents and Nou. Blue and Billy have a reconciliation of sorts, and they are seen walking in the woods as a young child and younger man."
Anna and the Apocalypse,"When the zombie apocalypse hits the sleepy town of Little Haven at Christmas, teenager Anna and her high school friends have to fight, sing and dance to survive, with the undead horde all around them."
The Foreigner,"Ngoc Minh Quan, a Chinese Nuang chef, runs a Chinese restaurant in London. When his teenage daughter Fan is killed in a clothing store bombing, a distraught Quan seeks revenge. The bombing is claimed by a group calling themselves the ""Authentic UDI"" in the film version released in Europe and ""Authentic IRA"" in the version released in certain other countries.[4][5] He first attempts to bribe Scotland Yard officer Richard Bromley for the names of the bombers, but Bromley refuses to accept the bribe or reveal any information. Quan next focuses on the Northern Ireland deputy First Minister Liam Hennessy, who speaks publicly about his status as a former UDI (read: IRA) leader while condemning the bombing. Keyi Lam, Quan's colleague and personal friend, attempts to console and convince him to move on, but he refuses to be swayed and eventually leaves for Belfast to meet Hennessy. Hennessy claims to have no knowledge of the bombing or its perpetrators, but Quan does not believe him. His queries escalate until he becomes fixated on Hennessy, setting off a homemade bomb in his office and threatening more unless he gets the bombers' names.
The truth is that Hennessy, while having ordered the bombings to come with warnings as part of a political ploy to solidify the radical factions, does not actually know who the bombers are, as they are rogue members of the UDI. He is in fact outraged that no warnings were given and civilians were killed. Hennessy tries to identify the bombers by changing the code words they use after any bombings are carried out, but the rogue members catch on and outwit him. Meanwhile, he sends numerous mercenaries and personal enforcers after Quan, who manages to escape or defeat all of them. He also observes Hennessy meeting with his mistress, Maggie, and takes a picture of them kissing. Quan then brings the fight to Hennessy, hiding in the woods outside his Belfast farmhouse and attacking it with more homemade bombs. As Hennessy's men attempt to track him in the woods, Quan uses traps to disable a group of three and attempts to interrogate one of them, but he is shot in the shoulder by a fourth mercenary and flees. Hennessy decides to send for his nephew Sean Morrison, who was part of the Royal Irish Regiment with Bromley, after Quan in hopes that his tracking skills can be used to stop him for good.
As Quan heats up a knife to cauterise the gunshot wound, he faints and has flashbacks of his escape from Vietnam to Singapore by sea, where he and his family are attacked by Thai pirates. He and his wife look on hopelessly as his two daughters are taken away to be raped and murdered by the pirates. As he tried to fight off the pirates, he and his wife were shot and both fell overboard. His wife later died giving birth to their daughter, Fan. Hennessy receives files from the British government on Quan's true background: a former Vietnam War special operations forces soldier who was trained by the US Army.
After a second bombing on a double-decker bus, Hennessy negotiates with British politician Katherine Davies and promises the capture of the bombers in exchange for the pardoning of some of his former UDI comrades. Meanwhile, Bromley manages to identify the bombers and relays their identities to Hennessy, who then relays the information to Sean. After a knife fight in the woods, Quan manages to capture Sean, who reveals the name of one of the bombers: Patrick O'Reilly, who was also behind the bombing that killed Quan's daughter. In return, Quan decides to let Sean go. Hennessy, meanwhile, interrogates his head enforcer McGrath, discovering that the true mastermind is Mary, Hennessy's wife, who also hired Maggie; she has never let go of her anger at the British for the death of her brother and resents Hennessy's working for them. Hennessy executes McGrath for his betrayal and for involving his wife and mistress, then orders Sean to execute Mary—with whom Sean is having an affair—before returning to America.
As the police prepare to raid the bombers' hideout, Quan manages to enter first under the pretense of fixing a gas leak and single-handedly kills all but Maggie. Quan leaves just before the police raid the apartment and find a severely wounded Maggie, whose real name is Sara McKay. They torture her into revealing the location of their next bomb, which has been planted in a laptop computer, to be detonated on a plane going to a security conference in Rome. British police manage to find and throw the laptop into an empty jet bridge, where it detonates without casualties. With the threat resolved, Bromley orders the operation leave ""no loose ends"", which results in Maggie's execution. Hennessy gets a call from Davies, who tells him that he will retain his position as a politician but will be under her thumb.
Quan confronts Hennessy and shows him the picture of Hennessy kissing Maggie, which is enough to throw suspicion on Hennessy and his role in the bombings, as well as expose his affairs if the public sees it. Quan forces him to post the picture to the internet, telling him that he should be ashamed of himself and the whole world will know that he is a terrorist. Meanwhile, Bromley realizes Quan's role in the events and has him put under surveillance, but decides not to take any further action as a way to thank him for his involvement.
The film ends with Quan returning to his restaurant and Lam embracing him as he puts the past behind him."
Ghost Stories,"In 1979, Phillip Goodman's strict Jewish father threw his sister out of the family for dating an Asian man. As an adult, Goodman is lonely and single; he is also a well-known professor who specializes in debunking fraudulent psychics on his TV show, and regards it as his life's work to stop people's lives being ruined by superstition the way his family's were. He receives an invitation to visit a famed 1970s paranormal investigator, Charles Cameron, who inspired him as a boy, but who has been missing for decades and is now living, sick and in poverty, in a caravan. The old man asks him to investigate three incidents of supposedly real supernatural ghost sightings.
The first case is a night watchman, Tony Matthews, whose wife has died of cancer and who feels guilty that he stopped visiting his daughter, who suffers from locked-in syndrome. He was haunted by the spirit of a young girl while working in a disused asylum for women. The second is a teenager, Simon Rifkind, who is obsessed with the occult and has a poor relationship with his parents. His car breaks down after running over the Devil in the woods. Goodman, although unsettled by the second case, believes that each of them has an obvious rational explanation: the supposed victims imagined them, based on their own neuroses. The third case is a financier in the City, Mike Priddle, who was plagued by a poltergeist while awaiting the birth of his child. His wife's ghost appeared to him as she died giving birth to an (it is implied) inhuman child. The financier commits suicide with a shotgun while talking to Goodman.
Goodman returns to the 1970s investigator, who tears a latex mask off of his face, revealing himself to be Priddle. Goodman at first believes that he is the victim of an elaborate hoax, but reality soon breaks down altogether. Priddle leads Goodman back in time to the scene of a childhood incident in which he watched two bullies entice a mentally handicapped boy into a drain, where he died of an asthma attack. Goodman has felt guilty all his life about his failure to rescue the victim. The decaying corpse of the bullied boy appears, tormenting Goodman and leading him to a hospital bed, where he is made to lie down. The ghoul lies on top of him and forces his finger into Goodman's mouth as Goodman cries ""no, not again"", implying this is a recurring event.
In the real world, Goodman is comatose in hospital with tubes in his mouth. He suffers from locked-in syndrome after a failed suicide attempt in his car. All the characters and events Goodman has experienced were inspired by the staff and objects in his hospital room. The doctors incorrectly believe that his persistent vegetative state allows him no awareness of his surroundings. The senior doctor predicts that Goodman is ""here for the duration"", without chance of recovery, and as he leaves the room says to his junior colleague, ""I hope his dreams are sweet""."
The Snowman,"At a remote cabin amidst heavy snowfall, a man named Jonas (Peter Dalle) confronts his former lover (Sofia Helin) about their illegitimate son. The woman threatens to tell Jonas' family about the child, and he leaves angrily in his car. The woman and her son pursue him, but lose him in the snow. She lets go of the steering wheel, causing the car to drive off the road onto a frozen lake. The boy manages to escape from the sinking car, but the woman stays inside in an apparent suicide.
Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is a brilliant but troubled inspector with the Norwegian Police Service's Oslo district, struggling with the recent divorce and remarriage of his wife Rakel (Charlotte Gainsbourg) to Mathias (Jonas Karlsson), a renowned surgeon, and their son Oleg, who is unaware that Harry is his biological father. Harry receives a mysterious letter signed with the drawing of a snowman, and is paired with a brilliant new recruit, Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson). The two are assigned to a missing persons case of Britte Becker (Genevieve O'Reilly), who vanished from her house after being followed home by a red Volvo.
The police receive a report of another missing woman named Sylvia Otterson (Chloe Sevigny). When Harry and Katrine travel to her farmhouse to investigate, they find her alive and well. They brush the report off as a prank call and leave, but shortly thereafter a figure wearing a black ski mask stalks and kills Sylvia outside her house, using a mechanized cutting tool to decapitate her. Harry receives another call about Otterson, and returning to the farmhouse comes face-to-face with her twin sister Ane. They search the property and find Sylvia's beheaded corpse inside her house, and her head atop a snowman inside an empty storage tank.
Connecting the letter with the presence of a snowman at the crime scene, Harry's research leads him to a previous case in Bergen, involving a similar set of circumstances. He travels to meet the case's investigating officer Gert Rafto (Val Kilmer), but upon arrival learns that Rafto died eight years prior through what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and that the case went cold after the apparent suicide. Inside Rafto's old cabin, he finds a jacket and a photograph that lead him to realize that Katrine is Rafto's daughter, and is likely out to find her father's real killer.
Katrine believes that Arve Stop (J. K. Simmons), a business tycoon implicated in the earlier case, is behind her father's death. Stop is involved in a high-class prostitution ring overseen by Idar Vetelsen (David Dencik), a doctor working at the hospital all the current victims had gone to. Britte's cell phone begins transmitting again, and the signal is traced to Vetelsen's house. When the police raid it, they find Vetelsen dead of a shotgun blast to the head, along with the remains of Britte and another victim named Hegen Dahl.
Katrine seduces Stop at a fundraiser event, and he asks her to wait in his hotel room. She sets a trap for him inside, but is attacked and drugged by a masked figure who severs her right finger and uses it to unlock the biometric security measures on her work tablet, wiping all the data from it. The next morning, Harry sees the impression of a snowman atop his snow-covered car, and inside finds Katrine's corpse in the driver's seat.
Rakel tells Harry that Oleg has run away after Harry missed a school camping trip in which he was supposed to have joined him. Oleg stays at a friend's house, and when Rakel arrives to tell Harry the two kiss and almost have sex. Mathias calls to tell Rakel that he is picking up Oleg to take him home. Upon returning home, Mathias drugs and ties up Rakel, then does likewise to Oleg, taking both of them to a cottage in Telemark. Harry tracks him down, where he has Rakel and Oleg hostage with the cutter to Rakel's throat. Mathias is revealed as the boy at the start of the film, who grew to hate his mother because she did not want him to know who his real father was. Harry attacks Mathias and manages to get the cutter off of Rakel's neck, losing a finger in the process. Mathias escapes and Harry gives pursuit, chasing him onto the ice. Mathias manages to shoot Harry, but the ice beneath his feet suddenly cracks and breaks apart, dropping him into the water below and dragging him under the current to his death.
After having his injuries treated, Harry returns to the police precinct, and volunteers for a new homicide case."

Crooked House,"The granddaughter of late business tycoon Aristide Leonides, Sophia Leonides, visits private investigator Charles Hayward in his office. Sophia hires Charles to investigate Aristide's death, for she believes he was murdered by a member of his sprawling and idiosyncratic family. Sophia notes that Leonides' regular insulin injection had been laced with eserine from his eye drops, the resulting chemicals in them causing him to die. Sophia believes this to have been a deliberate switch rather than accidental. Charles begrudgingly agrees to take on the case as a result of his feelings for Sophia as the two had enjoyed a brief love affair when they had met sometime prior in Cairo. Charles seeks the consent of Chief Inspector Taverner of Scotland Yard to look into the case, utilising his personal connection with Taverner, who had served with Charles's father, a decorated former Assistant Commissioner who was murdered.
Charles visits the Leonides estate and proceeds to interview the various members of the family, finding various motives from each. Charles begins with Lady Edith De Haviland, the sister of Leonides's first wife, who despised her brother-in-law and his callous attitude towards her grandchildren. Leonides's eldest son, Philip, hated his father for passing him over to run the family business and for refusing to take interest in a new play he'd written for his wife, Magda, a fading theatre actress. Philip and Magda provided Leonides with three grandchildren, namely Sophia and the precocious younger children Eustace and Josephine. Eustace takes a dislike to Charles and seeks to hamper him where possible whilst Josephine makes clear to Charles that she eavesdrops on everyone around the house, makes notes about their private lives and dislikes most of her family except for Edith and Sophia.
Charles subsequently finds that Leonides' younger son, Roger, the emotionally immature managing director of the family's flagship business, was reliant upon his father bailing out the business numerous times due to his poor management. The fact that Leonides was so willing to bail Roger out did not sit well with either Roger, due to his pride, or his domineering wife Clemency. Charles further finds that Leonides' second wife, Brenda, a much younger former Las Vegas casino dancer, is suspected by the rest of the family as having committed the murder. Evidence seems to back this up due to the facts that Brenda had been having an affair with Laurence Brown, the private tutor for the Leonides children, as well as that she administered the fatal dose of drugs to Leonides and that she stood to inherit the entirety of the Leonides estate due to him not having signed a will, meaning he died intestate and thus his estate passed to her.
Charles's investigations and questions are met with hostility by most of the family whilst Josephine cryptically hints at clues along the way, to Charles's irritation, as he finds her treating the investigation as a game to be tiresome. Events take a new, horrific turn when the ladder to Josephine's treehouse is sabotaged and she falls from the tree, being hospitalised as a result. Charles suspects that this was due to Josephine's habit of spying on the other family members and the killer thus wanting to silence her. In the aftermath, Charles's suspicions are heightened and even extend to Sophia after a new will is discovered in which Leonides had left his estate to her, with some arguing that Sophia hired Charles to investigate the murder due to their personal history, knowing he would never accuse her due to their romantic past.
After those developments, Taverner arrives in person to take charge of the case as he feels Charles' romantic history with Sophia does not make him objective enough to solve it. The discovery of love letters between Brenda and Laurence gives Taverner enough evidence to arrest them for Leonides' murder and the attempt on Josephine, to the delight of most of his family members who had always hated both. Charles, however, remains unconvinced that Brenda and Laurence are guilty, noting Brenda's childlike intelligence and Laurence's pacifist, left-wing views as making them unlikely candidates for being a murderer. Sophia and Edith seem to agree, with Sophia noting how the letters could have been forged and Edith paying for a top rate lawyer to represent Brenda and Laurence in court. In the meantime, however, Charles returns to London and only returns to the estate when Josephine's nanny dies after being poisoned by drinking a mug of hot chocolate that she had made for Josephine.
Charles implores Josephine to tell her who the killer is as he has worked out she knows their identity. Again, Josephine refuses to tell. After it is established that the nanny died of cyanide poisoning, Charles begins to suspect Edith as he knew she had been using cyanide to remove moles in the estate garden. His search of Edith's garden shed finds a bottle of cyanide as well as Josephine's missing notebook, complete with her notes on each member of the family. Edith drives out of the family estate with Josephine, having also left a note for Charles to find. Charles and Sophia take off in pursuit of Edith in a car chase to try and stop them. In the car, Sophia reads the note that Edith had left in which she confesses to the murder but Charles argues that he believes Edith is not the killer.
Sophia reads extracts from Josephine's notebook in which the child admits to murdering Leonides purely because he had refused to pay for her ballet lessons. The notebook further reveals that Josephine had also faked the attack on herself and had poisoned her nanny when the latter began to suspect Josephine. Lady Edith had worked out that Josephine was the killer and planted evidence and wrote the confession note to spare Josephine a life in psychiatric institutions and exonerate Brenda and Laurence. Edith had earlier been informed that she was dying of cancer and so decided to sacrifice herself to protect Josephine and the rest of the family. Edith realises that Charles and Sophia are pursuing her and so she drives her car over the clifftop of a quarry, killing herself and Josephine. The film ends as Charles comforts a shocked Sophia at the edge of the cliff."
Murder on the Orient Express,"In 1934, famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot solves a theft at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The obsessive-compulsive—who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth to be a curse — wants to rest in Istanbul, but must return to London for another case. His friend Bouc, director of the Simplon Orient Express, offers him a room aboard the train.
Unscrupulous businessman Edward Ratchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threatening letters from an unknown party, but Poirot refuses. That night, Poirot hears strange noises coming from Ratchett's compartment, and later sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers.
The next morning, Poirot discovers Ratchett was murdered during the night after having been stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the other passengers as repairs begin. Evidence indicates that Ratchett was murdered by one person, and Caroline Hubbard, a fellow passenger, claims that a man had been in her compartment in the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. After the ransom was paid, Daisy was found murdered. Ratchett's true identity is revealed: he was John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and murderer. The shock of her death caused her mother Sonia to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, Colonel John Armstrong, then committed suicide. The family's nursemaid Susanne was wrongly suspected of complicity, leading to her being arrested and subsequent suicide in police custody, only to be found innocent afterward.
More evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief, and, in Mrs. Hubbard's compartment, the button of a conductor's uniform. The uniform is later found, as is the red kimono — in Poirot's own suitcase. Hubbard is suddenly stabbed in the back; she survives but cannot identify the culprit. Poirot discovers many of the passengers have direct connections to the Armstrong family and uncovers their hidden pasts. While interviewing governess Mary Debenham, Doctor John Arbuthnot shoots Poirot in the shoulder, claiming responsibility for the murder, but Bouc stops him from killing Poirot. Poirot realizes that Arbuthnot — a medical doctor and former army sniper — never meant to kill him.
Poirot confronts the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how Cassetti died. The first is simple but does not meet all of the facts: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train at a previous stop, murdered Cassetti, and fled at the stop as the train left. The second is more complex: with every single suspect connected to the Armstrongs, Susanne, or her trial in some way, they all had a motive against Cassetti. Poirot predicts that they acted together. Hubbard is revealed to be Linda Arden, a former stage actress and aspiring director, and Sonia Armstrong's mother.
Hubbard confirms the latter, admitting that she planned the murder and had recruited everyone else to help her. All the other passengers and the Conductor, Pierre Michel (Susanne's brother), took turns stabbing Cassetti. Mary wore the kimono, and Arbuthnot stabbed Hubbard without endangering her life, to convince Poirot of a lone killer. Poirot challenges the passengers and Michel to shoot him with a confiscated gun since he is the only one who can expose their plot; Bouc can lie, but Poirot, obsessed with truth and balance, cannot. Hubbard grabs the gun and tries to kill herself, but it is not loaded; Poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.
With the train back on track, Poirot concludes that justice is impossible in the case, as Cassetti deserved death; for the first time, Poirot will have to live with a lie and imbalance. He presents the lone killer theory to the Yugoslavian police, allowing the others to leave on the train. As he disembarks, a British Army messenger asks him to investigate a death on the Nile. Poirot accepts the case."
Paddington 2,"Paddington, having settled with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, has become popular in his community, offering people emotional support in various ways. To purchase a unique pop-up book of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages, but the book is stolen. Paddington chases the thief, who escapes, and Paddington is framed and arrested. Although Mr. Gruber and the Browns do not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence that the thief even existed, Paddington is wrongfully convicted and jailed. The thief soon returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical actor who lives opposite the Browns.
Whilst in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, including the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who hires Paddington, impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief. Buchanan begins using the pop-up book to locate a series of clues within London's famous landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure, wearing a different disguise for each visit. During their efforts to prove Paddington's innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the stolen book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author. They start investigating the landmarks on the popup book and discover a suspicious character (Buchanan) has been visiting each one as well.
With Paddington inside, the prison is a much livelier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to prove his innocence but keep hunting. Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, as well as the book itself, discovering that each of the suspicious characters visiting the landmarks were Buchanan. Before they can act further, Buchanan returns home and suspects something is wrong. Meanwhile, the Browns reveal what they have discovered to the police, only to be informed that they need stronger evidence, such as the book with his fingerprints on it, to prove that he is guilty. They miss a prison visit with Paddington, causing Paddington to believe that the Browns have forgotten all about him.
Paddington soon takes part in a prison break alongside several other inmates, including Knuckles, who promises to aid in proving his innocence but promptly abandons the idea in order to leave the country as a free man, inviting Paddington to come with him. Paddington refuses and, whilst roaming the streets and avoiding the police, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave shortly.
Paddington reaches the station and makes it onto the train just as it leaves - the Browns begin their pursuit on another steam train at the opposite platform. When caught up, Henry Brown and Mrs. Bird board the other train and confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and makes good his initial escape. Paddington is left trapped in the train's rear carriage, the coupling of which Buchanan severs and switches down a different track, leaving it to crash into a nearby river. Mary Brown tries to rescue Paddington but struggles to open the locked carriage; she is soon assisted by Knuckles and the other inmates, who have a change of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised. Eventually, Henry knocks out Buchanan just as he tries to access the so-called treasure, and he is promptly taken into custody.
Paddington, now declared innocent, becomes very ill after the events, slipping into a short three-day coma yet recovering upon waking up on Aunt Lucy's birthday. With the book taken in as evidence by the police, Paddington is disappointed that he was unable to buy Lucy a present as promised, though soon discovers the Browns, with the help of various other people in the neighbourhood including Mr. Curry, made sure Lucy could come to London and see it for herself. When answering the door to her, Paddington rushes up and hugs her, wishing her a happy birthday.
Meanwhile, Buchanan is sentenced to 10 years in prison. Six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use, hosting shows for the inmates and providing entertainment throughout the building."

All the Money in the World,"In 1973, 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Paul), grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty who was at that time the world's richest private citizen, is kidnapped in Rome by an organized crime ring. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $17 million. Flashbacks show that Paul's parents, Gail Harris and John Paul Getty Jr., were divorced in 1971 due to Getty Jr.'s drug addiction and that Gail rejected any alimony in exchange for full custody of her children in the divorce settlement; therefore she does not have the means to pay the ransom. She travels to Getty's estate to beseech him to pay the ransom but he refuses, stating that it would encourage further kidnappings on his family members. The media picks up on the story, with many believing Gail to be rich herself and blaming her for the refusal to pay the ransom. Meanwhile, Getty asks Fletcher Chace, a Getty Oil negotiator and former CIA operative, to investigate the case and secure Paul's release.
Paul is kept hostage in a remote location in Italy. Initially his captors, particularly Cinquanta, are tolerant with him because his quiet and submissive demeanor causes them few problems. However, things grow increasingly tense as weeks go by without the ransom being paid, far longer than the captors anticipated. Arguments arise over whether to move Paul to a new location as winter is approaching and their hideout is not suitable for cold conditions. Things get worse when one of the kidnappers accidentally shows his face to Paul, prompting one of the others to kill the man for his foolish mistake. His burned and disfigured body is recovered in the river; investigators erroneously identify the body as Paul's, but Gail examines the body and refutes this.
Using the new lead of the body, Chace is able to pinpoint the hideout where Paul is being held. A raid is conducted with several kidnappers being killed, but Paul is no longer there; he had been sold on to a new crime organization. The new captors are much less patient with Paul and negotiate more aggressively with the Getty family to receive their payment. After repeated negotiations with Gail and Chace, and frustration from the captors at how long the process was taking, they lower the asking price to $4 million. Getty finally decides to contribute to the ransom, but only $1 million – this being the maximum amount that he can claim as tax deductible. Moreover, he also will only do so if Gail signs a legal document waiving her parental access rights to Paul and her other children, giving them to Getty's son, her ex-husband. She reluctantly signs them.
The kidnappers cut off one of Paul's ears and mail it to a major newspaper, claiming that they will continue mutilating him until the ransom is paid. Berated by an exasperated Chace, Getty finally relents and agrees to pay the full ransom, also voiding the parental agreement with Gail. Gail and Chace take the money to Italy and follow specific instructions from the captors, leaving the money in a remote location and receiving orders to pick up Paul from a construction site. However, a frightened Paul runs away from the site towards the nearest town, miles away. Meanwhile the captors realize that Chace has broken his word and led the police to them; angry, they decide to find and kill Paul. Chace, Gail, and the captors arrive at the town to look for Paul. One of the kidnappers finds Paul first, but Cinquanta attacks the man in order to allow Paul to escape. Chace and Gail find Paul and smuggle him out of the country to safety.
Getty dies of unrelated causes, and Gail is tasked with managing her children's inherited wealth until they are of age. The company was set up as a charitable trust, which meant that Getty's income was tax-free but also not spendable. He had invested much of it in paintings, sculptures and other artifacts, most of them now reside in the Getty Museum in Los Angeles."

"All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception and the Spirit of I. F. Stone","All Governments Lie: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone described Independent journalist I. F.

ARQ,"Renton wakes up beside his former lover, Hannah. Three men break into his bedroom and take him hostage. Renton breaks his neck while escaping and wakes with a start, only for the men to break in once again. He and Hannah are taken to another room and bound to chairs. The leader of the group introduces himself as Father, identifying the others as Sonny and Brother; Cuz died of electrocution after touching a large device, the ARQ, in the room. Father says he represents a rebel group known as the Bloc and demands Renton surrender money, or ""scrips"", from their rival organization, the Torus Corporation. He gives them several minutes to comply and leaves the room with the others to get food.
Renton explains to Hannah the ARQ is a working perpetual motion machine he designed at Torus. After Torus shut down the project as an impossibility, he stole it. Renton believes the Bloc members to be after the ARQ rather than the scrips, though Hannah urges him to comply with their demands. After freeing himself and Hannah, he is killed while trying to escape. Renton wakes up gasping, only to relive the same scenario. This time, after freeing himself, he asks Hannah to help poison the intruders with cyanide gas. This fails when Hannah reveals herself as allied with them. Renton surrenders the scrips, only to be killed again after Sonny shoots him.
After reviving, Renton questions Hannah about her past. She says she grew to resent Renton after he abandoned her to Torus, who tortured her. Renton says he never gave up looking for her after he escaped. Though he does not trust Hannah, Renton frees her. They work out a deal where they will split the scrips after using the cyanide gas to force Father and his group to stand down. Renton reneges on the deal, demanding that Hannah abandon the Bloc and come with him. She refuses and accidentally shoots Renton during a scuffle. Renton and Hannah wake in bed; this time, both recall the events. When Renton says the ARQ is causing a time loop, Hannah insists he give the technology to the Bloc. Eventually, Sonny reveals himself as a Torus mercenary and kills everyone.
When they wake, Renton and Hannah agree they must keep the ARQ from Torus, though Renton expresses distrust in the Bloc. They convince Father to help them, but Sonny shoots Father and knocks Brother unconscious. After killing Sonny, Renton applies first aid to Father. He dies after Brother shoots him, not realizing Sonny is responsible. The next iteration, Sonny becomes aware of the time loop and immediately kills Father and Brother. Renton theorizes the ARQ is looping the same three-hour period due to running out of energy. Instead of producing unlimited energy, its fuel cells are refilled after every loop. When Sonny overpowers them, Renton sacrifices himself to prevent Sonny from acquiring the ARQ.
In the next iteration, Sonny saves Cuz's life, then kills Father and Brother. Renton and Hannah poison Sonny and Cuz with the cyanide. Before dying, Sonny uses the pool of blood from every other corpse (including Cuz, whom he kills) to set up a trap. After arguing not to destroy the machine, Hannah is electrocuted when she accidentally steps on Sonny's trap. Renton briefly considers destroying the ARQ but allows the next iteration to begin. He admits he was wrong and offers the ARQ to the Bloc. Father, who is now aware of the time loop, and Brother agree to work with Hannah and Renton; however, Sonny and Cuz take all hostage. After Sonny forces Renton to disable the machine, Father and Brother die in the confusion of a blackout. Renton and Hannah briefly escape but return once they realize the time loop is localized to the house.
After they kill Cuz, revealed to be a torturer for Torus, Sonny restarts the ARQ, only to be killed. An interrupted video message and the ARQ's logs reveal a second, outer time loop: every nine time loops form their own loop in which their memories are reset. Unknowingly, they have repeated the same nine loops thousands of times. Realizing they are on their ninth loop, Renton and Hannah leave a desperate message to themselves, hoping future iterations can get the ARQ to the Bloc before Torus' reinforcements arrive. After a robot breaks through and kills them, Hannah wakes with a gasp."

Weary of involving the RCMP, Noah believes he can reason with Dany, and Carmen insists on accompanying him.

Carmen asks him what he did to Gilles, with Dany replying Gilles' death was an accident, but the police would never believe him. As the situation begins to de-escalate, Carmen speaks to Ani, who witnessed Gilles' death. Dany was pressing Gilles for money before accusing him and other whites of coming to the Arctic and seducing local women, including Ani. The argument led to shoving, during which Gilles tripped and fell over a cliff. After Dany is defused, the group takes boats back to the mainland, with Carmen asking Ani if Simigaq will ever know about Gilles. Ani replies she and everyone in the community will tell Simigaq about Gilles."

Spark,"Thirteen years ago, the evil primate General Zhong overthrew his noble brother to seize the throne of the planet Bana, using a spacetime anomaly known as a ""slick"", which has the ability to create black holes; slicks were made by a wild creature known as a space kraken. The black hole created from the slick partially destroyed Bana, and swallowed up many subjects. Among the few survivors were a baby monkey named Spark, a warrior fox named Vix, and a pig mechanic named Chunk.
In the present, Spark, Vix, Chunk and Spark's forgetful nanny bot, Bananny, secretly live on a shard used as a garbage dump, with Vix and Chunk leading insurgency missions against Zhong, although they constantly forbid Spark from coming along. One day, Spark intercepts an e-mail sent to Vix about a new mission, and decides to take the mission himself without her knowing. The e-mail leads to the Queen of Bana, whom Zhong still permits to live in the palace. After Spark infiltrates the palace and meets the Queen, she hands him a kraken-finder, which Zhong wants to use to find and recapture the space kraken in order to destroy another planet. Spark decides to use it to find the kraken himself; he tames the creature and brings it back to the garbage shard. But he then finds his home raided by Zhong's forces, who then capture both him and the kraken. Zhong forces the kraken to make a new slick into which he hurls Spark, Vix, Chunk and the entire garbage shard.
The trio discover that the slick is actually a wormhole that leads to a desert planet. Vix and Chunk get upset at Spark for causing Zhong to obtain the kraken, and then split up. Spark finds survivors of the first slick, living in the King's old flagship battle cruiser. The Captain of the flagship reveals that Spark is in fact the son of the King and Queen, who entrusted Vix and Chunk to hide and protect him.

Spark then learns from the deceased King that his friends have been captured by giant mutated roaches. Spark, with the help of his father's spirit and his roach friend, Floyd, defeats the mutated roaches and rescues Vix and Chunk. Spark rallies Vix, Chunk, the Captain and his survivors to mount an attack on Zhong, and Chunk figures out a way to use technology to make a slick of their own. In the meantime, Zhong uses the space kraken to intimidate the rest of the galaxy.
The flagship and survivors return to Bana through their own slick, and ultimately defeat Zhong's forces after a prolonged battle. Spark personally rescues the queen from Zhong's own flagship, which gets critically damaged during the battle. Spark decides to rescue his ""Uncle"" Zhong as well, but the annoyed Queen then punches Zhong into the slick after he ""begs"" for forgiveness.
The film ends with Spark's friends and allies celebrating him becoming the new Prince of Bana."
Special Correspondents,"News radio journalist Frank Bonneville (Eric Bana) enters a murder scene posing as a cop. After getting the details of the crime, he is removed from the premises and, immediately after, reports the story live on the radio. When he returns to the station, Frank is applauded by colleagues on getting the story before any other press, but his boss Geoffrey Mallard (Kevin Pollak) warns that if he breaks the law one more time, he'll be fired.
That night, everyman Ian Finch (Ricky Gervais), who is also Frank's sound technician, takes his wife Eleanor (Vera Farmiga) to the station's annual ball, but has to leave for a stake-out with co-worker Claire Maddox (Kelly Macdonald). Eleanor then meets Frank, who sleeps with her, unaware she is married to Finch. The following day, Mallard puts Frank on a story about an uprising in Ecuador, and assigns Finch to accompany him. However, Finch tells Frank he can't go as Eleanor has left him. He also says he's written a letter, begging her not to end their marriage.
Finch later changes his mind about Ecuador, and he and Frank pack for their trip. At the airport, the two realize Finch has accidentally thrown their passports and plane tickets in a garbage truck. Frank and Finch return to the city and hide out at a café owned by Spanish couple Brigida and Domingo (America Ferrera and Raúl Castillo), located across the street from the radio station. With Brigida and Domingo's help, Frank and Finch fake their war reports in the couple's spare room.
After Finch and Frank decide they need to cover a bigger story, they invent a man named Emilio Santiago Alvarez, whom they claim is elusive and closely linked to the war. This report alerts the U.S. government, who now believe that Frank and Finch are targets for Alvarez's men. Meanwhile, Frank and Finch watch as other media outlets report on Alvarez, including their TV rival John Baker (Benjamin Bratt). Mallard calls Frank, asking for the two men to go to the U.S. embassy in Quito, where they will then be flown home. Panicking that they'll be found out, Frank and Finch destroy their SIM cards so they cannot be traced.
The next morning, Frank fails to check in with Mallard, worrying the station. The media begins reporting about Finch and Frank's disappearance. Claire visits Eleanor to offer her sympathy, but Eleanor seems more interested in getting her story out. Frank and Finch stage a hostage situation, and send out a message to the President, asking for a ransom or they will be executed. Later, Frank and Finch watch as Eleanor appears on TV. This prompts Frank to find out about her identity as Finch's wife. She then performs a song, ""Dollar for a Hero"", appealing for their safe return.
Eleanor subsequently becomes a national sensation and sets up a charity for Finch and Frank. Mallard asks Claire to get to know Eleanor, who is using her husband's plight so she can start a singing career. Finch accepts Eleanor's selfishness in the situation and says he's no longer upset that she left him. On Finch's birthday, he admits he can't keep up the charade any longer. Finch and Frank stop off at his apartment to take some of the donated money, but Eleanor catches them. The three decide to split the cash so they can all get what they want. Frank and Finch drive cross-country and sail illegally to Ecuador. They hitch a ride to Quito from a local, but first stop off at a rundown bar. There, they are held at gunpoint and taken to a small village, where they are locked up. Thinking they're going to die, Frank admits to Finch that he slept with Eleanor.
The next morning, the captors demand ransom from Eleanor but she refuses and tells them to kill Frank and Finch. When a captor returns, planning for them to fight to the death, Frank steals his gun and Finch ends up shooting him. They escape by stealing a car, make it to the U.S. embassy, and are flown home on a private jet. On returning home, they are greeted by the Secretary of State, press, friends and family. Frank makes a speech, and Finch bypasses Eleanor to greet Domingo and Brigida. Eleanor then speaks to press about her upcoming album, while Finch takes off his wedding ring. He approaches Claire, whom he realizes likes him for who he is. The pair happily walk off towards the city together."

Window Horses,"Rosie Ming lives in Vancouver with Gloria and Stephen, her maternal grandparents who are of Chinese descent. Rosie's mother Caroline died in a car accident when Rosie was a child. An aspiring poet with a fixation on Paris, France, Rosie collects her poems in a book which she self-publishes. The book gets the attention of the organizers of a poetry festival in Shiraz, Iran. Though Gloria is adamantly opposed to Rosie going to Iran, she eventually relents after seeing Rosie's determination. Her grandparents pack a black chador for Rosie to wear in Iran, though Rosie soon finds many festival guests are confused by her appearance as Rosie is not a devout Muslim and women in Iran are not required by law to wear chadors.
Among the poets, Rosie meets at the festival are festival cultural ambassador Mehrnaz, Chinese poet Di Di, and German poet Dietmar. At a competition early in the festival, Rosie performs one of her poems by singing it, but is scored poorly by the judges as she was unaware that a woman singing in public is considered provocative in Iran. Mehrnaz remains supportive, later on bringing Rosie to the tomb of famous Shiraz poet Hafez for inspiration. In contrast, Dietmar is relentlessly disdainful of Rosie's poetic style and hangup for Paris. However, Dietmar's satirical poem about wealthy Europeans feeding expensive food to their dogs at the dinner table is badly received, not realizing until after his performance the local audience found the premise of dogs eating at the table alongside humans to be deeply offensive. Rosie calms a panicked Dietmar with the idea of a slam, wherein both poets improvise a poem together. Their improvisation goes over well with their audience, and Dietmar reconciles with Rosie.
A traditional consultation with the poems of Hafez leads Mehmaz to assign Rosie the task of translating one of Di Di's poems to English for her to perform at the end of the festival. As Rosie talks to Di Di, she learns that Di Di is a political exile who was in the United Kingdom at the time of the Beijing massacre and has refused to return to China. Discouraged with her own poetry lacks depth, Di Di tells Rosie to make his poem into her own as she translates it.
Early in the festival, Rosie reveals that her father Mehran was Iranian; she claims he abandoned her family when she was seven. As her visit in Iran goes on, she discovers more about her father from his friends and family. Rosie learns that Mehran came from a prominent family in Shiraz and originally trained in the United States to be a fighter pilot in the Iranian Air Force back when the Shah still ruled. When the Iranian Revolution occurred, Mehran's ties to the Shah led to him being forced out of the Air Force; he because a teacher of poetry and literature instead. However, the government reinstated him when they needed pilots for the Iran–Iraq War. As the war dragged on, Mehran grew so disillusioned that he deserted the Air Force, fleeing to Turkey. He met Caroline on a beach in Turkey; the couple married and settled in Canada. Despite the risks involved, Mehran decided to return to Iran to see his dying mother, only to be arrested upon arrival and for his passport revoked. His departure deeply upset Caroline, which caused her to drive carelessly and resulted in a fatal car accident. When Mehran was finally released, he asked for Rosie to be sent to live with him in Iran. Grief-striken from the loss of Caroline, Rosie's grandparents refused, moving to Vancouver and cutting off all contact with Mehran, and lying to Rosie that her father abandoned her.
Near the time of her presentation, Rosie learns that Mehran is in the hospital with pneumonia. By the time Rosie reaches the hospital Mehran has already checked out, but she is given her father's home address by one of his friends who is a doctor at the hospital. Rosie meets her relatives from her father's side, who welcome her into the family and show her all the letters that Mehran wrote to her but her grandparents returned. When Rosie learns that her father is responsible for inviting her to Iran and is waiting for her at the festival, Rosie's relatives replace chador with a head scarf and a more casual outfit and rush to the presentation. As she recites her version of Di Di's poem, Mehran appears in the audience and finally reunites with his daughter."

She drops the knife and walks outside, back to the tow truck. As they are driving next to the ocean, she demands the tow truck driver pull over. She descends over rocks to the beach, walks into the ocean and submerges under water, reawakening in her boat on the mangrove swamp of the film's opening, revealing that the opening sequence is actually a reference to the final one where her murdered goat has gone and where she has now ""swum"" to."

The Breadwinner,"Parvana is a young girl living in Kabul, Afghanistan, under control of Taliban. Her father Nurullah, who is a teacher handicapped during The Soviet–Afghan War and turned a hawker, is unjustly arrested after a volatile young member of the Taliban, Idrees, thinks he insulted him while the two are selling goods in the market in Kabul. Parvana's family is left without an adult male relative, as her elder brother Sulayman died years ago, leaving her, her mother Fattema, her sister Soraya and her baby brother Zaki without means to support the family, as they are not allowed to go out without a male relative. After Parvana unsuccessfully tries to procure food while going out as a girl, she decides to dress as a boy and pretend to be Nurullah's nephew, ""Aatish,"" in order to support the family. Parvana frequently entertains Zaki by telling the story of a young man on a journey to retrieve the seeds stolen by the evil Elephant King.
The ploy works, and Parvana is able to get food and money. On the advice of Shauzia, another young girl dressing as a boy to support her family, Parvana goes to the prison where her father is held to try to bribe the guards into letting her see him. The plan fails, and Parvana is driven away. She works to save money to get a larger bribe, taking on hard labor jobs with Shauzia, who is trying to save enough money to escape her abusive father. Meanwhile, Fattema is forced to write to a relative in Mazar-i-Sharif, offering Soraya up for marriage in exchange for shelter and protection.

He befriends her and continues to meet with her so that she can teach him to read and write.

When Parvana returns home, Fattema pleads with her to stop the dangerous ploy, telling her that her relatives accepted Soraya and that they will be collected the day after next. Parvana agrees on the condition that she visits Nurullah in prison to inform him where they will be living, as Razaq has a cousin that lives there that will let her in. She tearfully bids farewell to Shauzia, promising that they will meet 20 years from then. However, as Parvana travels to the prison, Fattema's cousin arrives early and forces them to come with him without Parvana, as the war is starting and the roads will soon be blocked.

After Parvana reveals that she is Nurullah's daughter, Razaq informs her that his cousin has left to fight, but he will retrieve Nurullah; the prison is being cleared out of weak prisoners unable to fight, and Parvana witnesses their execution. A terrified Parvana gathers her courage to stay by finishing the tale of the boy, who she turns into Sulayman, revealing that he died after picking up a ""toy"" in the street, which was actually a land mine that exploded.

Goon: Last of the Enforcers,"During a pro hockey lockout, Doug ""The Thug"" Glatt's (Seann William Scott) team, the Halifax Highlanders, has to contend with an influx of new players. With pro hockey suspended, media focus has descended on the lower league, and the owner of the Highlanders, Hyrum Cain (Callum Keith Rennie), seeks to capitalize on the attention. Before the opening game, Doug is made captain and leads his team out onto the ice. In a close fought game, Doug is goaded into a fight with the rival team's enforcer, Anders Cain (Wyatt Russell), an up-and-coming player with a violent streak, and the son of the Highlanders' owner. Anders wins the fight, and with Doug badly injured, the Highlanders lose the game. Dealing with rehab, Doug decides to retire and accept a more stable job as an insurance salesman. At home, Doug's wife Eva realizes that she is pregnant, and she and Doug make preparations for their new child. Without Doug, the Highlanders go on a long losing streak, prompting the owner to push for changes. He signs several overseas players and pushes to add his own son to the team. Hyrum foresees Anders as the new captain of the Highlanders, and although the coach disagrees with the move, anticipating locker room dysfunction, Hyrum strongarms him into making Anders the new captain.
Meanwhile, Doug finds no joy in his new job, stuck in a dingy office, and he begins secretly training to get back into hockey. Doug visits his old rival, Ross ""The Boss"" Rhea, who has left hockey and now competes in a hockey fighting league, where he is the current champion. Doug convinces Ross to train him in southpaw fighting, as the injury he suffered fighting Anders has weakened his right arm. Ross agrees to train him, and Doug slowly begins to learn how to fight left-handed. Ross convinces Doug that if he joins the hockey fighting league and impresses, it could be a way to get back into minor league hockey. Doug takes Ross' advice, but the first fight ends up being a battle royale style brawl, instead of the one-on-one fights that Doug had witnessed before. Doug and Ross end up as the last two standing during the melee, but Ross is too hurt to continue and collapses before they can fight each other. In the locker room after the fight, Ross reveals that he has post-concussion syndrome, and doctors have recommended that he stop playing, as one more bad hit could cause a permanent injury.
At the same time, the Highlanders have improved with Anders as the captain, but not enough to get into playoff position. Anders' self-sabotaging play, in which he constantly is being penalized for fighting, has kept the Highlanders outside of a playoff spot. In addition, Anders' aggressive and violent attitudes towards his fellow players keeps the whole team on edge, and their play suffers as a result. During another losing effort, Anders grows frustrated and ends up knocking out the entire opposing team. He is promptly suspended, and the coach demands a change. Hyrum, having seen Doug at the hockey fighting league, suggests that they add Doug back to the roster, secretly hoping that his addition will push his son to play better. Before Doug's first game back, Eva makes Doug promise that he won't fight, concerned for him now that they're about to be parents. Doug reluctantly agrees, and the Highlanders narrowly win in Doug's celebrated return. The Highlanders go on a winning streak, but when Anders returns from suspension, he goads Doug into being more aggressive. Doug and Anders interrupt a game during a dispute, and they are both suspended for the next game. During the game's afterparty, Anders provokes Doug into a fight, and when Eva sees that Doug has been fighting again, she kicks him out of the house.
Meanwhile, the Highlanders must win the last two games of the season to sneak into the playoffs. With Anders and Doug suspended, Hyrum decides to sign Ross, who has still been competing in the local hockey fighting league. To free up a spot, Hyrum terminates Anders' contract, fed up with his son's antics. While Ross helps the Highlanders to win the first of their last two games, Eva goes into labor, and Doug reconciles with her as they head to the hospital. After having her baby, Eva realizes that the same drive that led Doug to be with her during the birth, is the same drive that pushes him to want to defend his teammates on the ice, and she gives Doug her blessing to continue fighting. Having been kicked off the team, Anders rejoins his old team, as they will play the Highlanders in the last game of the season with a playoff spot on the line. The game is immediately chippy, with both Ross and Anders starting fights. As the game enters the third period with the game tied, Ross and Anders are involved in a scuffle, and Anders cheap shots Ross, checking him from behind into the boards. Ross is knocked unconscious, and while paramedics take him away on a stretcher, Doug enters the rink to fight Anders in retaliation.
Doug uses his southpaw training to beat Anders, but when Doug shows mercy, Anders threatens Doug, claiming that he will never stop coming for him until they are both like Ross, being carried out on stretchers. Realizing that his new family is more important to him than hockey, Doug uses his weakened right arm to level Anders, but throws his arm out and has to be helped off the ice. Hyrum rushes to his son's aid, where Anders tells him that he hates hockey, and the two appear to mend things between them. Having been told earlier that further injury to his right arm would be career-ending, Doug realizes that his hockey days are behind him. He watches as the Highlanders win the game in the final seconds, and during the celebration, he sets his stick down and goes home."
"Hochelaga, Land of Souls (Hochelaga terre des âmes)","One night on the campus of McGill University, a rainstorm opens a sinkhole in the field during a game at Percival Molson Memorial Stadium, killing one player. Observing the development, archaeologist Antoine Morin theorizes the sinkhole may lead to evidence of Hochelaga, where French explorer Jacques Cartier contacted Indigenous peoples in Quebec. Morin hires Baptiste, a graduate student studying Mohawk history, to lead an archaeological excavation of the field.
The study brings to light that the site was the scene of a hard-fought battle between Indigenous warriors in 1267, when many Iroquoians were killed. Jacques Cartier arrives in 1535, claiming the land for the Kingdom of France. The territory subsequently sees an outbreak of fever in 1687. During the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1837, two French Canadian Patriote rebels seek sanctuary with the lady Sarah Walker, who attempts to guard them against British Colonel Philip Thomas."
Indian Horse,"The Indian Horse family, including six-year-old Saul and his older brother, retreat into their ancestral land to avoid the authorities after Saul's older brother is left ill by his time in an Indian residential school. Saul resolves never to go to a school, but his parents, converted to Christianity, are determined their eldest son will assimilate into the faith, and takes him away, leaving Saul with his grandmother. When his grandmother dies, Saul is discovered by the authorities and forcibly moved to a residential school. There, he meets Lonnie, who cannot speak English. Father Quinney and his nun deem Lonnie an unsuitable name and call him Aaron, and forbid the use of their Ojibwe language, beating Lonnie when he cannot comply.
In the school, Saul witnesses the nun and instructors abuse the children, and struggles to endure. One instructor, Father Gaston, looks for change and convinces Father Quinney to provide an outdoor activity, ice hockey. Saul does not meet the age requirement to play, but convinces Father Gaston to give him the job of maintaining the rink, which allows him to spend time on the ice. From televised hockey games, he also begins learning techniques. When one of the school's players is injured, Saul steps forward as a substitute and astounds Father Gaston with his demonstrated talent. Saul also declines to join Lonnie's escape attempt; Lonnie is recaptured and punished.
The school gives up Saul to a foster home in a mining town, where he can further pursue hockey. Saul joins an all-Indigenous team called the Moose, who travel to games between Indian reserves, and receives the jersey number 13, ""for luck"". Winning a key game, Saul is treated as a star player in Hockey Night in Canada style, but the team faces racial discrimination afterwards in a pub.
Saul attracts the notice of the Toronto Maple Leafs, but does not want to leave his friends in the Moose. He team insists he take the offer, and he reluctantly joins the Leafs. There, he keeps his number 13, which no one else wants due to Triskaidekaphobia. Initially excelling, he is nevertheless put off by a racist caricature of him in the newspaper, and stunned when Father Gaston appears, professing pride in where hockey has taken Saul, and admitting the abuses in the school were wrong. On the ice, Saul becomes the target of racist slurs from opponents and teammates alike, while the audience throws toy Indians onto the ice. Pushed into violence, he is confined to the penalty box and leaves the team. Taking odd low-level jobs, he drifts from place to place between 1979 and 1989. He sees Lonnie in an alley, suffering alcoholism. Facing his own health issues after severe damage to his liver, Saul is accepted by the rehabilitation centre Rising Dawn, where a group therapy leader encourages him to confront the root of his suffering. He travels back to the now closed school, where it is revealed that he had been sexually abused by Father Gaston. He makes a pilgrimage back to his ancestral lands, and then returns to his foster family, where he is happily welcomed by his foster family and former Moose teammates."

Armed with rifles, Soissons and Frère forbid anyone from entering their property. Soissons has raised Alice as a boy, cutting her hair short and breast binding her, and tells her she is a boy whose penis fell off when she was small. Soissons also tells his children he created them out of clay. As Alice has doubts as to these stories, Frère finds her outside of the house reading a book, memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon, that Soissons has banned, and rapes her.

As she rides the horse, she feels sexually stimulated, until she comes across a church in congregation. Drawn in my the music, she leads her horse into the building, where the attendees and priest react with shock and anger.

Ravenous (Les Affamés),"In the aftermath of a zombie-like outbreak, the rural regions of Quebec are decimated with few survivors remaining. Bonin and his friend Vézina patrol with shotguns, shooting the infected while amusing each other with doctor jokes. While out, Vézina is drawn out into the forest, surrounded, and attacked. Another survivor, wife and mother Céline, drives, alone, and kills the infected as she finds them with a machete. Céline wanders onto the property of two elderly, armed women, Therese and Pauline, who tell Céline to strip so they can see if she has been bitten. Upon seeing Céline is clean, they take her in.
Bonin meets Tania, a young woman with a bite mark, who swears she was bitten by a dog and not an infected. While Tania is initially tied down for safety reasons, Bonin unties her and drives her away as the infected close in. They pick up a little girl, Zoé. Bonin also spots infected in a field and spies on them. He observes that they are gathered around a stack of found objects they have assembled, in a mysterious ritual.
Bonin, Zoé, and Tania head back to Therese and Pauline's house, as Bonin knows them. Together, the group realizes the house is on the path of the infected invasion. As the infected swarm in, the group flees. They encounter two other survivors, the elderly former insurance agent Réal and the young Remi, who is armed with a rifle. The group unites and finds a cabin. Inside, they find a note from an anonymous survivor warning anyone who reads it to stay away from town and stating the author is looking for survivors on Quebec Route 113. Pauline is bitten and shot by Therese. Réal, having been bitten earlier, turns, bites Remi, and is dispatched by Céline, who also kills Remi before he can turn.
The advancing infected overrun the remaining survivors. Therese stays behind so Bonin can escape with Zoé and is killed. Surrounded, Céline begins hacking against the oncoming undead. Bonin gives Zoé to Tania and leads the infected away, as Tania hides Zoé in a tunnel and tells her Zoé is the strongest. Tania disappears as the infected continue to swarm. When Zoé emerges, she finds Bonin pointing his shotgun at his own head. Bonin tells her to go look for Tania, and Zoé sets off alone for Route 113, passing another infected-made structure. On the road, she is picked up by another survivor.
In a post-credits scene, the newly zombified Bonin and Tania stand in front of a tower of stacked chairs."

Lost in the Pacific,"The year is 2020, two armed soldiers pass through the dark forest of Fortune Island, a seemingly deserted island in the middle of the Pacific. Suddenly, something in the darkness catches their attention, they scream in terror On the other side of earth, the owner of Ocean Airlines, Mr. Gary Gao, launches the maiden voyage of his luxurious new passenger aircraft, the state-of-the-art, A390. The trip begins in Rio and much fanfare will await the aircraft's arrival in Hong Kong. The VIP guests on board include billionaire Prince Khadsa of Saudi Arabia, famed pop singer Colin, award-winning Hong Kong actress Lily Young, retired American sports star Rodman, renowned journalist, Mia Ren and her cameraman, Bob, of International News Web, celebrated Sichuan chef Mr. Liu, and the acclaimed blind cellist Kim Woo Nam.
Unbeknownst to all but himself, Gary and Ocean Airlines are in dire straits financially and Gary intends to confirm Prince Khadsa's proposed investment during the flight to save the company. Soon after takeoff it is learned that Chef Liu became ill and could not make the flight. Chef Liu has sent Mike, a handsome American, to replace him. As a Sichuanese, Ruoxin, the beautiful and decisive Co-Captain, doubts if this clumsy westerner can make proper Sichuan food, so she keeps finding fault with him. While everybody is enjoying the many amenities of the luxury flight, the aircraft passes through a major thunderstorm over the Pacific and gets struck by lightning. The crew, fearing the plane has been damaged, wants to land somewhere as soon as possible to inspect the aircraft. At first Gary, who wants to reach Hong Kong in record time, resists the crew's insistence on landing and tells them to push on at any cost. Eventually Gary decides to allow the crew to land the plane on the seemingly deserted Fortune Island, so they can see if there has been any irreparable damage. To avoid any notice of the emergency landing, Gary turns off the plane's location tracker.
Despite the tremendous storm, the crew successfully lands the A390 on the island. While the passengers have been ordered to stay on the plane, Ruoxin and Captain Jason Anderson go outside to inspect the engines. When they are about to return inside, Ruoxin discovers that journalist Mia Ren and her cameraman have secretly slipped out of the cabin and are now under attack from horrifically terrifying, unknown creatures. Suddenly, a multitude of black shadows jump out of the bush and kill Cpt. Jason and the cameraman. When Ruoxin and Mia Ren are about to be ripped to shreds by the creatures, gunshots are heard and they are momentarily saved. The bullets are from two armed soldiers moving swiftly in a jeep. The soldiers rescue the people on the ground and they all get on the plane together. The soldiers are Vincent Rigs and Nikki Lee. They claim to have been sent by the Army to eliminate the monsters that are inhabiting the island. When the A390's radio communications system is discovered to be badly damaged, Vincent suggests re-routing the flight to an Army coordination point in the Pacific.
It turns out that chef Mike was a formerly Special Ops and he recognizes that Vincent and Nikki are not who they say they are. He doubts the validity of the coordination points, but neither Ruoxin nor Gary believes him. In the meantime, a series of dreadful events happen, one after another. First, Peter is killed for discovering Vincents true identity, then Lily Young and an air hostess are killed by one of the creatures that has managed to get on the plane. Facing the panic and the rebellion from the now-convinced Ruoxin and Mike, Vincent and Nikki reveal their true purpose, proceed to hijack the plane, and take everyone onboard hostage. The so-called destination is a retired Nimitz aircraft carrier. After several tries Ruoxin dramatically lands the plane on the carrier, clipping the wing as she does so. Most of the survivors reach the deck, while the broken A390 slides off the carrier and sinks into the ocean.
Vincent asks Nikki to watch the hostages, while he goes below deck to find Dr. Han who has promised him $10 Million for a soil sample from the cave that the creatures inhabit. The fact that there seems to be no other people on the carrier makes Vincent nervous. Vincent finds Han who tells him that the experiment went out of control and the creatures had mutated, killed everyone else on the carrier, and were now reproducing. Dr. Han reveals to Vincent that as a last ditch effort he has rigged the carrier's nuclear power engine to explode to destroy the experiment and the creatures. Vincent quickly realizes that he will need to stop the explosion from happening if he is to live and ever see the $10 Million. On his way to the engines he is stopped by Mike and after a heated fight, Vincent is dead.
Ruoxin successfully starts the ignition of a helicopter on the deck of the carrier. Mike makes his way back up to the deck and narrowly jumps onto the helicopter as it leaves the ground. As the helicopter flies far away from the carrier, a huge mushroom cloud arises from the horizon, the carrier, experiment, and creatures have been destroyed.
In mid-credit scenes, a mutated cat is shown to be hiding on the helicopter."
From Vegas to Macau III,"The film starts with the ending of From Vegas to Macau II where the cardshark Ken’s (Chow Yun Fat) lifelong lover-nemesis, Molly (Carina Lau), skydives without her parachute from her private jet. She now appears to be trapped inside some sort of laser bubble — unconscious, naked and horribly airbrushed — while her admirer, mad scientist Yik Tin Hang (Jacky Cheung) fumes about making Ken pay within his lair underneath Paradise Island, off the coast of Thailand. Over in Macau, Ken is busy having a meltdown over the wedding of the century of his daughter Rainbow (Kimmy Tong) to his godson Vincent (Shawn Yue). To help him snap out of it, his friend Mark (Nick Cheung) hypnotizes him into thinking Vincent is marrying his fat cousin. Things go very wrong when Michael (Andy Lau), the disciple of Ko Chun, phoned in with a warning to beware of Yik Tin Hang who has hired mercenaries to kill Ken. An explosion during the wedding causes both Rainbow and Vincent to fall into coma, while Ken and Mark are accused to have engulfed DOA’s illicit money. Enraged, Ken swears to seek vengeance and to pursue the mastermind who has entangled them in his evil plans.
Ken and Mark end up in prison, a convenient venue for them to play a card game using cigarettes as chips (so technically, it’s not gambling), but are then abruptly rescued from a criminal raid and take refuge in Michael’s home in Singapore. Michael’s spacious pad, whose open layout looks suspiciously like a sound stage, serves as a cost-effective location for a lengthy stretch, while a gaggle of characters drop in and out to deliver trite gags. These range from a mildly irritating demo of wonky weapons by an ammo expert (Law Kar-ying), to a criminally infantile cake-throwing match. Two romantic arcs unfold — one between Ken’s R2-D2 doppelganger robot, Stupido, and Michael’s femme-bot, Skinny; the other a love triangle involving Michael, Ko’s younger sister Ko Fei (Li Yuchun) and Mark.
When Yik Tin Hang finally arrives to exact revenge, he challenges Ken and his friends to a game of table tennis. He later invites them to a “charity” mahjong, dice and three-person card game from China (called ""Fighting the Landlord"") event at a hall within the island resort on Paradise Island. A host of cameos are trotted out, including Psy of ""Gangnam Style"" fame, who was then escorted out of the hall. After the games, sleeping gas is released into the hall, causing Ken and the guests to pass out.
Ken and his friends sneak into a warehouse under the hall, where they battle Yik Tin Hang's mercenaries and four robots. Stupido and Skinny, who fly all the way to the resort, save them and defeat the robots, but are heavily damaged in the process. Michael encounters nine tough androids, who attack him, but he tricks them, and Only Yu arrives with Interpol officers, pressing a large button that forces the androids to dance and then self-destruct. Ken confronts Yik Tin Hang in the latter's lair, and Yik Tin Hang electrocutes him with a baton and a gauntlet on his right arm, destroying his laboratory in the process. Molly awakens from her laser bubble and calls Yik Tin Hang, allowing Ken to defeat Yik Tin Hang. As she dies in Ken's arms, Yik Tin Hang watches and dies as well.
At the end of the movie, Ken and his friends celebrate Chinese New Year in Michael's house. Stupido and Skinny, who had been repaired, are brought with their robotic offspring to Ken's celebration."
The Mermaid,"Playboy business tycoon Liu Xuan (刘轩, played by Deng Chao) purchases the Green Gulf, a wildlife reserve, for a sea reclamation project, and uses sonar technology to get rid of the sea life in the area. Unknown to him, the Green Gulf is the home of merpeople and the sonar (in addition to heavy pollution) has caused many of them to die or get sick. The few survivors live in an abandoned shipwreck in the gulf, and want to assassinate Xuan for his deeds. The merfolk send Shan (珊, played by Lin Yun), a beautiful young mermaid, who has been trained to walk and dance on her fins and hide among humans, to seduce and kill Xuan. At an extravagant party celebrating Xuan's success, Shan, pretending to be a dancer, gives him her telephone number and asks him to call her.
Xuan, believing that Shan is a prostitute, calls her number in order to make his female business partner, Ruolan, jealous. Shan tries to kill Xuan, but all her attempts backfire. In the end, Xuan decides to take Shan back home, and along the way Shan takes him to a funfair where she works. While there, Shan tries to show Xuan there are more important things than money, and Xuan is impressed with Shan's simple, amusing antics. They spend the day together and develop feelings for each other. When Xuan finally takes Shan home, Shan quickly sends Xuan away before her people can kill him. The next day, Xuan takes Shan for another date and proposes, saying that he is lonely. Xuan admits that even though they only met the day before, he already knows that she is the one for him. Shan, in a bit of shock and confusion, rejects him and admits that she was sent there to kill him. Xuan kisses her, but the kiss is interrupted by Ruolan. As Shan runs out, Ruolan stops Xuan from following her. Xuan gets angry and tells Ruolan to cancel their business deal.
That night, as Shan gets into an argument with the other merpeople, Xuan goes to Shan's house to talk to her. There, he discovers that she and her family are merpeople. Against Shan's wishes, the others capture Xuan and explain that he is killing them with his development project. Xuan is about to be killed when Shan helps him escape. Octopus, one of Shan's friend, gets mad and ask her if she has fallen in love with Xuan. She refuses to answer and goes on crying. Xuan returns home and, after the shock has worn off, decides to investigate the consequences of his project. He turns off the sonar but mistakenly tells Ruolan that Shan is a mermaid and reveals where the other merpeople live. Ruolan tells Xuan that George, her henchman, also believes in mermaids and has been trying to find one. She also gets angry at Xuan for not returning her affections and vows to kill Shan. Xuan tries to stop them but they dismiss him and proceed to the abandoned ship. The merpeople are attacked by Ruolan's mercenaries, and many of them are killed. Soon enough, the merpeople realize that the sonar had been turned off and return to the ocean. Shan gets shot and chased as she tries to escape them. Xuan, using a jetpack, arrives in time to retrieve a badly-injured Shan. As he is carrying her to the ocean, Ruolan angrily shoots him three times. George stops her before she could shoot him again. Shan insists that Xuan leave her, but he continues to carry her to safety. While Ruolan and George get arrested, Xuan collapses from his wounds.
Three years later, a student arrives at Xuan's home to thank him for setting up a scholarship for research into environmental protection. The student asks Xuan whether merpeople are real and if the story that he fell in love with a mermaid is true, but Xuan denies it. Xuan then introduces the student to his wife, ""Lucy"", who is actually Shan in a human disguise. Xuan tells the student to not believe in fairytales and myths. The screen then goes to Xuan and Shan swimming in the ocean along with the other merpeople."
The Monkey King 2,"500 years after Sun Wukong's (Aaron Kwok) imprisonment under the Five Fingers Mountain, a young Buddhist monk Tang Sanzang (Feng Shaofeng) sets out for a journey to the Thunder Monastery in India to collect Buddha's scriptures. When he is attacked by a tiger, he is forced to free Wukong and the Monkey King learns that he has to protect the monk throughout the journey, because the Bodhisattva Guanyin ensured he would be bound by an enchanted circlet that can cause him pain whenever Tang Sanzang chants a certain sutra. Soon the duo meet Zhu Bajie (Xiaoshenyang), a lustful pig demon, and Sha Wujing (Him Law), a djinn-like monk.
The company travel to the Yun Hai Xi Kingdom, a land terrorized by the White Bone Demon (Gong Li) who has been eating people in order to extend her unnatural life and avoid the Wheel of Reincarnation. As the demoness learns about Sanzang, she decides to eat him in order to stop her reincarnation cycle and achieve everlasting demonhood. She takes the appearance of an old woman and lures the group into a cottage in the woods. To prevent Wukong from using his truth-seeking eyes to see through her disguise immediately, she throws tainted dust into his eyes that clouds his sight. Then while her disguised minions keep Wukong, Bajie and Wujing occupied, the demoness tells Sanzang a story about how she was forced to marry as a young girl, and when her village suffered famine, the people blamed her for it, even calling her an evil demon, and attempted to kill her as a sacrifice to the gods. As Tang comforts the old lady, she attempts to kill him, but is stopped by Wukong. The demoness escapes before Wukong can deal the killing blow and leaves the dead body of the old lady behind. Sanzang and the others don't believe Wukong that all the women he murdered were demons, and blame him for killing the innocent. Sanzang punishes Wukong by chanting the sutra and causing the circlet to tighten painfully on his head. Afterwards, Sanzang climbs to the top of a mountain where Wukong is sulking. Sanzang tells Wukong he thinks they are both very alike, for they both only trust what their own eyes sees. But together, they are better able to discern the truth. This is why they were all chosen to be on this journey together.
The group arrives to the kingdom's capital and the King (Fei Xiang) throws a feast for them, begging Sanzang to exorcise the bloodthirsty demoness from their land. Suddenly Lady White appears and demands the monk, but he offers her his help in enlightenment instead. She tells Wukong that they are both very alike, and tries to persuade Wukong to let her devour the monk, but he deceives her instead and a fight ensues. During the chaos, the King's guards kidnap Sanzang. It is revealed that it's been actually the King kidnapping and killing the children in a desperate attempt to cure himself of a cursed disease by drinking their blood. He tries to kill Sanzang, but Wukong arrives and saves the monk and the surviving children as well. All of the group are celebrated as heroes, but as a little girl approaches Sanzang, Wukong beats her and her mother to death as well, because his truth-seeking eyes perceive both were possessed by the White Bone Demon. In a fit of anger and disbelief, Tang banishes Wukong away. As soon as Wukong leaves, Sanzang gets kidnapped by the demoness.
In the demoness' lair, The White Bone Demon gives Sanzang a day to convince her to give up her evil ways and embrace nonviolence and enlightenment as the true path to immortality. She reveals to him the story she had told him earlier was true, recounting her previous life as a mortal. Right before Sanzang's time is up, he is saved by Wukong at the last minute. Wukong, Baije and Wujing fight the White Bone Demon and her army and finally defeat her, with Wukong mortally wounding her. The Buddha comes down from the Heavens to collect the defeated demoness' soul and banish it to oblivion but Sanzang pleads Buddha to grant her mercy and give Sanzang one last chance to save her soul from destruction. Buddha tells him that he would have to lead her on the path herself, meaning he would have to sacrifice his own life. The monk begs the demoness to show remorse and accept the Wheel of Reincarnation, but the White Bone Demon would rather die as a broken tainted soul in Sanzang's body instead of returning to the Wheel of Reincarnation. Saddened, Tang begs Wukong to kill him, too. The Monkey King refuses at first, but Sanzang explains how he used to think he just had to recite Buddha's teachings to convince people to become good. Now he understands he must also lead by example and do good in order to convince people. Sanzang had to do this for his own journey towards enlightenment. Wukong finally understands the monk's desire to help the demoness change her fate, and tearfully agrees, promising Sanzang to wait for his return. Wukong brings his staff down and Sanzang's body is changed into a statue. In return Sanzang says if he gets a chance to do so in his next life, he would be glad to be Wukong's master again. Because of Sanzang's sacrifice, he succeeds in leading the demoness to her next reincarnation, freeing her of her pain and hatred.
Some time later, Wukong and his friends still wait for the return of the monk, but continue their journey to the Thunder Monastery. Wukong rides on Sanzang's horse with Sanzang's statue strapped to his back. From Heaven, Guanyin drops a bead of water from her magic vase that falls to earth and hits right at Sanzang's hand. The surface cracks, revealing a human finger underneath."

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny","After eighteen years of solitude, renowned warrior-maiden Shu Lien emerges from retirement and travels to Peking, where the Green Destiny—the legendary sword of her deceased love Li Mu Bai—is located. In the forest, Shu Lien's carriage is attacked by several warriors from the West Lotus clan. As she fights them, a masked horseman comes to her aid, and together they defeat the attackers, revealing one's identity to be a young man called Wei Fang.
At the tower of the West Lotus warlord Hades Dai, a young woman named Snow Vase arrives asking to join his ranks. As Dai approaches, she draws a sword and attempts to kill him, although he easily fights her off, and she flees. As Wei Fang makes his way through the forest, he is approached by a blind enchantress, who orders him to take her to Dai. She tells Dai that his great sword is surpassed by the Green Destiny, and prophesies that if he is to rule the Martial World, he must obtain the sword. Dai is reluctant to storm the home of the emperor's brother, but the enchantress tells him to send Wei Fang, as the boy and the sword are bound by destiny itself.
Shu Lien arrives in Peking, and is taken to the house of Sir Te, a man like a father to her, who has recently died. Te's son greets her and reveals that the Green Destiny is kept on display at the house, also recalling the unmentioned love between Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien. That night as Wei Fang breaks into the house and attempts to steal the sword, Snow Vase appears and fights him. During the fight, Snow Vase sees a birthmark on Wei Fang's chest, which distracts her and allows him to escape. She calls for help and Shu Lien arrives and captures the boy. Snow Vase approaches Shu Lien and asks her to train her in the Iron Way.
At a tavern, Meng Sizhao (known as Silent Wolf in the West), the horseman who came to Shu Lien's aid, posts a warrant for warriors to join him protecting the House of Te. One warrior offers his twenty swordsmen for a high price, and attacks when rebuffed. Four warriors join Silent Wolf in the fight, and he recruits them to his cause: Flying Blade of Shantung; Thunder Fist Chan, famed in Zhejiang; Silver Dart Shi, famed in Fuzhou; and Turtle Ma, famed in that tavern.
Shu Lien begins Snow Vase's training. That night, Silent Wolf and his warriors arrive at the Te compound. Shu Lien is shocked to see Silent Wolf, her former betrothed, as he was thought to have been killed by Hades Dai many years before. He explains that he was in love with Shu Lien, but knew that Mu Bai was her true love, and had feigned his demise to seek a life of enlightenment in the mountains, as he knew that as long as he was alive, Li Mu Bai would not have asked Shu Lien for her hand.
Hades Dai rages that Wei Fang has failed in his raid, and sends his elite warrior, Mantis, to retrieve the sword. She arrives with her raiding party, and Silver Dart Shi and Turtle Ma are killed in the attack. Snow Vase attempts to free Wei Fang from his cage in the courtyard, but she is attacked by Mantis, and Wei Fang reveals the sword's location. The blind enchantress fights Shu Lien in the sword chamber, killing Sir Te's son when Shu Lien refuses to relinquish the sword.
As the inhabitants of the House of Te mourn the loss of their dearest companions, Snow Vase explains her connection to Wei Fang's past. His birth mother was the legendary swordswoman Han Mei. However, as a baby, he was swapped for the infant Snow Vase by her mother, a concubine. Han Mei raised Snow Vase as her own daughter, but never stopped looking for her son. Eventually finding him at West Lotus, she was mortally wounded by Hades Dai and, as she died, implored Snow Vase to find Wei Fang.
Knowing that Dai will send people to kill Wei Fang, Snow Vase frees him, and is horrified to later hear that he has stolen the sword. Silent Wolf tracks the boy down and they fight on a frozen lake. Wei Fang's master, Iron Crow, arrives and wounds Silent Wolf, allowing Wei Fang to escape and reach West Lotus. Wei Fang offers the sword to Hades Dai, but then attempts to kill him with it to avenge his mother. Shu Lien and the others arrive and fight Dai's army. Shu Lien fights the enchantress and kills her, using her skills to see through the witch's illusions. Mantis kills Flying Blade and Thunder Fist, then fights Snow Vase, who defeats her but is badly wounded. Silent Wolf fights Hades Dai on the tower, eventually killing the warlord with his own sword as he reaches for the Green Destiny.
Snow Vase survives her injuries, and joins Shu Lien, Silent Wolf and Wei Fang as they take the Green Destiny to the Wudang Mountains where it will be kept safe yet again."
The Bodyguard,"The film is set in the 2000s in a medium-sized Chinese city located in northeast China, close to the Russian border. An old, overweight man named Ding witnesses a man being stabbed by a gang, but when he is summoned by the police to identify the suspect, he hesitates and is unable to. The police research Ding's background and discover that he is a retired Central Security Bureau officer from Beijing, and they figure that he is suffering from dementia. Back at his home, Ding is frequently invited for supper by his land-lord, Park, an elderly lady who is attracted to him. Ding, in turn, frequently cares for a little girl next door named Cherry, whose father, Li, is an abusive gambler.
When Li becomes heavily in debt because of his gambling, Choi, a Chinese person of Korean descent, who happens to be the leader of the aforementioned gang, forces Li to embark on a criminal assignment. Li is driven to a hotel and told to steal the shoulder-bag of a Russian gang leader. The alarm is raised but Li escapes with the bag after a protracted chase. However, upon being told that his debt isn't absolved, Li goes into hiding, taking the bag with him. Choi reacts by sending men to abduct Li's daughter. Meanwhile, the Russian gang leader feels angry and plans an attack against Choi's gang for violating their territory.
Choi's gang members follow Cherry and assault Ding's home after she enters it, but to their dismay, Ding proves to be a remarkable fighter, and they are repelled. To avoid arrest, two of them are sent by Choi to hide in the countryside. The police, noticing that Li has disappeared, send Cherry to live with her aunt and uncle. However, within a short time, the aunt and uncle wish to eject her, and Ding agrees to provide for her living. Then one night, Cherry goes missing, and what is more, Li suddenly appears in Ding's home, bringing money in order to compensate Ding for his service. As Li exits the house, he is assaulted by Choi's gang and killed, and the shoulder-bag is taken back.
Ding, who has been plagued with guilt for years, ever since his granddaughter went missing on a hiking trip, resolves to bring Cherry back using force. He visits the gambling house demanding Cherry's release, and when Choi's gang attempts to kill him, he overpowers around 20 of them including a skilled knife assassin. At that moment, some of the Russian gang members appear and start to kill the rest of Choi's men in an attempt to reclaim their stolen money. Seeing this, Choi escapes, but not before Ding wounds his leg. The Russians proceed to attack Ding, believing that he works for Choi, and Ding is forced to kill them. At the same time, the police, led by Park's son, chase after two leaders of the Russian gang, who die when they collide with a truck. Choi, who thinks he is safe, is approached by the two subordinates he sent into the countryside. They proceed to murder Choi and to rob him, having accepted a Russian bribe to do so.
In the aftermath of the incident, Ding's dementia worsens, and he is paralyzed by the loss of Cherry. The police make no attempt to blame Ding, recognizing that his actions were self-defense. Suddenly, Cherry returns, revealing that she simply ran off to live at a friend's house. Even as Ding forgets his family members, he remembers his relationship with Cherry, who cares for him well into his senescence. In a scene after the credits, the two countryside criminals accidentally encounter a group of drilling PLA military-police, who turn and give chase. After a short chase the remaining criminals are captured."

Big Fish & Begonia,"In a mystical realm that exists beneath the human world, populated by magical-powered beings, a girl named Chun participates in a coming-of-age ritual where she is transported through a portal of water to experience the human world in the form of a red dolphin. There, she encounters a human boy who lives by the sea and reveres aquatic creatures. During a storm, Chun is tangled in a fishing net near the boy's house, and the boy drowns while freeing her from the net. Chun returns to her world, taking the boy's ocarina with her.
Chun bargains with the soul keeper, a resident of her world who collects virtuous departed souls from the human world, to return the boy to life. The soul keeper takes half of her lifespan in exchange for giving her the boy's soul, which has manifested in this world in the form of a baby dolphin. He advises her that she must nurture the dolphin to adulthood in order to return the boy's soul to the human world. Qiu, Chun's childhood friend, discovers her undertaking; since beings from the human world are forbidden, he promises to help her keep her task secret. Together, they name the dolphin Kun, after a massive fish of legend.
Chun's mother soon finds Kun and throws him into the sewer. While searching for Kun, Chun and Qiu meet the rat matron, who collects the souls of sinners from the human world, which manifest in the form of rats. She takes an interest in the dolphin from the human world, and summons her rats to recover him from the sewer. Chun and Qiu managed to escape from the rats taking Kun with them.
When Qiu is bitten by a two-headed snake, Chun's grandfather draws the venom into his own body to save Qiu's life. Before succumbing to the venom, he confides in her that he will support her in her task even in death. After his passing, his soul manifests in the form of a begonia tree.
As Chun's world begins to experience unnatural torrential rains and snowfall, her family and the local elders realize that Kun's continued presence has caused these phenomena. One night, after Chun confesses to Qiu that she traded away half her lifespan, Qiu receives a warning from the rat matron to hide Kun. He puts Kun in a frozen lake in order to save Chun from further persecution, but Chun dives in after Kun. The rat matron summons her rats to recover Chun and Kun from the icy water, and takes the ocarina from Chun, planning to use it to secure her own passage to the human world.
As Chun continues to watch over Kun, Qiu visits the soul keeper to bargain his own life for the return of Chun's. The soul keeper demands his entire lifespan as payment, while warning that Chun will still die regardless when Kun returns to the human world. The soul keeper reveals to Qiu how to save Chun from this fate.
The residents of Chun's world gather to kill Kun and avert further calamity. Qiu arrives and performs the ritual to open a portal to the human world, but Kun is unable to swim through it, while the rat matron arrives and uses the ocarina to pass through the portal. Holes in the sky begin to open uncontrollably, flooding Chun's world with sea water from the human world.
Chun is reminded that her actions to save Kun are dooming the people of her own world; she tries to help them evacuate from the flood, but is spurned by all, including her mother. As a last resort, Chun sacrifices herself, merging her body with her grandfather's begonia tree to grow it to colossal proportions, plugging the holes in the sky and saving everyone from the flood.
Kun breaks a branch off the begonia tree and brings to the soul keeper who restores Chun to life from it. He sets her on a pilgrimage to return Kun to his world; along the way, they find Qiu, who joins them. Qiu asks her whether she would like to live in the human world herself, but, overwhelmed with regret in knowing they are spending their last night together, is unable to express his feelings for her.
The next day, Chun bids Kun farewell as Qiu opens one last portal for his return. At the same time, Qiu, following the soul keeper's instructions, casts a spell that will send Chun to the human world while killing him by setting him on magical fire. Chun is transformed into a red dolphin, allowing her to follow Kun through the portal.
On a seashore in the human world, Kun and Chun wash ashore in their human forms. Chun holds out her hand to Kun.
In a mid-credits scene, the soul keeper restores Qiu to life from his ashes, declaring that Qiu will be his successor."

Rock Dog,"Bodi (Luke Wilson) is a young Tibetan Mastiff who is expected to be the next guard of the village of Snow Mountain, succeeding his father Khampa (J. K. Simmons) after the latter has driven out a pack of gangster grey wolves led by the villainous Linnux (Lewis Black) years ago, but is sure they will return. Khampa has some of the local sheep dressed up as Mastiffs to give the illusion the village is being guarded by multiple Mastiffs to keep the wolves at bay, but Bodi has trouble perfecting his father's signature move the Iron Paw which projects a powerful blast that as Khampa states can only happen if Bodi ""finds the fire."" Khampa has also forbidden music in the village since Bodi got distracted from his duties when he was younger.
After a disastrous training session, Bodi accidentally and indirectly causes a nearby flying plane to drop a package. Among the items that fell out, Bodi becomes interested in a red radio and listens to some of the music on the stations before becoming entranced on rock music and idolizes British rock legend Angus Scattergood (Eddie Izzard). Bodi steals a traditional dramyin from a den of locked up instruments, adds additional strings to make it a conventional Western guitar, and begins neglecting his guard duties in favor of playing music, which puts him at odds with his father, especially since Bodi told him that he has decided to be a musician.
After Khampa and some of the guard sheep accidentally cause Bodi to unleash a false alarm on the village while dressed as wolves (in an attempt to scare him straight) escalating into some fireworks being set off, the village elder Fleetwood Yak (Sam Elliott) convinces Khampa to let Bodi follow his dream and gives him a bus ticket to give to Bodi that will take him to a nearby city. Khampa gives Bodi the ticket, but makes him promise to give up music if his trip doesn't work out; the villagers and Fleetwood say goodbye to him after he leaves with his guitar. At the bus station, Bodi is discovered by two of Linnux's henchman, the short and comical Riff (Kenan Thompson) and the tall and silent Skozz. Riff informs Linnux of Bodi's departure and Linnux orders them to kidnap Bodi, reasoning that Bodi is his chance to take over Snow Mountain.
When Bodi makes to the city, he heads to Rock and Roll Park since it's where Scattergood began his career. He attempts to join a band consisting of the down-to-earth fox Darma (Mae Whitman) and an absent-minded goat drummer named Germur (Jorge Garcia), who are the only members and therefore don't have an audience. However, Bodi is humiliated after losing a guitar contest to an arrogant snow leopard guitarist named Trey (Matt Dillon), who is amused with Bodi's naivety. Trey, discovering his idolization for Scattergood, manipulates Bodi into convincing Scattergood to give him some guitar lessons at his mansion, though he knows a little secret about Angus' security set-up. At Scattergood's mansion, he is revealed to be a white Persian cat who wears black sunglasses all the time and has a serious case of songwriter's block as his manager, Ian, has given him three days to unleash a new song or his career will go down. His only companion is his robot butler Ozzie.
When Bodi tries to meet Scattergood, the latter is put off by Bodi's fanboy attitude and tries to evade him. Eventually, Bodi and Scattergood get lost in a back alley and Bodi decides to play music at Rock and Roll Park to get money for Scattergood to get back to his mansion. However, Riff and Skozz mistakenly kidnap Scattergood after they see Bodi at the park just when Bodi tries to convince a disbelieving Darma and Germur that he is with Scattergood. After Riff and Skozz realize their mistake, Linnux angrily sends them off to find Bodi again and they drop Scattergood off at his home. After Scattergood thinks that his career is over since he has less than a day to write a new song, he hears Bodi playing on his guitar and decides to use Bodi to create a new song. He invites Bodi into his home with the facade of a ""guitar lesson"" and together they create a new song called ""Glorious"".
Bodi later realizes that he was used after hearing Scattergood take full credit for the song on a radio, which saddens him. Trey mocks Bodi and everyone in the park leaves, although Darma and Germur feel sorry for Bodi. Soon afterward, Bodi finally gets captured by Linnux's henchmen via tranquilizer darts and he accidentally - while slightly under the tranquilizer's effects - reveals the fake Mastiff guards when Linnux interrogates him for information. Linnux and his gang head off to Snow Mountain while Bodi is put into a boxing match at Linnux's Fight Club, but Bodi cleverly has his opponent break the cage surrounding them so he can escape.
Meanwhile, Scattergood, after being guilt-tripped by Ozzie for exploiting Bodi for his own self-serving goals (Ozzie only needed to be recharged), uses his old tour bus to find Bodi. At Rock and Roll Park, Scattergood meets up with Darma and Germur and they discover that Bodi has been captured when they see his guitar covered in tranquilizer darts. Scattergood, with a change of heart, forgoes sending in his new song to rescue Bodi. After meeting with Bodi outside of Linnux's hideout, Scattergood makes amends with him by giving his old acoustic guitar with his autograph as a sign of gratitude and then takes him to Snow Mountain to stop Linnux and his henchmen.
Linnux and his gang overpower Khampa and the whole village and attempt to devour the villagers, but Bodi appears. After a climatic chase, Bodi subdues the wolves by ""finding the fire"" by playing Scattergood's guitar and making the wolves, the villagers, and his friends levitate. Khampa banishes Linnux with his Iron Paw and accepts Bodi's ambition to play rock music.
At the city, Scattergood gives full credit of the song ""Glorious"" to Bodi. Bodi forms a band with Darma and Germur as they (including Scattergood, Fleetwood, and the sheeps) sing and play ""Glorious"" to the city, the Snow Mountain villagers, Khampa, and most of the redeemed wolves (including Riff and Skozz) at Linnux's old Fight Palace. Outside, Trey tries to convince a bear bouncer that he's a part of the band, but is rejected. Scattergood recommends Bodi's band to Ian as Bodi shows the audience his blue energy wave."

Leizhenzi volunteers to find the sword, and Jiang Ziya tells him that he must take three gifts from the Spring of Life with him. He also summons an egg from the well, out of which Ne Zha hatches and causes mischief. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha depart into a wasteland, where the first of Jiang Ziya's gifts, a one-eyed plant, gives Leizhenzi advice. Ne Zha plays with the plant, and the three are chased by an enormous centipede-like worm, which Leizhenzi kills. Ne Zha steals from Leizhenzi the second gift: a baby Dragon Prince whose growth was stunted by Ne Zha, and it subdues the quickly-grown Ne Zha (Wen Zhang) by breathing a gas on him, making him unconscious while turning him into an adult. Upon waking, Leizhenzi forces him to help him find the Sword of Light, while promising to him that he will help Ne Zha find his Fire Wheels.
Shen Gong Bao constructs and animates an automaton (Angelababy), and instructs her to find and kill Leizhenzi. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha stumble into a collection of pillars within a marsh, which turn into a palace in a desert, where a hermit (Huang Xiaoming) manipulates sand with magic.Irritated, the hermit attacks them, but is defeated. The hermit is revealed to be Erlang Shen. Leizhenji gives Erlang Shen the third of Jiang Ziya's gifts: his faithful dog Howling Celestial. Erlang Shen then leaves them to find his Golden Armor.
Leizhenzi and Ne Zha travel to a port, where the former encounters a beautiful woman who entertains children with glowing butterflies, whose name is Lan Die, in reality the automaton. Leizhenzi and Lan Die go find a sorceress Taiyi Zhenren, who uses his dreams to read into his mind. After being woken by the plant, Lan Die steals the artifact that they use as a ship to sail out of the port, and Ne Zha follows. That ship is supposed to sail to any location that its user desires. While in the ship, Ne Zha torments the baby Dragon Prince, who breathes gas on Ne Zha again to put him to sleep and reverting him back to a child. Lan Die and Leizhenzi admire the sunrise, but Shen Gong Bao takes her memories away, revealing her to be an automaton.
Leizhenzi wonders why is the ship going to the middle of the ocean, and the plant answers that it is because someone else, the baby dragon prince, has controlled the ship to return to his father's palace. As the Dragon Prince sings, the Dragon King of the East Sea (Waise Lee) hears him and orders his giant octopus to bring Ne Zha and his son back to him. While in the sea palace, Ne Zha demands the Dragon King to return his Fire Wheels to him. The Dragon King orders his guards to attack Ne Zha, but he defeats them by urinating and passing gas at them. The Dragon King gives Ne Zha the Fire Wheels, and is given the baby dragon prince in exchange. With the fire wheels, Ne Zha turns into an adult and flies away.
The ship is now able to fly to Leizhenzi's former home, which is now in ruins. He finds the Sword of Light, which is guarded by several rapidly-moving rings that surround its floating island. Shen Gong Bao arrives with a fleet of flying ships, and subdues Leizhenzi. In exchange for Leizhenzi's life, Lan Die overcomes the rapid rings, and retrieves the sword, but it inadvertently destroys the rings and blows Shen Gong Bao and his fleet away. Leizhenzi grows new wings and carries the dying Lan Die to see the sunset. She turns into a wooden mannequin, and he leaves her to rest at the sword's island, taking the sword with him. As he notices the suns beginning to converge, he hurries with Ne Zha and Erlang Shen (who has found his golden armor) back to the capital, which is now under siege by another fleet of King Zhou's flying ships. As Jiang Jiya struggles to use the city's defense system properly, Daji uses her magic again to revive Shen Gong Bao, which turns him into an invincible monster.
The three heroes return with the Sword of Light to find Jiang Ziya being reverted to a young boy. They fight Shen Gong Bao, who during the fight kills Ji Chang. With his dying breath, Ji Chang passes his command and the sword to his son, Ji Fa. Ji Fa rushes to the Spring of Life and dives in to charge the sword. As the heroes draw Shen Gong Bao into the Spring of Life, Ji Fa emerges as the ""Golden Dragon"" with his charged sword and new golden armor, and kills the monster.
The movie ends with Ji Fa mobilizing his forces for a counter attack and flies his fortress towards the Shang kingdom, while King Zhou turns into the Black Dragon awaiting for the heroes to attack, with a baby Jiang Ziya in their possession."

The monsters, one of whom William had slain, attack once every sixty years. The Order's commanders are stunned by the monster's severed hand, believing the invasion was still a week away. Suddenly, a large wave of monsters assault the Great Wall, and the Order is mobilized.
Both sides sustain heavy losses before the monsters' queen aborts the attack. During the battle, William and Tovar are freed by Ballard, a European who, like them, had ventured east twenty-five years ago in search of black powder, been detained, and now serves as an English and Latin teacher. William saves Peng Yong, a warrior, from the attacking monsters. William and Tovar's battle skills earn the Nameless Order's respect. William and Tovar meet with Ballard, plan to steal black powder, and flee while the Order is occupied in battle by the Tao Tieh.
During the night, two Tao Tieh reach the top of the Wall and kill several guards. Shao and Lin lead soldiers against them but are ambushed. The Tao Tieh are slain but Shao is killed, putting Lin in command of the Nameless Order. Around this time, an envoy from the capital Bianliang arrives with an ancient scroll which suggests that the monsters are pacified by magnets. Wang believes the stone William carries enabled him to slay the Tao Tieh he fought before entering the Wall. To test the hypothesis, William suggests they capture a Tao Tieh alive and agrees to help. This delays his escape plans, angering Tovar, who nevertheless postpones their plans to assist William over Ballard's protests.
During the next attack, the Tao Tieh are numerous enough to cause Lin to resort to using arrows equipped with black powder, whose capabilities had been kept secret from the Westerners until now. They capture a living Tao Tieh and prove the theory. The monster, however, is claimed and taken to the capital, Bianliang, by the Imperial envoy before it can be further studied. A short while later, a tunnel is discovered at the base of the Wall; the previous attacks had been a distraction, while the Tao Tieh dug a passage through the wall. While Lin investigates, Tovar and Ballard steal a supply of black powder and escape, knocking William unconscious after he tries to stop them.
William is arrested by the Chinese, and, though Peng Yong speaks up for him, is locked up in the Wall. Some distance away, Ballard betrays and abandons Tovar, but is captured by the Khitans, who accidentally kill themselves and Ballard after igniting the powder; the Chinese soldiers recapture Tovar. At the capital, the envoy presents the captive Tao Tieh to the Emperor, but it awakens and signals the Tao Tieh attack.
Rushing to protect the capital, Lin orders the use of hot-air balloons. Before setting out, Lin sets William free. Wang tells him to warn the outside world, but William boards the last balloon with Peng and Wang. They arrive just in time to save Lin from being devoured. They land in the Emperor's palace, where Wang proposes killing the queen by tying explosives to the captured Tao Tieh and giving it meat to be delivered. While transporting, a horde of Tao Tieh breach the sewers. Peng Yong sacrifices himself to save the others.
After releasing the Tao Tieh, Lin and William climb a tower for William to detonate the explosives via an arrow. Wang sacrifices himself to buy time for Lin and William to move to the upper floors. Two of William's arrows are deflected by the Tao Tieh queen's bodyguards, but William throws the magnet into the horde, creating a gap in the shields and allowing Lin's spear to get through. The queen is destroyed, and the rest of the horde is frozen solid. With the threat eliminated, William is allowed to return home and elects to take Tovar with him instead of the powder, much to Tovar's annoyance."

Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back,"The monk Tang Sanzang (Kris Wu) finds himself as a giant in a city in India. His master congratulates him on reaching India and retrieving the Sutras, and gives him a halo as a reward. The halo, however, malfunctions and Tang awakes from his dream to find himself in an alley in a village of circus performers with his three disciples: Sun Wukong (Lin Gengxin); Zhu Bajie (Yang Yiwei); and Sha Wujing (Mengke Bateer). Tang encourages Sun Wukong to perform for the villagers, but the disciple refuses. Angered by this stubbornness, Tang provokes Sun Wukong by calling him a ""bad monkey"", which causes Sun Wukong to smash the village and damage the villagers' homes in his temper. The terrified villagers present the group with money and food for their travels, but Sun Wukong continues wreaking havoc, sending Zhu Bajie and Tang flying through the air. That night, Tang whips Sun Wukong for his disobedience.
The next morning, Tang goes to find water for their breakfast congee and comes across a house. Its host, a beautiful woman in a splendid outfit (Wang Likun), welcomes them all in for breakfast with her companions. Sun Wukong, however, sees through their disguises as spider demons; he purposely provokes them, until she and the others show their true form. During the subsequent battle, the demons come together to form one huge spider. After being poisoned by the spider, Sha Wujing falls ill and slowly bloats into a fish-like creature. Sun Wukong defeats the spider and Tang attempts to exorcise her, but Sun Wukong smashes in the demon's head with one blow. Once more, Tang is annoyed at Sun Wukong's disobedience and whips him again that evening. Later that night, the enraged Sun Wukong discusses with the other disciples his plans to kill Tang, but the others fear Tang's mighty Buddha Palm powers. Tang overhears this conversation and prays to Buddha to help him and also confesses that he actually does not know, or have, Buddha Palm powers. Zhu Bajie overhears this admission and tells Sun Wukong, who challenges Tang to a fight. Just as Sun Wukong is about to strike, a blinding ray of light shines from the heavens and he retreats.
The next day, the group pass into the capital city of the Biqiu Kingdom and a minister (Yao Chen) comes out to greet them and bring them to see the king: an immature and childlike man who likes to play games. The king orders Tang to perform for him but the monk doesn't have anything to showcase. Sun Wukong therefore pastes an ""obedience sticker"" on Tang allowing Tang to copy his actions and perform stunts for the king. Sun Wukong, however, goes too far and makes Tang slap the king continuously, who throws them all out. Tang orders Sun Wukong to return and apologize, but it is revealed that Sun Wukong purposely provoked the king to make him reveal his form as the demon Red Boy. They fight and Sun Wukong defeats Red Boy, also freeing the true king of Biqiu (Bao Bei'er) from his cage under the throne. As a reward for helping him, the king presents them with a beautiful girl, Felicity (Lin Yun), to accompany them on their travels. As Felicity dances for them, Tang is reminded of his deceased lover, Ms Duan (Shu Qi).
The group set off and on the way, Sun Wukong realizes that Felicity is actually a demon. Tang, however, does not believe him, so they set off to visit Felicity's home village. Sun Wukong becomes enraged with Tang's lack of trust in him and that night he destroys the whole village, killing everyone. Tang stops him from killing Felicity, further angering Sun Wukong, who attacks Tang, but Felicity finally confesses that she is actually the demon White Bone Spirit and that the whole village was an illusion conjured by her. Sun Wukong flares up and turns into a giant gorilla and swallows Tang. At that moment, the minister and Red Boy arrive and see that Monkey has fallen for their trick.
They had deliberately sent Felicity with the group to cause strife between Tang and Sun Wukong, so Sun Wukong would kill his master. Sun Wukong spits Tang out, however, as they had, in fact, known this all along, but played along with story, so that the minister would reveal her true form. They battle and the minister creates an illusion of Buddhas surrounding Monkey, using them to fight him. The real Buddha, however, uses his giant palm to destroy the false Buddhas and reveals the minister's real identity as the Immortal Golden Vulture.
After the battle, Tang heads back to find Felicity. He has no choice but to free her soul as there is too much demon in her. When Felicity asks Tang if he loves her, Tang replies that he has only one person in his heart.

Cook Up a Storm,"The story focuses on two young talented chefs, Sky Ko (Nicholas Tse), a southern-style Chinese chef, and Paul Ahn (Jung Yong-hwa), a Michelin-starred Korean chef trained in France. Both with reasons to climb the culinary ladder as top chefs. In the past, when Sky was ten years old, his father, Mountain Ko ( Anthony Wong), left him behind with his friend, Uncle Seven (Ge You), master chef of Seven Restaurant. When asked why, Mountain told Sky that he has no talent as a cook and Mountain would only take him back if he can prove to be a great cook. In reality though, Mountain chose to pursue his culinary career over being a father and made the excuse that Sky can't even make a decent bowl of noodles right to make him a worthy son. Because of that, Sky spent the next twenty years to become a great chef under Uncle Seven's training. On the other side, Paul made a promise to his dying father that he would become a great cook. Through that journey, he became a highly successful chef in Europe and decided to run his own restaurant in Hong Kong, Stellar. However, this would bring conflicts to both Paul and Sky.
In an old area of Hong Kong, Sky is now an acclaimed chef at Seven. However, the Li Management Group arrived and started buying various properties of the old sector, including developing Stellar for Paul. The opening of Stellar proved to be a threat to Sky as these two chefs find themselves fighting for the best ingredients in the markets and maintaining their clientele. Stellar's fine haute cuisine represented a form of aggressive gentrification to the neighborhood and a threat to traditional Chinese cuisine. Their rivalry began with a challenge for the best fish and the culinary masters agreed to face each other in a culinary duel. Sky made a traditional salt-baked duck while Paul made a foie gras sorbet. While both tied in points, the judges gave victory to Paul as his dish presentation was superior to Sky's bland plating. Although the victory should've solidified Paul's abilities as a cook, things didn't go as expected.
Mayo is Paul's sous chef and girlfriend. It was while celebrating their victory that the manager of Li Group tells Paul he wants to replace him with Mayo, reasoning that a woman is far more appealing on media than a man. Betrayed and confused, Paul tried to defend his position as head chef, but Mayo exposed his dark secret: he can't taste everything. Paul has problems tasting certain flavors, especially saltiness. To compensate, he would utilize a notebook that contains all his recipes and have others test taste to compensate for his poor sense of taste. To make matters worse, the manager announces that he and Mayo are romantically involved. Mayo explained to Paul that she never loved him and only sided with him to surpass him. Now that she can take the title as executive chef of Stellar, she doesn't need Paul anymore. Angry that he has lost everything, Paul left.
It was while at an event stadium, Sky would bump into Paul drinking. Both shared their past and troubles and found mutual respect for each other. Both have a common goal of reaching to the culinary top and decided to team up. At Seven, the Li Group wants Uncle Seven to sign away his restaurant as the group is buying off the old sector to make it their own. Unrelenting to surrender, Uncle Seven refused. It was then Paul and Sky appeared, announcing their partnership. Paul reminded the manager that he was the winner of the competition, which makes him eligible to compete at the culinary championship, not the Li Group. Surprised by that technicality, the Li Group left, not before the manager called Paul a traitor. Sky would train Paul in the ways of Chinese cooking as well as developing Paul's limited palate to help create something new for the competition.
In Macau, at the Studio City Casino, attending the 7th International Culinary Competition, Sky and Paul use both their culinary strengths to compete against four other great chefs. Whoever wins the competition will gain the chance to face the current God of Cookery, Mountain Ko. In this competition, they have a French team, Indian team, a Japanese chef, and Mayo to face off. Mayo somehow still got into the competition and now uses her training against Paul. The French team made a roasted squab dish, the Indian team made a five-flavor curry, the Japanese chef made koi nigiri, Mayo made an oyster dish with frozen foam, and the duo made a deconstructed mapo tofu. Paul used Sky's sense of taste to help him determine the flavor of the ingredients they used to cook and Sky relied on Paul's knowledge of molecular science and culinary artistry to create a traditional dish with a modern design. The winner goes to Paul and Sky. Although Paul had limited tasting ability, his artistry and cooking imagination exceeds Mayo and she lost, visibly embarrassed.
The next round is to face Chef Ko. Paul pointed out only one chef can compete against Mountain and he realized Sky's desire to beat Mountain was a very personal one. Grateful he managed to make it this far with his condition, Paul gave Sky the chance to face his father. In the final competition, Sky finally faces his father and the judges allow the two to cook anything they wanted as long as it is considered the highest expression of cooking. While Mountain began cooking, Sky was at a stand, thinking about how Seven and the people in the neighborhood means the most to him. Mountain angrily splashed water at his son's face, demanding him to focus and show him something. Mountain created a beautiful artistic sugar display of molten lava with a single flower on top. Sky went for something far more personal, it was a personal interpretation of the original noodle dish that Mountain made all those years ago before abandoning Sky. Before the judges could even score the dish, Sky gave the bowl of noodles to Mountain and he was moved as he remembered what the noodles meant. Acknowledging his skills as a chef, Mountain called his son brilliant before Sky walked off the stage. Mountain would continue to emotionally eat his noodles, unclear of a victor.
Some time has passed and the people at Seven are getting ready for a poon choi Chinese New Year party with the neighborhood's people. Much of the ending is left to personal interpretation, as the culinary championship, personal relations, and the fate of the neighborhood are left unresolved. The movie ends with the staff of Seven announcing: We wish you all 2017 a happy rooster year!"

Bei Zhai, having witnessed this, escapes, with Shen Lian too injured to pursue her. Shen Lian covers up his role in Ling's murder and gives a statement that two assassins ambushed them and killed Ling. The case is being handled by Captain Pei Lun, who seems to have a dislike for Captain Shen Lian. It is later revealed that Yin Cheng was Pei Lun's only friend, and that he hates Shen Lian for the death of Yin Cheng.
A group of assassins contact Shen Lian to reveal that they know of his role in Ling'g murder, and that they will expose him using Bei Zhai if he does not set fire to the Imperial Archives.

A real estate company is pulling down his house and that of his comrade's family during the funeral. The boss of the real estate company confronts them with a gun and sneers at them for presenting the remains to the family, only for the boss to be kicked to the ground. The boss calls on his henchmen to attack them but they are all swiftly disabled by Feng and the other soldiers. Police arrive shortly after and ask Leng Feng to put down the gun he confiscated from the boss. The boss gets back up and boasts that he will ""make the family wish they were dead"", enraging Feng to a point that he kicks the boss in the stomach, sending him crashing onto the windshield of a police car and killing him. Leng Feng is sent to a military prison for two years and discharged from the Chinese army.
After release from prison, Feng leaves for Africa, planning to wander for the rest of his life.

The freighter arrives safely at its destination. For three years Feng has been carrying a bullet which he found, a clue to the kidnapping of his fiancée, Lieutenant Colonel Long Xiaoyun, that happened while she was on a mission.
Feng and some locals are partying on a beach one day when they are attacked by rebel forces aiming to overthrow the government of the African nation. Shortly after the arrival of the Rebels and mercenaries who overrun the government troops, the Chinese fleet arrives to evacuate Chinese nationals caught up in the civil war. While on board, a Chinese shop owner that he helped rescue tells him that the bullet he is carrying belongs to European mercenaries who are helping the rebels. After overhearing guards talking about needing someone to rescue workers at a factory and an important doctor who knows the vaccination for Lamanla (Dr Chen), Leng Feng volunteers. However, he is on his own as no other personnel can follow him while they are on foreign soil without permission from the Chinese military's higher authorities. He travels to the hospital, 60 kilometres away from the dock and enters the hospital building just as Dr Chen is accidentally killed by the mercenaries. With his dying breaths Dr Chen tells him to take his daughter, an African girl named Pasha. Leng Feng and Pasha, along with a female doctor Rachel Smith, escape the grip of the mercenaries.

At the factory, Feng tells everyone that the Chinese fleet will be sending a helicopter to rescue them. The women and children will evacuate via helicopter and everyone else will walk to the fleet. Feng with his old pal and Yifan saved the factory crew members from the red scarf members and deadly mercenaries. Feng is about to be killed when Big Daddy, the other mercenaries and rebels are ordered to fall back. The leader tells Big Daddy that no Chinese can die because he needs China when he is in power, since China is part of the United Nations Security Council. Big Daddy kills the leader of the rebellion and takes over as leader. He orders everyone to go back to the factory to retrieve Pasha and kill Feng. In the factory, Feng chooses to leave as the factory workers learn of his infection with Lamanla.

One day, Bai Qian is invited to the East Sea to attend a party. There, she runs into a little boy who steals her fan. When she notices the boy missing, she spots a lady dropping the fan. The lady is recognized by Bai Qian to be Xuan Nu, the Demon Clan's Queen and a shapeshifter. Xuan Nu runs away, only for a man to come running to the boy. Bai Qian, thinking that he is Xuan Nu, tries to stop him from approaching the boy, named Ah Li. While fighting, the man stops and calls her Su Su, suddenly recognizing her as her mask comes off. The man is revealed to be Ye Hua, her betrothed, Ah Li's father, and the Heaven Tribe's Crown Prince. After Ye Hua apologizes, she leaves.
Back in Qing Qiu, Ye Hua and Ah Li has decided to stay with Bai Qian. Ye Hua is determined to make her fall in love with him while Ah Li believes that she's his mother. While Bai Qian is with Zhe Yan, a family friend, Mi Gu, a tree spirit, informs her that someone has come to Qing Qiu to take Ah Li away. While Ah Li is running away from a lady, they both happen to stumble into a cave. The lady sees a man in an ice block and recognizes the man as Mo Yuan. When Bai Qian arrives, the lady introduces herself to be Su Jin, a princess consort of the Heaven Tribe, who happens to be in love with Ye Hua. Ye Hua walks in and tells both of them that Ah Li will be returning to the Heaven Tribe after celebrating his birthday in the mortal realm with his mom and dad.
In the mortal realm, Ye Hua explains that three hundred years ago, he was mortally wounded in a battle and was too exhausted to use his powers. Su Su, a human girl, ended up taking care of him, and as a repayment for her kindness, Ye Hua agreed to marry her. Ye Hua realizes that Su Su and Bai Qian are the same person and wishes that Bai Qian could remember and forget all that happened in the past.
Back in Qing Qiu, Bai Qian visits Mo Yuan, the god of war and a highly respected person in the Heaven Tribe. She preserves him with her blood and talks to him, calling him her master. It is revealed that she has been waiting for him to awaken for seventy thousand years after he had trapped the Demon King, Qing Cang, in a bell. She tells him that she met someone recently who reminded her of Mo Yuan.
After an incident involving Ah Li drinking too much alcohol, Bai Qian and Ye Hua argue. Bai Qian, having developed a close bond with Ah Li, wants them to stay a while longer and doesn't find fault in her actions. Ye Hua, an overprotective dad, dismisses Bai Qian's excuses and leaves for the Heaven Tribe.
While Bai Qian is gone, Xuan Nu comes and steals Mo Yuan's body. Bai Qian and Zhe Yan then rush to the Demon Clan, planning to rescue Mo Yuan. During the fight, Ye Hua shows up and helps Bai Qian, only for the sake of taking Mo Yuan's body back to the Heaven Tribe. After rescuing him, Ye Hua recalls that in the books he studied, it was told that after locking up Qing Cang, Mo Yuan went to live in seclusion with his favorite disciple, Si Yin, who was Bai Qian. She tells him that after Mo Yuan died, she brought him here and waited for him to come back.
The two develop a mutual liking for each other and Ye Hua decides to bring Bai Qian to the Heaven Tribe, hoping to get married. During Bai Qian and Ye Hua's wedding, Su Jin tells Bai Qian more of the story between Su Su and Ye Hua. Ye Hua took Su Su to the Heaven Palace and abandoned her there, driving Su Su to commit suicide. Su Jin warns her and says that Ye Hua is only with her because of the guilt he feels for Su Su. Bai Qian, filled with doubt, leaves him at the altar.
Later on, Bai Qian comes back planning to receive the soul-binding lamp from Ye Hua, so it could speed up the process of her master waking up. They both argue with Bai Qian saying that his heart still belongs to Su Su while Ye Hua claims that there has only been a place in her heart for Mo Yuan. He finally confesses that Su Su and Bai Qian are actually the same person. Finally, Ye Hua lends her the lamp and tells her that he hopes she can forgive him. Her memories are released and it is revealed that Su Jin, who was jealous, had Su Su's eyes removed to replace her own after Su Jin jumped into the execution platform, claiming that Su Su pushed her. When Su Su tried to beg Ye Hua to believe her, but he didnt. Su Su asked Ye Hua to name their baby after the word 'parting' and jumped off of the Execution Platform. When Su Su landed in Qing Qiu, her powers returned and she drank an amnesia potion to forget all the pain that happened to her while she was Su Su. After snapping back to reality, Su Jin approaches her and pushes her off the Execution Platform, but Ye Hua catches her. Ye Hua tries to console Bai Qian, but she leaves him and returns to Qing Qiu.
Nai Nai, Bai Qian/Su Su's maid in the Heaven Palace, pleads Bai Qian to forgive Ye Hua. Nai Nai tells Bai Qian the true story of what actually happened. All the time that Ye Hua abandoned her, he was trying to get permission from the heavenly lord to marry her. And when she jumped off the Execution Platform, Ye Hua jumped after her, harming himself. He even took the lightning punishment that was meant for her for 'pushing' Su Jin.
Ye Hua stays in Qing Qiu, refusing to leave until Bai Qian forgives him. For seven days and nights, Bai Qian refuses to see him or welcome him into Qing Qiu.
At the Bell, Su Jin awakens Qing Cang, hoping that he will kill Ye Hua and Bai Qian for mistreating her. Ye Hua decides to go fight Qing Cang. Bai Qian learns of the news and rushes to go help him, but she is too late. Ye Hua sacrifices himself, just like how Mo Yuan did, to lock up Qing Cang. The river, that the bell is on, freezes and Ye Hua floats away under the ice. Bai Qian follows him and screams, saying that she'll drink the potion again if he dares to die. Ye Hua watches her and sinks to the bottom, his last wish being that she could forget him for all the pain that he has cause her.
Later on, Mo Yuan's ice block cracks and he awakens. As Bai Qian runs to finally see her master, she is stopped by Mo Yuan/Ye Hua standing there and asking her (Qian Qian, a nickname that only Ye Hua called her) to come closer."

The Foreigner,"Ngoc Minh Quan, a Chinese Nuang chef, runs a Chinese restaurant in London. When his teenage daughter Fan is killed in a clothing store bombing, a distraught Quan seeks revenge. The bombing is claimed by a group calling themselves the ""Authentic UDI"" in the film version released in Europe and ""Authentic IRA"" in the version released in certain other countries.[4][5] He first attempts to bribe Scotland Yard officer Richard Bromley for the names of the bombers, but Bromley refuses to accept the bribe or reveal any information. Quan next focuses on the Northern Ireland deputy First Minister Liam Hennessy, who speaks publicly about his status as a former UDI (read: IRA) leader while condemning the bombing. Keyi Lam, Quan's colleague and personal friend, attempts to console and convince him to move on, but he refuses to be swayed and eventually leaves for Belfast to meet Hennessy. Hennessy claims to have no knowledge of the bombing or its perpetrators, but Quan does not believe him. His queries escalate until he becomes fixated on Hennessy, setting off a homemade bomb in his office and threatening more unless he gets the bombers' names.
The truth is that Hennessy, while having ordered the bombings to come with warnings as part of a political ploy to solidify the radical factions, does not actually know who the bombers are, as they are rogue members of the UDI. He is in fact outraged that no warnings were given and civilians were killed. Hennessy tries to identify the bombers by changing the code words they use after any bombings are carried out, but the rogue members catch on and outwit him. Meanwhile, he sends numerous mercenaries and personal enforcers after Quan, who manages to escape or defeat all of them. He also observes Hennessy meeting with his mistress, Maggie, and takes a picture of them kissing. Quan then brings the fight to Hennessy, hiding in the woods outside his Belfast farmhouse and attacking it with more homemade bombs. As Hennessy's men attempt to track him in the woods, Quan uses traps to disable a group of three and attempts to interrogate one of them, but he is shot in the shoulder by a fourth mercenary and flees. Hennessy decides to send for his nephew Sean Morrison, who was part of the Royal Irish Regiment with Bromley, after Quan in hopes that his tracking skills can be used to stop him for good.
As Quan heats up a knife to cauterise the gunshot wound, he faints and has flashbacks of his escape from Vietnam to Singapore by sea, where he and his family are attacked by Thai pirates. He and his wife look on hopelessly as his two daughters are taken away to be raped and murdered by the pirates. As he tried to fight off the pirates, he and his wife were shot and both fell overboard. His wife later died giving birth to their daughter, Fan. Hennessy receives files from the British government on Quan's true background: a former Vietnam War special operations forces soldier who was trained by the US Army.
After a second bombing on a double-decker bus, Hennessy negotiates with British politician Katherine Davies and promises the capture of the bombers in exchange for the pardoning of some of his former UDI comrades. Meanwhile, Bromley manages to identify the bombers and relays their identities to Hennessy, who then relays the information to Sean. After a knife fight in the woods, Quan manages to capture Sean, who reveals the name of one of the bombers: Patrick O'Reilly, who was also behind the bombing that killed Quan's daughter. In return, Quan decides to let Sean go. Hennessy, meanwhile, interrogates his head enforcer McGrath, discovering that the true mastermind is Mary, Hennessy's wife, who also hired Maggie; she has never let go of her anger at the British for the death of her brother and resents Hennessy's working for them. Hennessy executes McGrath for his betrayal and for involving his wife and mistress, then orders Sean to execute Mary—with whom Sean is having an affair—before returning to America.
As the police prepare to raid the bombers' hideout, Quan manages to enter first under the pretense of fixing a gas leak and single-handedly kills all but Maggie. Quan leaves just before the police raid the apartment and find a severely wounded Maggie, whose real name is Sara McKay. They torture her into revealing the location of their next bomb, which has been planted in a laptop computer, to be detonated on a plane going to a security conference in Rome. British police manage to find and throw the laptop into an empty jet bridge, where it detonates without casualties. With the threat resolved, Bromley orders the operation leave ""no loose ends"", which results in Maggie's execution. Hennessy gets a call from Davies, who tells him that he will retain his position as a politician but will be under her thumb.
Quan confronts Hennessy and shows him the picture of Hennessy kissing Maggie, which is enough to throw suspicion on Hennessy and his role in the bombings, as well as expose his affairs if the public sees it. Quan forces him to post the picture to the internet, telling him that he should be ashamed of himself and the whole world will know that he is a terrorist. Meanwhile, Bromley realizes Quan's role in the events and has him put under surveillance, but decides not to take any further action as a way to thank him for his involvement.
The film ends with Quan returning to his restaurant and Lam embracing him as he puts the past behind him."

Cold War 2,"The Hong Kong Police Force holds a funeral for two superintendents killed during the previous film. Shortly after, the commissioner Sean Lau (Aaron Kwok) receives a call from one of the culprits behind the theft of the police van. He is told that his wife has been kidnapped and that he must release Joe Lee (Eddie Peng) for her to survive. Lau overrides standard procedure to transfer Joe out of prison, and is told by the kidnapper to bring Joe to the metro station. There, Joe is able to escape with the aid of several accomplices, one of whom sets off a bomb. The culprits leave Lau's wife alive at the station.
Lau's actions are criticized by the media and by numerous politicians, leading to a public inquiry. Fearing that the police have been infiltrated, Lau privately requests Billy Cheung (Aarif Rahman), an ICAC agent, to form a separate squad independent of the police, so they can track down the culprits. Meanwhile, MB Lee (Tony Leung), a deputy police commissioner who is about to retire, who is also the father of Joe, is confronted by his fugitive son along with Peter Choi (Chang Kuo-chu), a former commissioner who is now manipulating politics behind the scenes. Choi is revealed as the mastermind behind the troubles of the previous film, and his current goal is to remove Lau, who is not a member of his ring, and to place his own followers into positions of power during the next election. Choi has formed a militant band consisting of former police officers who were expelled or faked their own deaths. He promises Lee not only the position of commissioner, but also of security secretary later on, upon which Lee gives into temptation.
A legislator named Oswald Kan (Chow Yun-fat) is convinced by his old friend Lai (Waise Lee), the secretary of justice, to participate in the public inquiry into Lau, but is taken aback when Lee openly criticizes Lau, rather than defending him. Kan deduces that Lee is being controlled, and tells his pupils to investigate, one of whom, Bella Au (Janice Man), decides to secretly follow Lee, and later Choi whom Lee confers with. Realizing that they are being followed, Choi orders a subordinate to crash into Au's car, causing a chain collision in which Au is killed, and Choi's car is trapped. Lau arrives to investigate, and a shoot-out occurs, in which Joe is shot and severely injured by Lau, but Choi escapes. Kan finds a photograph taken by Au of Choi and Lee together.
Lau's independent squad finds the location of Choi's remaining henchmen and the stolen police van. Lee, meanwhile, convinces or bribes several senior police officers to sign a petition for Lau's removal. In the final hours before Lau steps down, he launches a raid on the henchmen, and requests that Lee take command, noting that, since the henchmen are renegade police officers formerly under Lee, Lee would best know their strategies. Lee accepts, knowing that he cannot refuse without looking weak, but since he is secretly close friends with those henchmen, killing them taxes him emotionally. The operation is a success, with all suspects killed, and Kan and Lau report Lee's and Choi's crimes to the chief executive, who decides to grant amnesty to Lee and Choi, since they are too important to arrest without destabilizing society. Lee is forced into retirement, and Choi is permanently exiled from Hong Kong, but otherwise, their exact crimes are never disclosed to the public. Lau retains his office as commissioner, and Lee visits his son, who is in custody, and lying in a bed at the hospital."

Happiness,"After the death of his mother, Chan Kai-yuk (Carlos Chan) moves from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and attempts to reunite with his father (Chin Siu-ho) who has abandoned them and started a new marriage already. Sacked from a restaurant, Chan cannot afford the housing rental fee and is forced to leave. While sleeping on the street, he is helped by Kam (Louis Cheung) who is a chef at Beloved Community Centre, which is dedicated to providing support for the needy in the area. Although he is offered a job at the centre, he cannot accept it unless he has a proof of address. He then turns to seek help from Tse Yuen-fan (Kara Wai) who he randomly encountered and helped at a wet market previously.
Tse is a middle-aged childless ex-singer who lives by herself after her only tenant moved out. Initially suspicious of Chan, she later accepts him to be her new tenant after he gives her a dozen of eggs as present. She lives a simple and routine lifestyle and demands that Chan strictly follow her timetable at the living room. Now with a residential address, Chan starts to work at Beloved, where he is introduced to Xiaoyue (Cya Liu), a social work intern student from Guangzhou, and Fong (Yan Ng), a social worker. Assigned to a food sharing scheme, Chan co-operates with Xiaoyue whom he has a crush on but knows about her relationship later.

With Fat's assistance, Chan is able to locate his father along with his new family. He then secretly takes his step younger brother to an indoor playground and treats him with ice-cream. Nevertheless, he is unaware of his brother's peanut allergy, which causes the boy to develop acute symptoms. When taking him to the hospital, Chan is beaten his angry father, who is ordered by his new wife to cut any connections with him. When Chan tearfully agrees not to disturb his father's life again, he is comforted by Tse and Xiaoyue. There, Tse asks Chan to call her mother.

Living like a family, Tse is indulged in her past hobby of drawing and Chan starts his new job at a restaurant. At a visit to Beloved, he is told that Xiaoyue has already returned to Guangzhou. Her leaving note reveals that she has been admiring his love towards his terminally ill mother since they met before at a Guangzhou hospital, although he did not recognise her.

League of Gods,"During the reign of King Zhou (Tony Leung Ka-fai), an official enters his bedchamber, and is devoured by the monstrous tails of Daji (Fan Bingbing), his concubine. Outside their city, several warriors within a metal wagon discuss their strategies to free the Invisible People and their Chief, when Jiang Ziya (Jet Li) appears to them. He tells them that when King Zhou was younger, he let himself become possessed by the Black Dragon for his quest for power. Jiang Ziya later departs riding his crane.
Within the city, King Zhou and Daji hold a festival, and torture the chief of the Invisible People to foretell his future. The chief shows King Zhou a vision of himself pleading for mercy and disintegrating away, causing the King to order his guards to remove the chief's eyes. At the same time, the warriors sneak into a prison and fight several guards, where Leizhenzi (Jacky Heung), a member of the Wing Adept tribe, uses his powers to destroy the metal bars that seal the Invisible People, even though he was warned not to use them there. His powers attracts Shen Gong Bao's (Louis Koo) attention, and he rides on his black leopard to pursue them. Several of the Invisible People are then killed by more guards. Nonetheless, the warriors manage to escape with the Invisible Children, who use their powers to teleport to another location. To stop Shen Gong Bao from advancing any further, Leizhenzi destroys a wall and creates a barrier. As Leizhenzi and Ji Fa (Andy On) talk, he explains about his past in which his father was killed by an invading army that exterminated most of the Wing Adepts, and his father's wings were torn off his back.
Jiang Ziya arrives to interrupt the festival and stops time, allowing him to free the Invisible chief, and help the warriors and the Invisible Children to escape. As Jiang Ziya avoids Daji's tails, she casts a magic spell at him. To save him, the chief digs out one eye and throws it towards Daji to distract her, but he gets destroyed by her tails instead. Jiang Ziya escapes to his crane with one of the chief's eyes, while the other eye is obtained by Daji.
The warriors return to their capital. Leizhenzi tries to grow wings where King Ji Chang (Zu Feng) requests Jiang Ziya to use the chief's eye to find a way to defeat King Zhou and the Black Dragon. Jiang Ziya answers that it is by using a sword known as the ""Sword of Light"", which can only be used by the chosen hero ""Golden Dragon"", and that they must find the sword before the three suns converge, in which the Black Dragon will be released. But while doing so, Jiang Ziya becomes younger, as he warned that Daji cast a spell on him that reverses his age, and for each time he uses his magic the reverse-aging accelerates.
Leizhenzi volunteers to find the sword, and Jiang Ziya tells him that he must take three gifts from the Spring of Life with him. He also summons an egg from the well, out of which Ne Zha hatches and causes mischief. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha depart into a wasteland, where the first of Jiang Ziya's gifts, a one-eyed plant, gives Leizhenzi advice. Ne Zha plays with the plant, and the three are chased by an enormous centipede-like worm, which Leizhenzi kills. Ne Zha steals from Leizhenzi the second gift: a baby Dragon Prince whose growth was stunted by Ne Zha, and it subdues the quickly-grown Ne Zha (Wen Zhang) by breathing a gas on him, making him unconscious while turning him into an adult. Upon waking, Leizhenzi forces him to help him find the Sword of Light, while promising to him that he will help Ne Zha find his Fire Wheels.
Shen Gong Bao constructs and animates an automaton (Angelababy), and instructs her to find and kill Leizhenzi. Leizhenzi and Ne Zha stumble into a collection of pillars within a marsh, which turn into a palace in a desert, where a hermit (Huang Xiaoming) manipulates sand with magic.Irritated, the hermit attacks them, but is defeated. The hermit is revealed to be Erlang Shen. Leizhenji gives Erlang Shen the third of Jiang Ziya's gifts: his faithful dog Howling Celestial. Erlang Shen then leaves them to find his Golden Armor.
Leizhenzi and Ne Zha travel to a port, where the former encounters a beautiful woman who entertains children with glowing butterflies, whose name is Lan Die, in reality the automaton. Leizhenzi and Lan Die go find a sorceress Taiyi Zhenren, who uses his dreams to read into his mind. After being woken by the plant, Lan Die steals the artifact that they use as a ship to sail out of the port, and Ne Zha follows. That ship is supposed to sail to any location that its user desires. While in the ship, Ne Zha torments the baby Dragon Prince, who breathes gas on Ne Zha again to put him to sleep and reverting him back to a child. Lan Die and Leizhenzi admire the sunrise, but Shen Gong Bao takes her memories away, revealing her to be an automaton.
Leizhenzi wonders why is the ship going to the middle of the ocean, and the plant answers that it is because someone else, the baby dragon prince, has controlled the ship to return to his father's palace. As the Dragon Prince sings, the Dragon King of the East Sea (Waise Lee) hears him and orders his giant octopus to bring Ne Zha and his son back to him. While in the sea palace, Ne Zha demands the Dragon King to return his Fire Wheels to him. The Dragon King orders his guards to attack Ne Zha, but he defeats them by urinating and passing gas at them. The Dragon King gives Ne Zha the Fire Wheels, and is given the baby dragon prince in exchange. With the fire wheels, Ne Zha turns into an adult and flies away.
The ship is now able to fly to Leizhenzi's former home, which is now in ruins. He finds the Sword of Light, which is guarded by several rapidly-moving rings that surround its floating island. Shen Gong Bao arrives with a fleet of flying ships, and subdues Leizhenzi. In exchange for Leizhenzi's life, Lan Die overcomes the rapid rings, and retrieves the sword, but it inadvertently destroys the rings and blows Shen Gong Bao and his fleet away. Leizhenzi grows new wings and carries the dying Lan Die to see the sunset. She turns into a wooden mannequin, and he leaves her to rest at the sword's island, taking the sword with him. As he notices the suns beginning to converge, he hurries with Ne Zha and Erlang Shen (who has found his golden armor) back to the capital, which is now under siege by another fleet of King Zhou's flying ships. As Jiang Jiya struggles to use the city's defense system properly, Daji uses her magic again to revive Shen Gong Bao, which turns him into an invincible monster.
The three heroes return with the Sword of Light to find Jiang Ziya being reverted to a young boy. They fight Shen Gong Bao, who during the fight kills Ji Chang. With his dying breath, Ji Chang passes his command and the sword to his son, Ji Fa. Ji Fa rushes to the Spring of Life and dives in to charge the sword. As the heroes draw Shen Gong Bao into the Spring of Life, Ji Fa emerges as the ""Golden Dragon"" with his charged sword and new golden armor, and kills the monster.
The movie ends with Ji Fa mobilizing his forces for a counter attack and flies his fortress towards the Shang kingdom, while King Zhou turns into the Black Dragon awaiting for the heroes to attack, with a baby Jiang Ziya in their possession."
The Menu,"The invention of smart phones has accelerated the decline in print journalism, which online journalism has been replacing. Two years after the death of Kenny Wong and the departure of editor-in-chief Alma Wong, Smart Post is facing a direct challenge from Flash Post, whose online articles receive considerable click rate on its first date of publication. Fong Ying (Catherine Chau), Smart Post's interim editor-in-chief, is warned by CEO Chong Nga-yuen (Justin Cheung) that the newspaper will be forced to shut down if it loses in the competition with Flash Post. On her first day as photojournalist, Mallory Mak (Kate Yeung) comes across the award-winning photo ""The Starving of Sudan"" and discusses the ethics behind photojournalism with her colleague and boyfriend Lok Ka-fai (Gregory Wong).
Young entrepreneur Ko Yin-yan is interviewed at the television station C99. Seven years ago, he raped and murdered a 17-year-old girl but was acquitted of all charges after he bribed a key witness. Although the witness admitted to giving false testimony later, Ko was unable to be charged again owing to the principle of ""double jeopardy"", which forbids the prosecution to press the same charge against the same person again. Furious at seeing the murderer of her daughter remain at large, Tam Yui-chi (Ng Man-tat) has long been under hunger strikes protesting the government's slow progress in abolishing double jeopardy despite professional recommendations, but his solo actions have been constantly ignored and at one point mocked by Lok, who told him he can never gain any media attention unless he has a mass support group or he commits a crime. Seeing Ko's visit to the television studio as a chance, Tam, a technician at C99, detonates explosives and takes Ko hostage along with several colleagues of his. Tam demands the Chief Executive, Lo Kin-kuen, to meet with him before midnight, otherwise he will kill all the hostages and himself. He then sends a voice message to his wife Chim Sui-wah (Mimi Kung) informing her of his action, which triggers her cardiac attack and causes her minibus to crash at a high speed.
Mak and Lok witness Chim's accident along with many journalists near the scene. Although Lok acts fast to discover Chim's mobile phone and to establish her relation with the hostage-taker, Flash Post overtakes Smart Post in sending the push notification of the breaking news. Fong decides to gain back click rate by asking Lok to break into the studio and to conduct a live online interview with Tam via a handheld transceiver. After Tam discloses the story of her daughter to the public, the interview is cut short by the police. Flash Post's Fung (Ben Yeung) and Zhong Kaiqi (Jeana Ho) follow suit but intentionally provoke Tam to make him assault Ko while broadcast live.
Lok traces the threatening messages in Chim's phone to Ko's father, a Guangzhou tycoon with a close relation with Lo, whom he confronts in person. Blaming himself for instigating Tam's action, he questions Fong's order to publish online the secretly-filmed video and instead takes it to the government Information Coordinator (Deon Cheung) to demand Lo's immediate intervention. Lo initially refuses, but agrees to send a delegate to negotiate after Fong reveals Ko's uncle is the legislator delaying the law reform regarding double jeopardy.
The preliminary talk between Tam and Lok as Lo's delegate goes well, and Tam releases four of the hostages. However, after seeing the photos of his wife's corpse published by Flash Post, a desperate Tam cuts the connection with the police and sets off the explosives to kill some of the hostages. Amidst a public uproar against Flash Post, Zhong resigns from the newspaper and Mak vows to take photojournalism back to the right cause. Smart Post's infographic video goes viral on social media and online forums, and attracts thousands to flood into the streets outside C99 station. Half an hour before the deadline, knowing about the mass of people gathering outside in support of him, Tam surrenders to the police.
Although Smart Post loses in terms of click rates by a narrow margin to Flash Post, whose editor-in-chief has just resigned, Fong is indifferent to this but summarises journalists' attitude with Kevin Kelly's message on the Whole Earth Catalog: ""Stay hungry. Stay Foolish."""

With the departure of the most outstanding member, the Shatin Martins work closer and train harder together, finally winning the tickets to the final of the league.

Worried about Wai, Lung fails to concentrate on playing and is hit in the face by the ball struck by the batter. As he falls onto the ground, he realises he must stand up by himself to prove himself capable to Wai. The Shatin Martins manages to come up from behind and eventually wins by 13-12, becoming the first Hong Kong team to win the championship.
Although Wai is seriously injured, he survives and is taken care of at hospital. Lung learns how to adapt to changes, looking to his father and Tsz-ching as examples.

Bastu Shaap,"Kushal (Parambrata Chatterjee) and Timir (Kaushik Ganguly) are Vaastu Shastra experts who are hired by Arjun (Abir Chatterjee) to examine the Vaastu of his Bungalow in Darjeeling. Kushal is instructed to masquerade as Arjun's school friend and Timir as Kushal's business partner, and are brought in to Arjun's Bungalow for the project under the pretext of a chance reunion between Arjun and Kushal. Arjun introduces them to his older sister Antara (Churni Ganguly) and his wife Bonya (Raima Sen), who seemingly recognizes Kushal.
It becomes apparent that the household is in a disarray. Years earlier, Arjun and his family met with a car accident, due to which Arjun has suffered a permanent injury to his leg, and Antara has lost her husband and her only child. Upon Arjun's recovery, he moved to Darjeeling, but the family is unable to recuperate from their losses. Arjun and Bonya become distant while Antara obsesses over Bonya's son as a coping mechanism for losing her own, which creates tension between Bonya and Antara. Timir and Kushal get to work on their Vaastu Shastra modifications to the Bungalow.
It is also revealed in interleaved flashbacks that Kushal and Bonya had met earlier after Bonya's family accident at the same hospital, where Arjun and Kushal's wife were admitted. Kushal and Bonya developed a slow friendship, and he gave her a crystal ball, asking her to put it beside Arjun's bed in hopes of speeding his recovery. One day Bonya visits Kushal's house and she sees a painting of Kushal's palm painted by Kushal's wife, dubbed The Lotus. Arjun recovers from his coma soon after, but Kushal's wife dies the same day. Kushal leaves for his wife's cremation while Bonya unable to find him moves on with Arjun.
Kushal sees The Lotus hanging on Bonya's bedroom wall. Bonya is distraught with Arjun no longer being attracted to her, and the two express their love for each other momentarily. Bonya asks Kushal to do everything in his power to restore Arjun back to her. The very next day Arjun challenges Kushal to a duel, with Timir serving as Kushal's champion. After reaching a stalemate, Arjun decides to settle the duel on a suddent death -- Bonya would volunteer with a bottle on her head as the target for the shooters. Timir, realizing Kushal's love and fear for Bonya's safety deliberately loses the duel. Later that night Arjun rudely asks Kushal and Timir to leave his Bungalow the next morning after collecting their fees.
Kushal agrees to leave, but instead of money he says he wants to take away with him their Bastu-Shaap -- a snake or a curse that lives in a household and yet is not killed or warded off despite being a potential danger to everyone in the house, since everyone gets used to it. He says this is the least he can do for the family before he departs without completing his project. He asks to take with him The Lotus, which Arjun confesses to have never liked, although Bonya always refused to give it away. He privately also asks Antara to leave Arjun and Bonya alone in their house and come with him to an NGO to take care of orphan children -- a place that would fulfil her need to be a motherly figure while leaving Arjun and Bonya to resume a normal family.
Next morning, Antara is nowhere to be found and Arjun departs to search for her. Kushal bids farewell to Bonya who asks him to take his old crystal ball and bring it to her father who is very sick, believing that it will miraculously save him, just like it saved Arjun in the past. Driving out of the Bungalow Kushal and Timir meet Arjun, who confesses that he heard Bonya and Arjun professing their love for each other, when Bonya accidentally dropped her phone and it dialed his number. He says that hearing them, made him jealous and realize how much he loved and was possessive about Bonya and hence the duel and him throwing Kushal and Timir out rudely earlier. Later down the road they meet Antara, who was waiting for them to arrive. She gets in their car, and asks if the scarf she was knitting earlier would fit anyone in the orphanage. Kushal smiles and realizes that Antara has agreed to move out of Arjun and Bonya's household, and move on with her life. The three drive away and fade into the hilly fog of Darjeeling having effectively solved all of Arjun and Bonya's household problems."

Cinemawala,"Pranabendu Bose, an aged man, owns a cinema hall named Kamalini. He is assisted by his long-time assistant Hari. Ever since the trend of digital viewing of cinemas by use of DVD and CDs have gained pace, Kamalini is facing loss. What infuriates Pranabendu the most is that his own son Prakash is engaged in selling illegal CDs and DVDs. The cinema-addict in Pranabendu believes cinema is fit to be seen only in the big screen, and therefore, curses Prakash for denigrating the medium of cinema by selling illegal DVDs. Pranabendu also fears that any day Prakash will be wound up by the Police and that will burn his own hard-earned respect to ashes. Such is his disgust for Prakash that when local political leader Sudhanshu requests Pranabendu to stand in local panchayat elections, Pranabendu turns down the offer by saying he can't face questions from people regarding the illegal nature of the business which his own son runs. Beside the cinema hall, Pranabendu and Prakash attend to their long-time family business of distributing fish to vendors. Prakash's wife Moumita is expecting their first child.

Pranabendu rushes to the hall to retrieve Hari's hanging body. Prakash accompanies Hari's dead body to the crematorium. Once everybody had left, Pranabendu locks himself up in his beloved cinema hall and burns it down. Thematic Representations in the movie: The film tries to depict the present scenario of the world of Indian cinema and the effects of piracy, copyright infringement, and theft. Nowadays, due to the availability of the internet, we often do not realize that we are criminals of Intellectual Property Theft. Moreover, the artists who work so hard are not truly paid for their work as these sites providing us with the free songs and movies do not acknowledge the artists. As shown in the movie Pranabendu Bose is a victim to the modern-day technology. He is passionate about movies and his passion is not well understood by most of us in this generation including his own son, Prakash. Prakash sells illicit pirated movie CDs which angers Pranabendu so much so that the two do not speak living in the same house. Kamalini, the cinema hall owned by Pranabendu is abandoned as no one really goes to watch movies on the big screen and he ultimately burns down the hall with him in it in order to preserve the world of Cinema."
Praktan,"Praktan (former) is basically about Ujaan Mukherjee (Prosenjit) and Sudipa (Rituparna) who have gone through a marriage that did not work. But the director duo has preferred not to show a straightforward relationship tale of these two individuals, preferring instead to use the medium of a train journey to narrate the journey of their failing relationship. The film begins with various people shown boarding a first class A.C. compartment of Jnaneshwari Express from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Kurla in Mumbai, the start of a long journey to Kolkata (Howrah). Sudipa finds herself sharing her coupe with Malini aka Molly (Aparajita Adhya) and her young daughter Putul. Others in the compartment include the newly wedded couple Ajay (Biswanath Basu) and his wife (Manali Dey), an elderly couple (Soumitra Chatterjee) and (Sabitri Chatterjee), who are off to Kolkata as their son’s family is departing to the U.S and a group of 4 musicians (popular musicians in real life – (Anupam Roy) along with (Anindya Chatterjee) and (Upal Sengupta) of the popular band 'Chandrabindo'o and (Surojit Chatterjee) who was part of another popular band, 'Bhoomi'). In their own ways, some of the passengers seem to be having something about their past on their minds. The newly married couple briefly talk to each other about their past relationships and get on with their fondness for each other. The elderly couple is sad to leave behind their children but know that they have to move on with their own lives. One of the musicians reminisces about his association with the band that he was part of and his co-founder. And Sudipa finds herself in a spot of bother as she realizes that Malini and Putul are none other than Ujaan’s present wife and daughter. Upset over the same, she clearly demonstrates that she has not completely forgiven Ujaan for whatever happened between them and seems to carry the burden of their memories. A common love for heritage and culture had seen the conservation architect from Mumbai, Sudipa fall in love with Ujaan, an explorer as he liked to call himself and someone who conducted walks of different nature all over Kolkata and nearby towns as a tourist guide. But, of course, life after marriage turned out to be unlike what they had expected leading to their eventual separation.
Over the course of the 30 odd hours of the train journey, we come across not just a way of knowing how all these passengers spend their time, but also get an insight into the failed marriage of Ujaan and Sudipa. Ujaan joins them at Nagpur after driving down by road to catch the train. He is surprised to find Sudipa in the same coupe as his family. A non-linear approach in a subtle manner is used to shift the focus on and off from the train journey to the relationship between the two individuals who started off being madly in love, only to see their marriage crumbling in front of their own eyes. They ensure that the focus is more or less only on these two individuals when their past is shown, there is a mention of Ujaan’s close friend and Sudipa’s parents, but they are never really shown. Even the rest of the family members of Ujaan are barely showcased in an attempt to take us through their relationship curve. Over the course of their story we also get to understand how and what went wrong in case of their marriage. Beginning with a sense of apprehension and even disgust in a way, it’s wonderful to see Sudipa gradually opening up to Malini and acknowledging how wrong she was in her assumption about her. There are lots of wonderful moments in the film, like the one where the old lady complains to the railway attendant about the AC and other aspects in horrible Bangla mixed Hindi as her husband humorously points out later. Also, the way Ujaan and Sudipa manage to just about have a soulful discussion about their past and of course the interaction between Malini and Sudipa right at the end. Apart from the “Antakshari” sequence, there is hardly any interaction between the people on the coach. But then, this is essentially the story of Ujaan and Sudipa and their failed relationship. It’s wonderful to see how well-etched Malini’s character is and she is the one who in a way helps bring closure in the lives of both Ujaan and Sudipa."

Apart from them are Shibo Prasad's two sons Ananada (Saheb Chatterjee) and Raktim Prasad (Dev).

The next morning while Rohan is at work, Amit and Wasim sneak into the house and gang rape Supriya. A horrified Rohan immediately calls the police; Officer Chaubey advises him to get his wife medically examined in 24 hours to prove the assault. While Rohan and Supriya are on their way to the clinic, they are kidnapped by Shellar's men and held captive for 36 hours. After being set free, Rohan and Supriya are criticised by police for the delay in getting Supriya clinically examined, and both are accused of being liars. Heartbroken, they return home. Supriya attempts to live normally but Rohan becomes silent and introspective, which hurts her.
One morning, Rohan returns early from work to apologise to Supriya for not being as supportive as he should have, only to find her corpse, hanging from the ceiling fan. Madhavrao visits Rohan and reveals that his brother Amit raped Supriya not once but twice. Rohan finds Supriya's braille note, which ascertains that Amit had raped her a second time; this second assault led to her suicide. Shattered, Rohan changes. He implies to Officer Chaubey that he will avenge his wife's death, challenging that Chaubey will know who did it but will be able to do nothing about it, just like he did nothing about Supriya's rape.

Rohan later relates the story to Chaubey: he made it look as if Amit killed Wasim, then Madhavrao committed suicide due to the pain of Amit's death. With no evidence against Rohan, a blind man, Chaubey stands helpless. Rohan, his revenge complete, scatters Supriya's ashes at sea."

Jolly LLB 2,"Jagdishwar ""Jolly"" Mishra is a Lucknow based lawyer who stays with his beautiful wife Pushpa Pandey and works as an assistant to one of the most famous lawyers of Lucknow, Mr. Rizvi. To arrange money for his own chamber, Jolly lies to a widow, Hina Qasim telling her that Rizvi will take her case and that the fee is 200,000 rupees. When Hina finds out that she has been bluffed by Jolly, she commits suicide. Jolly soon discovers that Hina's husband Iqbal Qasim was killed in a fake encounter on the very next day of their marriage by Inspector Suryaveer Singh, showing him as Mohammed Iqbal Quadri, a terrorist. Singh also shot dead a fellow constable, Bhadouria in order to show the encounter as genuine.
Filled with guilt, Jolly decides to fight Hina's case & files a PIL. Singh then hires Lucknow's best lawyer Pramod Mathur to fight his case. After reprimanding Jolly for his mistakes in filing the PIL and no credible evidence, Justice Sunderlal Tripathi gives a date for hearing and warns Jolly to collect some evidence before the hearing.
Jolly is able to get FIR copy and papers regarding the case with the help of a bookie Guru Ji in Varanasi by paying him subsequent amount . Later he is able to track Ram Kumar Bhadauria, the son of the constable who died in the fake encounter. This backfires as Advocate Mathur, uses his power and money to tamper with the narco test video of the witness. Though the Judge orders disciplinary action against Jolly for showing alleged dishonest evidence, The chairman of the Discipline Committee, Mr. Rizvi gives Jolly 4 days of time to prove himself correct, as he also feels guilty of not fighting the case himself.
Jolly travels to Kashmir and gets confirmation of the truth from Fahim Butt, a constable who visited Lucknow to identify the terrorist during Iqbal Qasim and Hina's wedding. Fahim, now suspended and arrested in a fake case, reveals that the person who died in the encounter was not the real terrorist and that he also filed a complaint against Singh. Jolly flees with Fahim to Lucknow. Meanwhile, Jolly coaxes the police commissioner V.K Paul to tell the truth or else, he will file PIL against all the encounters done by him. Advocate Mathur, tries his best to avoid Fahim from giving statement in the court as he stops proceeding in the courtroom by sitting on the floor. The judge also sits on the floor, refusing to be swayed by Mathur's tactic.
At midnight, the Judge ignores his plea and decides to carry on the proceedings. After Fahim's statement Jolly with the help of police commissioner presents Quadri, who fakes his identity as a Brahmin Pandit. After the initial reluctance by the Judge, Jolly rapidly fires questions to Iqbal by asking him details of the Shastras. Iqbal finally breaks up and admits that he is the terrorist and had bribed Inspector Singh to set him free. Judge then declares Iqbal Qasim innocent and orders the arrest of the terrorist and gives life imprisonment to Suryaveer Singh along with his accomplices for charge of murder, erasing evidence, misleading court and showing false evidences and thus Jolly wins the case."

The Ghazi Attack,"The Indian Navy decodes a secret code sent from Pakistan to then-East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh) and intelligence report of a Pakistan Navy's submarine called PNS Ghazi, a much more advanced submarine than S21 or any other Indian submarine, being sent through the Bay of Bengal under the command of Cdr. Razak Khan (Rahul Singh). The top command dispatches S21, a submarine, under the command of Capt. Ranvijay Singh (Kay Kay Menon) for surveillance. To temper Singh's belligerent tendencies, the Indian Navy Admiral assigns Lt. Commander Arjun Varma (Rana Daggubati), with orders to ensure that Singh does not confront any Pakistani warships and trigger a war.
Ghazi blasts a merchant ship to divert attention of the Indian Navy, that has been sent to sink the sole Indian air-craft carrier, INS Vikrant. Arjun saves a girl child and a woman (Taapsee Pannu), who are Bangladeshi refugees. During surveillance, S21 acquires a sonar signal of Ghazi.
Singh believes that they should track down Ghazi and attack, while Arjun obstructs. Singh then orders the ship's XO, Santosh Devraj (Atul Kulkarni) to conduct a drill and target Ghazi while doing so. They miss their target narrowly and in the process alert Ghazi of their presence. Razak, orders his crew to head towards Visakhapatnam Port at full speed and to set up mines en-route so that S21 is destroyed in their pursuit.
S21 pursues Ghazi's path and realizes at the last moment that it is headed into mines. It tries to change its course but a mine explodes and damages most of the batteries, propellers and circuits and the compartment with the front torpedoes gets flooded. Singh dies while trying to save Arjun as S21 sinks to the sea-bed.
Meanwhile, Arjun, who by now is in charge of the mission, regroup and work towards reviving S21. The crew notices that the ship is incapable of moving in any direction, except up or down. Since they cannot chase Ghazi, the crew artificially triggers a one of the naval mines in its vicinity to make Ghazi return. Razak, sensing that Ghazi could be walking into a trap, diverts the ship's path and starts attacking S21.
Six torpedoes fired by Ghazi are avoided by S21 through depth changing maneuvers. S21 dives to 350m so that it is no longer within Ghazi's sonar range despite being designed for a maximum of 250m depth. With very limited battery support, Arjun instigates Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing 'Saare Jahaan se Achchha' and the Indian National Anthem. Riled up by S21's defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on S21, for which Ghazi will have to turn by 180 degrees. Arjun, dives into the flooded compartment to manually trigger the torpedoes and successfully triggers a torpedo. Ghazi also launches its torpedo at the same time. The Ghazi torpedo misses S21 narrowly, but it is hit by an S21 torpedo and disintegrates in water. Arjun is later saved alive from the flooded compartment."

Rangoon,"In 1943, as the Second World War rages on, India is fighting a combat of her own: independence from British rule. Subash Chandra Bose, founder of the Indian National Army (INA), has become disenchanted with Mahatma Gandhi's Ahimsa (non-violent) movement and desires to fight fire with fire. Recognizing the growing dominance of Imperial Japanese Army in the Indo-China region, the INA allies itself with the Japanese, hoping to ride the wave to Delhi. Indian troops in the British Indian Army are locked in pitched battles with both the INA and its Japanese contingent. In one such skirmish close to the Indo-Burma border, Jemadar Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor) and a group of fellow soldiers are cornered by the Japanese infantry. Running to escape on a barge, he is shot and captured as a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, the INA's top brass desperately seeks finances to replenish its heavy ammunition to aid the charge to Delhi.
Concurrently in India, Julia (Kangana Ranaut) a leading film star of the Indian cinema is the star performer of a dance troupe that entertains civilians and armed forces alike through films espousing her daredevilry. Zulfi (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) is her butler, make-up man, and trusted confidant. The films are produced by Rustom ""Rusi"" Billimoria (Saif Ali Khan), a former Indian action film star whose career was cut short when he lost a hand in a film stunt gone wrong. He is now Julia's mentor and the scion of a production house. Billimoria is on friendly terms with the resident British commander Major General David Harding (Richard McCabe), who encounters a gem-encrusted royal sword belonging to a Maharajah (Surendra Pal) at a gathering hosted by Billimoria. Slighted by the commander's arrogant demeanor, the King endeavors to send the sword to Indo-Burma border, where the INA hopes it can fund its artillery and drive the British out of India. An opportunity arises when Harding proposes dispatching Julia and her troupe to the war-torn border where he hopes to raise the sagging morale of his troops through her shows. When Billimoria and Julia (who are now in a relationship) object, Harding promises top-grade security and coerces them by threatening to block supplies of film stock from England, as Hitler-led Germany have stopped shipments. Billimoria's affair with Julia causes rifts in his family, with his wife demanding a divorce and his grandfather concocting a ruse to prevent Billimoria accompanying Julia on the tour.
On board the train, Jemadar Malik, who has apparently escaped as a prisoner of war, is assigned as security detail to Julia, much to her chagrin. Crossing a river, the full complement of passengers and boatmen come under fierce Japanese aerial attack, resulting in numerous casualties. The British assume Julia has fallen, but she has survived and is accosted by three Japanese soldiers. Malik, who has also escaped unscathed, arrives in time to save her from being killed and in the process, captures one Japanese soldier Hiromichi (Satoru Kawaguchi) as a hostage to lead them back to the Indian border. Through the rain-drenched jungle and a war-zone swarming with enemy platoons, Julia, Malik, and Hiromichi march slowly to their destination. Combing an anti-aircraft bunker, they barely escape a booby trap, with Malik furious at Hiromichi for leading them into an ambush. As Julia's gentleness and compassion counteracts against Malik's battle-hardened cynicism and aggression, the two fall in love, despite the overwhelming realization their journey will be over when Julia is reunited with Billimoria.
Back in India, Harding again proposes that Julia, now engaged to Billimoria, be dispatched to the front-lines, with anti-aircraft gun protection this time. Julia continues to exhibit feelings for Malik: she endorses him for the prestigious Victoria Cross medal and deliberately forces him to volunteer for a stage show. Billimoria begins to have suspicions about her behavior, which are confirmed after one surreptitious and passionate episode between Malik and Julia during an air-raid. Desiring vengeance, Billimoria volunteers as a stage hand on Julia's next show and after a tense routine, indirectly reveals that he is aware of her infidelity and ready to engage in a fight-to-the-finish with Malik. Meanwhile, Zulfi, who has also survived the earlier raid and is in reality a spy for the INA, has been entrusted to take the sword back to the INA by Mema (Lin Laishram), an INA agent in the British ranks, and Malik. It is then revealed that Malik did not escape his captivity in Rangoon but was freed by the INA who enlightened him about the evils of British rule in India, thereby enlisting him in the Gandhi regiment of the INA. Convinced of the cause and endowed with a fresh purpose, Malik clandestinely meets Julia before a show and delivers final instructions to Zulfi, who takes up a position outside her tent. Major Williams (Alex Avery) racially insults Zulfi after trying to forcibly enter Julia's tent to make her begin the show. Infuriated and inebriated, Zulfi hurls derogatory threats to the British on the radio during Julia's show. The outburst is heard by Billimoria, Harding, and other British soldiers, who rush to uncover the offensive culprit. Zulfi pleads guilty in Julia's presence on the stage but is shot dead by Williams, while Harding discovers Zulfi possessed a British Army officer's pistol. Distraught, Julia protests Billimoria's decision to not give Zulfi a proper burial as another member of Julia's troupe covertly abets Malik in a show of weapon check. As night falls, amid torrential downpour, Julia and Malik give Zulfi a proper burial, musing over loyalties and motivations.
During an attempt to arrange a rendezvous for transferring the sword with the INA via a letter, Malik and Mema are caught by Julia, who accuses Malik of betrayal. Torn between his feelings for her and his cause, Malik retorts by saying Julia is blinded by what she sees and the truth is lost on her. The letter reaches the INA, but Mema is trapped by the British while relaying messages. Next day, Harding blackmails Mema into revealing her co-conspirators by threatening to kill her son, at which point Malik discloses his true allegiance. Singing the INA anthem, Malik marches up defiantly to Harding, who signals Williams to shoot Mema dead. Enraged at this callous attitude, Malik lunges at Williams, but is captured and tortured by his former comrades. Horrified at this sequence of events, Julia turns a new leaf: she extracts Malik from a train bound for Delhi and resumes Zulfi's journey in getting the sword to the INA. At the bridge where the sword is to be handed over, Malik and Julia are cornered by the British. Malik convinces Julia to cross the bridge by covering her. In the ensuing gunfight, Malik is seriously injured by mortar fire while Billimoria arrives with British reinforcements. Harding tries to dissuade Julia from crossing the bridge with another false promise, but the mortally-wounded Malik defies him by walking across the bridge and sacrifices his own life so that Julia can continue. Harding orders the bridge be blown up, causing grave injuries to Julia. Seeking to redeem himself, Billimoria asks Julia for her last wish, who appeals that he continue her task of delivering the sword to the INA before falling to her death. Unsheathing the shining sword, Billimoria massacres the rest of the British troops on the bridge, decapitates Harding, and delivers the sword to the INA. The film ends by proclaiming the INA raised the Indian flag in 1944."

Badrinath Ki Dulhania,"Badrinath ""Badri"" Bansal (Varun Dhawan) is the younger son of a wealthy family in Jhansi. In a flashback, it is shown that Badri's elder brother, Aloknath ""Alok"" Bansal (Yash Sinha) was in love with a girl and was going to leave the family for her because their father disapproved, but decided against it after their father Ambarnath ""Ambar"" Bansal's (Rituraj Singh) first heart attack. Now Alok is married to Urmila Shukla (Swetha Basu Prasad) through an arranged marriage and she is not allowed to work despite being very intelligent and professionally trained, more than Alok himself. Alok is also depressed at having to leave his love and be forced into a marriage, so he spends a lot of time drinking. Badri fears the same fate for himself so when he sees Vaidehi Trivedi (Alia Bhatt) at a wedding supposedly being looked after by her father Mayank (Swanand Kirkire), he becomes obsessed with her and makes it his mission to marry her with Ambar's approval.
Vaidehi is also clearly more intelligent than Badri. She has a full education and is secretly training to become a flight attendant while Badri only passed the tenth grade. She's initially uninterested in getting married and is even offended by his marriage proposal. But when Badri helps Vaidehi's elder sister, Kritika (Sukhmani Lamba) find a husband in Bhushan Mishra (Aparshakti Khurana) and even resolves a dowry crisis with Bhushan's father Jitendra Mishra (Rajendra Sethi), Vaidehi agrees to marry him. On their wedding day, however, Vaidehi does not show up. Badri is heartbroken and Ambar is furious. He commands Badri to find Vaidehi and bring her back so that they can ""hang her from the ceiling."" Despite being afraid of Ambar's words, Badri goes to Mumbai to find Vaidehi, where he discovers that she's already moved to Singapore for a flight attendant training program.
Badri shows up on Vaidehi's doorstep in Singapore and kidnaps her. On the way, he pulls over and lets her out of the car trunk and they have an argument. Badri is furious at her for leaving him at the altar and she apologizes, trying to assure him that the reason she left was not because of him. Badri grabs her by the throat when a police car pulls up and takes them to the police station. At the police station, Vaidehi covers for Badri despite him having kidnapped her and attempted to choke her. Over the next few days, Badri stalks Vaidehi. Alok calls and tells him that Ambar has started looking for other brides. This terrifies Badri and he attempts entry into Vaidehi's workplace. She stops him and tells him she'll marry him only if he can convince Ambar to let her work and live in Singapore. Badri gets drunk that night and causes a scene outside Vaidehi's residential building and they have to go to the police again, where this time Vaidehi has to pay $1500 to bail him out.
Badri moves into Vaidehi's apartment where she cares for him by cooking for him before leaving for work every day, which humbles him. They spend time together with friends and tour Singapore together. Over time Badri begins to respect Vaidehi's independence and is impressed by her job and intelligence. He also remembers Urmila and feels sorry that she doesn't get to work. Badri and Vaidehi begin to spend more time together which causes them to grow closer. When Ambar calls, Badri lies and tells him that he didn't find Vaidehi. When Badri receives his passport back and leaves for India, Vaidehi starts to miss him and becomes depressed by his absence.
Back in Jhansi, Urmila is pregnant and Ambar holds a mega-pooja to ensure a boy is born. Badri feels sorry for her and misses Vaidehi at the same time, finally understanding why she ran away. Before the pooja, he gets heavily drunk and berates Ambar for being disrespectful to women. He blames Ambar for being the reason that he can't have Vaidehi when suddenly he sees Vaidehi from the corner of his eye. She tells him that she loves him and wants to marry him. Together they stand up to Ambar and tell him that they will get married and Vaidehi will work as she pleases regardless of whether he agrees or not.
In the epilogue, it is shown that Badri and Vaidehi maintain a long distance relationship while she finishes her training program in Singapore before moving back to India and starting her own flight attendant training center. Urmila gives birth to twins, one boy and girl, and it is shown that so far Ambar has been treating both of them equally. She also starts working in the family's car showroom with Alok and even gets her own cabin. Badri and Vaidehi promise not to collect any dowry for any of their children."

The lone security guard stationed at the building is unaware that Shaurya has moved in, and Noorie does not yet know Shaurya's new address.
The next morning Shaurya accidentally locks himself inside the apartment. He makes some initial attempts to break open the lock but fails. The apartment has faulty wiring which leads to the circuit getting tripped, leaving him without electricity. His phone runs out of battery power before he can call for help. Shaurya, now totally disconnected from the outside world, struggles to survive without food, water and electricity. As the days pass by, he becomes progressively more claustrophobic, and his attempts to escape become more desperate.

The house's resident, Swati, questions the clueless watchman about it, who claims that the building is empty. She hesitantly starts to go up to investigate but soon gives up.
Desperate for food, Shaurya resorts to eating cockroaches, ants and pigeons and also starts talking to a rat for company. To his relief, it rains heavily after some days, and Shaurya collects as much water as possible in empty containers. He manages to survive for almost a week, but his health deteriorates due to starvation, dehydration and isolation. In a final, desperate attempt to escape, Shaurya begins sawing through the balcony gate with a metal sheet, and ultimately succeeds. He climbs down five floors, almost falling off many times due to exhaustion, before managing to reach a floor which has no balcony gates and finally escapes the building. Fainting due to weakness and fatigue, he is rushed to the hospital. A week later, he is visited by Noorie, who reveals that she is now married since she thought that he had abandoned her.

Phillauri,"A young man Kanan (Suraj Sharma) returns to India from Canada to marry his long-term girlfriend Anu (Mehreen Pirzada), but comes to know that as he is a manglik (born under an unlucky star) he has to get married to a tree before getting married to her. He reluctantly marries the tree, which is duly chopped down after the completion of the ceremony. As a result, from that day onwards he is haunted by the spirit of a woman named Shashi (Anushka Sharma), who lived in that particular tree and hence claims to now be 'married' to him.
The story of Phillauri and Shashi is slowly revealed via the latter's flashbacks. Back in an unspecified time period, Shashi is a bright young woman who never fails to read the works of a poet named Phillauri that is regularly published in a local weekly. Everyone in the village of Phillaur thinks that the poems are written by the singer Roop Lal 'Phillauri' (Diljit Dosanjh), who is the heart-throb of the village. However Roop Lal notices that Shashi, unlike all the other village girls, never comes to hear him sing. When he confronts her one-day and tells her that he is the Phillauri who writes the poetry by narrating one of his famous poems to her, he is shocked when Shashi slaps and insults him. She asks him to use his talent – of being able to connect with the common man through his songs – for something important (especially when the struggle for independence is on) and not for frivolous matters. From that day onwards Roop Lal is a changed man, dedicating his life to knowing and understanding the poetry of Phillauri (which it is clear now that he is not the author of), and spreading its message via his beautiful singing to others.
On one particular night while Roop Lal is alone at home singing one of Phillauri's poems, Shashi comes to him and reveals that she is the one who writes poetry under the pseudonym of 'Phillauri' (which she can't do openly, being a woman). Subsequently, love blossoms between the two (the poet and the singer who translates her poetry to song and spreads its message far and wide), but Shashi's elder brother (a reputed doctor of the village who brought her up) eventually comes to know about the affair and intervenes between the lovers. Roop Lal confronts Shashi's brother and admits to having been an alcohol-addicted good-for-nothing who still is not worthy of her, but tells him that he (Roop Lal) is going to Amritsar to record all the songs written by Shashi and will eventually return and ask for her hand in marriage.
The very fact that Shashi writes poetry is a revelation to her brother, and as time passes he too reads the poems and starts appreciating her obvious talent. Meanwhile, Roop Lal records the songs in Amritsar (the gramophone record is credited to Roop Lal 'Phillauri', thus being an amalgam of his name and her pseudonym) and is paid a handsome fee of three hundred rupees. He immediately sends the entire amount as a money order to Shashi's brother, along with a letter stating his intention to return and marry her on Baisakhi. Shashi's brother, by now convinced of Roop Lal's changed nature and good intentions as well as the deep love between the couple, starts the preparations for her marriage.
On the day of the wedding Shashi comes to know that she is pregnant, but does not disclose the news to anyone except her close friend Amrit (Nidhi Bisht). She expectantly waits for Roop Lal along with all her relatives and the entire village, but eventually the day ends with him nowhere to be seen on any of the buses from Amritsar. Her brother has to face the intense embarrassment and shame of sending everyone away, and this in turn hurts Shashi so much that she commits suicide (by hanging herself from a tree) due to an overwhelming sense of sadness, despair and betrayal.
In the midst of all these flashbacks by Shashi's spirit the parallel storyline in the present continues with Kanan (whose confused ramblings about seeing a ghost naturally no-one believes), ending up in trouble with Anu who feels that he is not really interested in marrying her (which is partially true since he is getting cold feet). In order to clear the misunderstanding Shashi finally manages to reveal her presence to Anu as well (though Anu still cannot see her), and having heard her entire painful story Anu realises that Shashi's spirit is in fact still stuck on the mortal plane due to her unfulfilled love. At that point Anu's grandmother happens to play her favourite record, which as fate would have it is the one Roop Lal recorded. The record label mentions the recording date as 13 April 1919, which results in an epiphany for Kanan who immediately takes Anu (with Shashi in tow) to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which took place on that very day 98 years ago.
The movie ends with Shashi's spirit reuniting finally with her lover Roop Lal's (who was indeed killed in the massacre on the very Baisakhi day he recorded their songs and was to return to marry her). Before they both ascend to heaven Shashi tells Kanan and Anu (who can now see her) to love and cherish each other always, and that is what they promise each other as they embark on a new phase of their very own love story.[8]"

Begum Jaan,"In August 1947, after India sought independence from the British, the Last Viceroy of India, Mountbatten gave Cyril Radcliffe, the responsibility of dividing India into two parts - India and Pakistan. Radcliffe drew two lines - one in Punjab and another one in Bengal. This line was known as the Radcliffe Line.
Begum Jaan (Vidya Balan) is a prostitute who runs a brothel between the cities of Sakkergarh and Dorangla. The prostitutes in Begum Jaan's brothel are a number of girls she raised herself, who were either abandoned or disowned by their families and now work for her. The members of the brothel include an elderly woman known as Amma (Ila Arun), Sujeet (Pitobash Tripathy), a local worker who brings her customers and Salim (Sumit Nijhawan), a gunman who guards them and also two dogs. They are pestered by government officers Hari Prasad (Ashish Vidyarthi), Iliyas Khan (Rajit Kapoor) and Inspector Shyam Singh (Rajesh Sharma) who visit her and ask all of the residents to evict the brothel, as it lies on the land that the Radcliffe Line is to pass through. Love is shown to blossom between Sujeet and Rubina (Gauhar Khan). Begum Jaan's brothel is looked after by Raja Saab (Naseeruddin Shah), under whose protection, they are safe and sound. He pays their taxes and duties. Begum Jaan sends message to him for his help in this matter. He arrives at the brothel with gifts and presents for them and after hearing about their plight, he assures them of help by stating that he would be going to Delhi soon and discuss the matter there. However, he demands to spend the night with young Shabnam (Mishti Chakraborty), who had recently joined the brothel as a mental wreck after abuse. Begum Jaan reluctantly forces Shabnam to sleep with Raja Saab while she sings in the sidelines as he enjoys his night.
After several failed attempts to convince Begum Jaan and her team to leave despite giving them a month's notice, as a last resort, Hari and Iliyas, enlist the help of Kabir (Chunky Pandey), an infamous killer in Sonapur, to threaten Begum with her members to vacate the brothel. Raja Saab returns to the brothel one day to inform Begum Jaan that his efforts to save her brothel have failed and now she must vacate the brothel. Begum, who was having hopes from Raja Saab is shocked in dismay. Still, she stubbornly tells Raja Saab come what may, she'll rather die in her house like a queen than die on the streets like a beggar. Kabir proceeds to kill Begum's beloved dogs, even feeding their meat to Begum and her girls. He then kills Sujeet while he is returning from the market with a few other girls of the brothel. He persuades the girls to escape while sacrificing his life. This killing enrages Begum Jaan and her members further. As a result of Kabir's intimidation tactics, Begum asks Salim to train every one of her girls to use weapons and fight back. Intensive training practice sessions are held.
Meanwhile, Masterji (Vivek Mushran), Laadli's teacher, is in love with Begum Jaan and proposes to her, unaware that another prostitute named Gulabo (Pallavi Sharda), harbors feelings for him as well. Begum Jaan rejects his proposal and asks him to leave, leading an irate Master to concoct a plan to kill her. He convinces Gulabo to run away from the brothel, betraying Begum Jaan. Gulabo does so but Masterji spurns her and gets her raped by his accomplices inside a horse carriage. She vows vengeance.
That same night, Kabir and his men attack the brothel. Begum and the girls fight back but to no avail. Gulabo returns back and later slits Masterji's throat, while he is witnessing the attack on the brothel by Kabir and his goons. However, she has been badly assaulted by Masterji's accomplices and dies. The goons throw lighted torches inside the brothel, causing the building to be engulfed in flames. Begum Jaan and her girls put up a determined fight. Many are killed. She and her four surviving members smile while looking at their home being set ablaze; they walk inside the building and shut the doors. They burn to death as Amma narrates the story of Rani Padmavati of Chittorgarh, who refused to fall into the hands of the enemy and instead martyred herself and died a valiant death, just like the plight of Begum Jaan.
As the movie ends, Illiyas, Hari Prasad and Shyam Singh are seen to be remorseful of their actions; Illiyas shoots himself and we are shown the remains of the brothel and the end to Begum Jaan's legacy."

Sarkar 3,"A businessman named Deven Gandhi (Bajrangbali Singh) approaches Subhash Nagre ""Sarkar"" (Amitabh Bachchan) for a real estate project over a large slum in Daravi Mumbai. Sarkar suggests that Gandhi should offer appropriate compensation and relocate the slum dwellers. Gandhi deems that too expensive and would rather offer a smaller commission to Sarkar to force the relocation. Sarkar refuses and, when Gandhi insists that he will go to another power bastion, Sarkar asserts that he will not let Gandhi go ahead. Gandhi reports back to his Dubai based boss Vallya (Jackie Shroff). They join hands with a rival opposition leader named Govind Deshpande (Manoj Bajpai) and plot to oust Sarkar.
Sarkar’s wife (Supriya Pathak) pleads with him to permit Shivaji ""Chiku"" (Amit Sadh) (the grandson) to join him. Sarkar hesitates: the boy is hot-headed and volatile like his father Vishnu, but ultimately lets him come. Chiku immediately clashes with Gokul (Sarkar’s longtime loyal right hand man) (Ronit Roy) over various matters including whether or not to eliminate Deshpande. It is implied that Chiku's girlfriend Annu (Yami Gautam) is using him to get to Sarkar because Sarkar had ordered the elimination of her father. Meanwhile Gandhi approaches Gokul with the proposition to help him or Chiku would become the next Sarkar and Gokul will remain a servant.
Deshpande plots with Gandhi and Vallya to instigate mill workers against Sarkar. Chiku is on the warpath to attack Deshpande. Sarkar tries to calculate who is behind everything. One day, Deshpande is hotly pursued and killed and Sarkar, who has long held a reputation for bumping off opposition, is blamed. Sarkar notes that whoever did this is determined and cunning and will stop at nothing. When assassins open fire on Sarkar at the Ganpati Visarjan festival, it becomes clear that Sarkar’s inner circle has been breached. Chiku shows Sarkar the video of Gandhi meeting Gokul and, separately, Gokul remonstrates and says that Chiku, used by the wily Annu and his own vengeance for his father, is behind everything. Sarkar expels Chiku whereupon Chiku joins Gandhi.
Vallya orders a bomb blast at the mill. Gokul rightly reports that it was executed by Chiku (who is now out to destroy Sarkar) and Gandhi. Around this time Sarkar’s wife passes away. Gokul beseeches Sarkar to give the order to kill Chiku. Chiku is fired upon but he escapes. Gokul begins hunting him down.
Soon, Gokul is shot dead (presumably by Chiku) and Sarkar swears revenge on Chiku. Vallya arrives in India and meets Sarkar. He points out that Chiku is too inexperienced to become Sarkar and is therefore useless, and offers to help Sarkar eliminate Chiku. Sarkar discloses that Chiku was dispatched to infiltrate Gandhi by Sarkar himself. Differences with Annu had been cleared and she too was taken into confidence. Gokul had turned to Gandhi and played a part in the mill agitation and in the slum development so as to sideline Chiku and eventually become Sarkar. The objective of this plan was to draw out Vallya. Chiku walks in at this point. There is a gunshot and Vallya is killed. With their adversaries now dead, Chiku and Sarkar sip tea while Sarkar educates the inexperienced Chiku on palace politics."

Dear Maya,"The film opens into the lives of teenage girls Ana and Ira, students at a convent (Catholic) school in Shimla. They are particularly close and divide their daytime between school and romance novels and boys and, occasionally, sleepovers. They are very intrigued by their reclusive middle-aged neighbor Maya Devi who lives alone in a large house (with her two dogs) and rarely goes out. Ana’s mother explains that Maya Devi lost her father early and lived in that house with her chacha (father’s brother) and mother. Maya Devi was, and still is, a beautiful girl but her chacha constantly thwarted her marriage (by berating her and chasing away suitors). This was because he stood to inherit her estate. In time he passed away and Maya resigned herself to a dreary and solitary life.
Ira devises a plan to write love letters to Maya. The girls hope that this prank may bring some light into Maya’s life. They write letters, vivid and touching and steamy, pretending to be a former suitor, now in Delhi, still pining for Maya. Ira takes the prank further by breaking into Maya’s house one evening to steal a photograph. This goes badly; Ira breaks her ankle, as does Maya’s maid; the girls are reprimanded and Ana is tasked with filling in for the maid until the maid recovers. During this time Ana gets a little closer to Maya. The letters still arrive and Ana observes that Maya becomes happier with each new letter.
One day Maya stuns everyone by announcing that she is selling the house and moving to Delhi to find the letter writer, her long lost suitor. Ana discovers, to her horror, that the letter which prompted the decision was written by Ira and had an explicit invitation. She runs to dissuade Maya but is unable to do so. She confides in her mother. Ana is reprimanded and sent away to boarding school, away from Ira. Ana leaves without saying goodbye to Ira and they never speak again. Ira is shattered.
Torn by the guilt of her prank, Ana makes it her mission to find Maya in Delhi. Over the next six years she sticks posters and makes phone calls and follows every lead to find Maya. She finds a boyfriend, Rahul, who ultimately proposes to her but she is unable to accept. She returns to Shimla to discuss this with her parents. Ira visits her but Ana is still angry and turns her away. Ira is profusely sorry and persists and ultimately accompanies Ana back to Delhi. Ana is still mad at Ira for her selfish and childish behaviour which likely destroyed Maya’s life, but Ira reveals that she, too, had fallen in love in Shimla, and had lost her love to a motor accident, and now, having lost love, is fully aware of the true consequences of her pranks. Ana forgives Ira and persuades Ira to transfer to a college in Delhi. But Ira decides to return to Shimla. As Ana bids goodbye to Ira on the train station she receives a phone call from Maya.
The girls hurry to meet Maya. To their astonishment they find her, bright and sparkling and happy, at the zoo garden. Maya reveals her story. She had arrived in Delhi and tried to trace the letter writer but found nothing. Instead, over time, she found that Delhi, and the world outside Shimla, was not so frightening after all. People were helpful and kind. And she eventually met a kind and charming man who owned a jewelry shop. In time she became close to this man, Ved, and they married. And today Maya is blissfully happy with her Ved. The letters changed her life and she tells them to say 'yes' to life. Ana and Ira are stunned. They joyfully hug Maya and she embraces them and invites them to call any time. The film ends as Ana accepts Rahul's proposal and Ira transfers to a college in Delhi."
Raabta,"Raabta opens with Raja Hussain Iqbal moving from Pakistan to Budapest for a job as a banker, along with his friend Hadi Ali. Hussain is shown to have been a fun-loving womanizer back home and continues this behaviour in Budapest. Alishba Jowdat a young woman, is haunted by mysterious nightmares of drowning to death. She lives by herself in Budapest and works as a chocolatier. Hussain happens upon Alishba's shop while on a date with a woman, but finds himself deeply attracted to Alishba. Though she initially rejects his advances, she eventually succumbs and sleeps with Hussain, revealing the next day that she actually has a boyfriend and what happened with Hussain was a mistake. Unwilling to let go of their connection, Hussain interrupts Alishba's date and shows her that she would rather be with him than with her boyfriend. Alishba's boyfriend angrily breaks up with her, and Hussain and Alishba start spending time together, growing close. One night, they go to a club with Hadi, where they happen upon an eccentric psychic who knows about Alishba's nightmares and tells her that the events of her previous life will repeat themselves, and only she can fix them. Alishba tearfully reveals to Hussain that she has a fear of water because her parents drowned after a car accident when she was two years old.
While trying to test their love a final time, Hussain and Alishba make a pact. Hussain flirts with multiple women, but Alishba finds herself strongly drawn to a young businessman Ahad Ali. Hussain reveals he has to leave for a business trip for a week and he and Alishba decide to see how they feel after a week's separation. If they still feel strongly about each other, they will start considering marriage. During Hussain's absence, Alishba gets to know Ahad better and confides in him about her nightmares. During one of their dinners, Ahad drugs Alishba and kidnaps her.
Alihsba wakes up and finds herself trapped in Alishba's isolated mansion on an island off the coast of Croatia. She demands that he let her go, but he refuses, saying that he spent his whole life looking for her. He explains that they were madly in love in a previous life, but were separated. He refuses to let this happen again. When she does not believe him, he shows her a collection of uncannily accurate paintings he made of her at various ages and says she will find the explanation for her nightmares. Thinking he is crazy, she attempts to escape but ends up falling into the ocean, which triggers her memories of her previous life.
Hundreds of years ago, Alishba was the warrior princess Saiba. She was in love with Kaabir (later Ahad) a fellow warrior from her tribe. Their kingdom was threatened by the Rajputs, led by a wise, old ruler. Ahad is severely wounded by the fierce Rajput warrior Jilaan (later Hussain), who gives Kaabir an ultimatum to surrender. Saiba challenges Jilaan, and they find themselves attracted to each other. Saiba accepts defeat, surrendering the kingdom to the Rajputs and herself to Jilaan. Kaabir attempts to take Saiba back, but she reveals that she and Jilaan have fallen in love. On their wedding night, a comet falls and the Rajput ruler, Raja Tajuddin Khan, realizes that this will be a fateful night. Kaabir ambushes Jilaan and Saiba, and murders Jilaan by wounding him and having him thrown in the ocean. Saiba jumps into the ocean to save him, but to no avail. When she herself dies in the water, Kaabir slits his own throat, killing himself. The Rajput ruler forebodes that these events will repeat.
However, this time, when Hussain shows up to get Alishba back, Alishba, convinced that Hussain loves her, decides to fight back against Ahad. When their previous lives' events repeat - Ahad throwing Hussain into the ocean - Hussain drags Ahad down with him and Ahad dies. Alishba jumps into the water and is able to save Hussain this time.
The film ends with Hussain humorously telling their children to not believe Alihsba if she tells them any far-fetched stories about reincarnation, implying that he is still oblivious to the fact that they had a past life."

At home, despite Devki's persistent and warm approach toward her, Arya remains frosty and distant, rebuffing her attempts to build a relationship.

Rehana decides to audition for her college's band and catches the attention of Dhruv (Shashank Arora), the band's drummer, only to be snubbed by popular girl Namrata. She decides to participate in the ongoing protest against the ban on jeans and openly expresses her opinion on the oppression of women.

In her attempts to confront Rahim about her job, Shireen discovers that he is cheating on her with a woman whom he meets regularly at a café. She watches as he treats the woman affectionately and she follows the woman to her home, where she subtly warns her to keep a distance from Rahim and introduces herself as his wife.

Arshad fervently kisses Leela when Manoj leaves to get snacks and promises that he will elope with her. Despite this, she attempts to get over him and tries to have sex with Manoj inside the car, who foils her attempt by proclaiming that he wishes to wait until their wedding night. While waiting for Leela, Manoj discovers her sex tape with Arshad and accuses her of cheating, thereby breaking off their engagement.
Rehana passionately kisses Dhruv, while police search for her and find her with Namrata's help. They reveal footage from the mall's security cameras, proving Rehana's theft and arrest her.

Usha decides to wear a sleeveless blouse and sari. She gets her armpits waxed with the help of Leela and gets her grey hair dyed black. She looks at herself in the mirror and feels young and eagerly wants to meet Jaspal. Usha spends some time with Jaspal, who eagerly searches for Komal and departs from Usha. He is bewildered when he tries to flirt with Komal and she responds by publicly shaming him. Jaspal realizes that Usha is ""Rosy"" when he finds her novel by the swimming pool and confronts her family members, accusing her of sexually exploiting him. They raid Usha's room and condemn her for ruining their reputation before they throw her erotic novels and swimsuit on the street as the neighbourhood watches.

Toilet: Ek Prem Katha,"In an Indian village a group of women go to a field, away from their village in the early hours of the day to defecate in the open, behind the cover of bushes. Keshav (Akshay Kumar) has to marry a black buffalo because his father (Panditji) is a very religious and superstitious priest, and he believes that his son's marriage to a black buffalo will help improve Keshav's fortune.
Keshav meets Jaya (Bhumi Pednekar), falls in love with her and eventually convinces her to marry him. However, Keshav's father is of the view that Keshav's horoscope is such that he can and should only marry a girl who has two thumbs on one of her hands. Since Jaya does not fulfil this requirement, Keshav has an artificial thumb made and gives it to Jaya who wears it as a ring on her thumb. Keshav's unsuspecting father agrees to their marriage.
On her first morning in Keshav's house, Jaya reluctantly goes to a field to defecate, but comes back agitated without defecating and complains about it to Keshav. Despite Keshav's repeated attempts to convince Jaya to give up her stubbornness about needing a toilet, Jaya remains steadfast. He makes a couple of temporary adjustments to solve the problem, first taking her to a neighbour's house who has a portable toilet for a bedridden elderly woman, and later in a train that has a 10-minute stop at the village railway station, without actually constructing a toilet in his house, but after a while, Jaya gets frustrated and leaves him to live at her parents' house.
After a futile attempt to convince his sarpanch and villagers to build toilets in the village, Keshav, with the help of Jaya, contacts the concerned regulatory authority, and starts the construction of a toilet in his front yard. When the construction is finished, Keshav's father and the sarpanch arrange to demolish the toilet while Keshav is still asleep. But Keshav wakes up before the toilet is completely destroyed and protects it from complete demolition.
Jaya now files for a divorce in the local court citing the unavailability of a toilet in her husband's house as the primary reason for seeking divorce. Due to its unique nature, the case gets a lot of media attention. Politicians and the concerned government departments spring into action to hasten the process of constructing toilets in Keshav's village. But Keshav's father remains steadfast on his decision to not have a toilet in his house, until one day, his mother, while going out to defecate, falls on the doorstep, injures her hip and cries vehemently that she can't possibly walk to the fields to defecate, and that she must use the toilet that Keshav constructed in the front yard. After much reluctance, Keshav's father gives in and helps his mother to the toilet. He then realises that a toilet is indeed a critical requirement within a household.
On the day of the hearing of the divorce case of Keshav and Jaya, the judge gets an official notice from the Chief Minister's office urging the judge to not grant their divorce as the construction of toilets in their village shall be started the very next day. The couple comes out together happily. Keshav's father apologises to Jaya for his foolish stubbornness. In the end credits, villagers are shown lining up to use mobile toilets outside their village while the construction of toilets throughout the village goes on."
Gurinder Chadha,"Lord Louis Mountbatten (Hugh Bonneville) arrives at Viceroy's House in Delhi in 1947 with his strong-willed wife Edwina (Gillian Anderson) and daughter Pamela. As the final Viceroy of India, he is in charge of overseeing the dissolution of the British Raj and the establishment of an independent Indian nation. Mountbatten attempts to mediate a disagreement between the two major Indian political leaders, Jawaharlal Nehru, who wants India to remain intact as one nation after independence, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who wishes to establish the separate Muslim state of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Mountbatten's newly-arrived valet Jeet (Manish Dayal) encounters the beautiful Alia (Huma Qureshi), whom he had fallen in love with previously. Alia continues to spurn Jeet because he is Hindu and she Muslim; she fears that she will disappoint her invalid father Ali (Om Puri).
With riots erupting across India, the British decide to accelerate the independence process. Mountbatten is intent upon a one-state solution, but with intensifying violence between Muslims and Hindus he reluctantly accepts the Partition of India. He is given only a couple months to carve out a separate state from the existing territory, with the help of an inexperienced English lawyer, Cyril Radcliffe (Simon Callow). Jeet continues to pursue Alia, until it is revealed that she has been betrothed since childhood to another man. The servants at Viceroy's House are forced to choose between staying in India or going to Pakistan.
Mountbatten is enraged to find that his Chief of Staff Lord Ismay (Michael Gambon), has been working covertly to draw the boundaries of Pakistan in order to create a buffer state between the Indian subcontinent and the Soviet Union. He realizes that he has been used as a pawn and the displacement of millions of people will result. Jeet is devastated to learn meanwhile that his entire family has been slaughtered in Punjab. Although Alia rejects her fiancé when he returns to claim her, she chooses to depart for Pakistan with her father. Days later Jeet reads in the newspaper that the night train she had boarded was attacked and everyone was killed. In anger he brandishes a knife at Mountbatten, before resigning his post.
With Delhi overwhelmed with refugees, the Mountbattens decide to stay on in India to assist where they can. While Jeet volunteers to help with the refugees, Alia is brought in badly injured but alive, the lone survivor of the train attack. She recognizes Jeet and shouts for him, and the two are reunited."
Bareilly Ki Barfi,"Bitti (Kriti Sanon) is a young contemporary girl in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, who works in the complaint department of the local electricity board and is the apple of her father's eye. Like most Indian mothers, Bitti's mother wants to see her daughter get married to a nice man from a good family. Bitti, however, wants a husband who understands her and, more importantly, who accepts her exactly the way she is. A suitor comes but after knowing his disgusting mindset, she lies about not being a virgin and gets rejected. Her mother gets irritated with the constant rejections, but her father understands her. She gets heartbroken after hearing her parents conversation and later pours her heart out before her father who consoles and cheers her.
That night, despite having nowhere to go, she leaves her house and boards a train. While on a train platform, she chances upon a book at a bookstall and buys it. As she reads the novel entitles Bareilly Ki Barfi, Bitti starts to identify with the protagonist. Having found acceptance in the pages of the book, she decides to return home the same night. She longs to meet the writer and thus one day decides to search for the supposed writer of the book, Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkummar Rao). She goes back to the same bookstall where she had brought that book and asks about its writer. The bookshop owner directs her to Chirag Dubey (Ayushmann Khurana), who owns a printing press and who helped publish the book.
What Bitti doesn't know is that Chirag is in fact the true author of the book. He had written that book five years previously, after undergoing pain when his girlfriend ditched him and married someone else. He wrote that book describing his girlfriend Bubbly and their love story. Since giving his own name as the writer might destroy his ex-girlfriend's reputation, he coaxes one of his meek, so-called friend ""Pritam Vidrohi"" to have his name as the writer of the book. Vidrohi agrees but gets so scared of the possible future scenarios, that he leaves the city without telling anyone. He need not have been so worried, because in the five years since the book had been self-published by Chirag, not a single copy had ever been sold, except the copy that Bitti had purchased on the railway platform that day.
Bitti tries to get Vidrohi's whereabouts from Chirag but Chirag successfully manages to convince her to write letters to the author instead of meeting him personally. She writes a letter to Vidrohi for Chirag to pass on to him. Chirag, being the true author, writes back and passes it off as Vidrohi's response. Thus begins a correspondence between Bitti and 'Vidrohi'. In the meantime, Chirag and Bitti get to know each other better and become good friends. Bitti, however, starts to lose patience when Vidrohi, despite her repeated requests, refuses to meet her. She broaches this with Chirag and implores him to arrange for her to meet Vidrohi just once. Chirag agrees and as he has fallen for Bitti and decides to tell her the truth, that he is the actual writer. But later he learns that Bitti's mother hates that writer for spoiling their daughter's mind and thus decides not to tell the truth, instead search for Vidrohi and make him the scapegoat.
Chirag visits Lucknow, where Vidrohi works as a salesman in a saree showroom, and convinces him to act like a boor, with a bad & short-tempered attitude, so that Bitti will be cured of her long-distance infatuation. Thus, at first meeting with Bitti, Vidrohi, as instructed, pretends to be a rude and boorish person, causing Bitti to get annoyed leave. Strangely, for no apparent reason, Bitti and her family start showing interest in Vidrohi after this incident, and Vidrohi seems to be happy at all the respect and attention he is getting. This causes a rift between him and Chirag, to the point that they nearly come to blows and Vidrohi insultingly tells Chirag that he will take away Chirag's girl with a snap of his fingers. Sure enough, only a few days later, Vidrohi, now all sly smiiles and false warmth, visits Chirag and jeeringly invited him to attend his wedding engagement with Bitti. He also requests Chirag, a talented writer, to write a speech for him (Vidrohi) to deliver on the occasion. A heartbroken Chirag goes to Bitti to tell her the truth, but is unable to say anything to her after seeing how happy she is. He writes some lines for Bitti on behalf of Vidrohi and asks him to recite those lines at the engagement.
On the day of engagement, Vidrohi says he has a sore throat asks Chirag to recite those lines for Bitti. Chirag begins to recite the lines, but his emotions overcome him and he begins to weep. Bitti then confidently swaggers up to him and informs him that she will marry him and not Vidrohi. It is revealed that Vidrohi had coincidentally bumped into Bitti at a local market a few hours before they were supposed to have their first meeting. Vidrohi had told the truth to Bitti, about how Chirag wanted him to behave like a boor, so that she would be repelled by his behavior. Bitti had got an idea—let Vidrohi behave like a boor, but later let Vidrohi and Bitti pretend to be in love with each other, and let that be a test of Chirag's ""good behavior"" to see if he really loved Bitti or not. Apparently, he had 'passed' by placing her happiness above his own, even if (inexplicably) her 'happiness' was in fact based on a humungous falsehood—that Vidrohi was a talented and sensitive writer, which he in fact was not; he was a salesman in a saree shop.
Finally in the last scene, all are seen enjoying with narrator asking viewers to taste this 'barfi' if they ever visit Bareilly."
A Gentleman,"Gaurav Kapoor (Sidharth Malhotra),based in suburban Miami, plans to get hitched to his colleague Kavya (Jacqueline Fernandez), who happens to be the woman of his dreams, but she prefers a man who is more adventurous and risk-loving. Parallel to the same runs the story of clandestine spy Rishi Purohit (Sidharth Malhotra), who is seen to have been trying to extract some crucial substance from the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok. However, when a co-spy, Yakub (Darshan Kumaar), shoots down an innocent civilian, the dishonest move enrages Rishi. Nonetheless, he returns to Mumbai, where it is revealed that he works for Unit X, a spy organisation headed by Colonel Vijay Saxena (Suniel Shetty). Rishi explains to Col. Vijay that he can't continue with such routines, and that he wants to start life afresh. Col. Vijay asks him to perform one last job for him, and this involves spying on a minister who Col. Vijay claims to be corrupted and wants to blackmail, and copying data from his cellphone into a hard drive which is wanted by Col. Vijay. Rishi does save contents into the hard drive, but Col. Vijay, thinking that Rishi is useless, instructs Yakub through a text message to kill him. However, Rishi senses the suspicion, and fights off Yakub and other co-spies. Yakub manages to shoot him, but Rishi disappears.
Gaurav, in the meantime, tries to hang out with Kavya on a date, and also meets her parents, who consider getting him married to Kavya. Meanwhile, he is ordered by his boss to visit Mumbai to crack a business consignment. Rewinding to Rishi's life, it is shown that he is intercepted by some security officers, one of whom happens to be a man named Gaurav Kapoor, who works in a cyber firm in Mumbai, and has important data about the minister's connections. Rishi decides to move away, and impersonates Gaurav, who has been killed in an accident. A chain of events soon ends up revealing that Gaurav is in fact Rishi himself, and that he switched to Gaurav's identity to live a peaceful life and have a decent yet beautiful family.
Gaurav is soon attacked by some goons who happen to be potential sleeper agents for Unit X, and hides the body of one of them in his car, which is noticed by his friend Dixit, who tries to bail him out of the trouble that ensues. Finally, Yakub and other Unit X agents track Gaurav down, and confront him, where he finally confesses, as Rishi, that he needed a life, but he is knocked down unconscious, and soon finds himself tied to the floor with Kavya. However, Gaurav uses his skills to evict Kavya from the trouble, and succeeds eventually, but ultimately ends up confessing to her that he is a retired spy officer. Kavya berates him, but takes pity on him when she notices blood wounds over his stomach. The two share a kiss and soon find themselves under fire after Unit X agents, headed by Yakub, raid the hotel they are staying in. Rishi hatches a quick scheme to retrieve the data, since the hard drive is damaged, and convinces Yakub that it would be their very last mission.
Rishi executes the heist with success, but security officers take notice of it all and begin chasing Rishi, and Yakub backfires on him by aborting the operation. They meet at Rishi's House, where Rishi kills most of Yakub's henchmen with the help of Kavya. However, Rishi spares Yakub and two of his thugs and orders him to leave in his car. Yakub soon realizes that the hard drive Rishi sent is void, and the car dickey contains the corpse of Koko, the henchman sent earlier by Jignesh to kidnap Rishi. They end up being confronted by local Police after an overspeeding Dixit wrecks their car in a side collision, whereupon they discover the corpse and Yakub and his thugs are killed by the cops as they open fire. Col. Vijay raids his hideout, but is killed in a premeditated explosion planned by Rishi. This renders Unit X futile, and Rishi and Kavya soon head on as Hemant and Pooja Khanna, a rank couple whose passports are stolen by Rishi.
A mid-credit scene shows Gaurav's friend, Dixit, buying some machine guns from a local gun store in Miami, before putting on a hoodie and walking away."

Simran,"Praful Patel (Kangana Ranaut) is a young divorcee who lives with her parents and works in the housekeeping department in one of the five star hotels of Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
She shares a bitter relationship with her dad who is always blaming her for her mistakes in the past, instead of giving her moral support; so now, Praful wants to move out and buy her own house.
She has applied for a loan and her loan gets pre-approved. In the meantime, Praful decides to go with her cousin on a trip to Las Vegas (her cousin pays for all tickets and accommodations).
In Las Vegas, she plays baccarat for the first time and wins big in her first few rounds. She quickly gets addicted to the game. The next day, she returns to the casino, but ends up losing not only the money she won the previous day, but a large chunk of her savings also.
Praful then returns to Atlanta after a week, only to find out that her bank application to the bank has been rejected as her credit rating is very low. Praful seeks her father's help but he insists that she should meet a young man named Sameer (Sohum Shah) who has been selected as her suitor.
After meeting with the suitor, she has mixed feelings about marriage and agrees to get engaged. However, her addiction to gambling takes a toll on her and Praful gives her last shot to gambling and goes back to Vegas.
Unfortunately, she ultimately loses all her savings so a private money lender spots Praful (who is now drunk) in the casino and offers her money. The drunk Praful - not in her right senses- takes $32,000 from the money lender and in exchange gives him her driving license.
Praful loses all that borrowed money (along with her hard-earned savings) and has to return penniless to her home.
Praful tries to explain to her father her bad situation and needing his financial help, but in fear of retaliation and hostility she is reluctant. Her parents want her to begin her wedding preparations and plans with Sameer, who by now gets impressed by her personality.
At a relative's wedding Praful and Sameer meet again and dance, and get to know each other. However, Praful is threatened by the loan sharks to pay within 10 days or face death, so she is disturbed and anxious, unable to concentrate on her wedding plans.
Therefore, Praful develops the habit of stealing whereby first she disguises herself (wearing oversized sunglasses and a hood) and approaches a cashier at a gas station shop. She collects only $10,000 so she has to go and rob a bank (which she learns how to on YouTube), with a disguise, and hands a note written with red lipstick that says money should be given to her otherwise she will blow the whole bank as she is strapped to a bomb.
Praful's second robbery gets foiled by a bank manager who bumps into her when she tries to rob the bank in the similar fashion. When the manager asks her name, Praful tells her name 'Simran', the name of a popular character from an Indian blockbuster film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which her mother ultimately watches often.
Although Praful's plan to rob the bank gets foiled, she manages to escape and robs another bank in the similar manner.
Praful Patel has now become a most wanted criminal with the name 'Simran - The Lipstick Bandit'. Despite robbing 3 to 4 banks successfully, Praful is still short of collecting fifty thousand dollars.
Meanwhile, Praful develops a liking towards Sameer, and confides in him her bad habits of gambling and stealing which he does not take seriously, thinking it is some kind of a joke. Trouble comes back when loan sharks attack Praful in her hotel for money and Praful's ex-boyfriend Mike - the general manager of the hotel, steals the money from her locker room and refuses to give the money back to her until and unless she submits to his sexual advances/desires.
Praful ultimately hits him and gets suspended from the hotel, after which she tells the loan sharks that her money has been stolen. By now, these loan sharks know that Praful is actually 'Simran - The Lipstick Bandit', so they ask her to rob one more bank and this time with a bigger amount-- for which they offer her a gun to finish the job.
Devastated and dejected, Praful calls off her relationship with Sameer and asks him to leave and by telling him the truth. Enraged by this, Praful's father slaps her and asks her to leave his house.
Praful leaves her home and stays with her best friend Salma for a night. The next day Praful attacks the same bank that rejected her bank loan and flees the place after stealing the money.
Sameer is still in love with Praful and in order to help her, he transfers the huge amount of fifty thousand dollars in her bank account.
Praful, before leaving the city of Atlanta, calls him at a lonely place and tells him that he should find another girl, as he is a nice man and he deserves someone better; not someone like her.
Sameer refuses and asks her to surrender to the police and end this dirty game once and for all; after which Praful's dad calls her and asks for forgiveness. Praful is happy at this and returns home but the police cars have surrounded her and are following her car to arrest her.
Praful drives off because she did not want to get arrested in her neighborhood, which is full of Indians, and her parents would be very ashamed of her there. The ultimate chase begins as Praful's car is found empty by the police. Praful had taken a taxi and was almost near the airport, but then she decides to surrender on a lonely highway. She asks the taxi to stop at the curbside and then she calls 9-1-1 and surrenders herself.
After her arrest, there is a trial whereby the judge adjudicates Praful to be imprisoned for 10 months, but she is released after 3–4 months due to good behavior. Her ex-boyfriend Mike is also imprisoned for stealing her money and also for his sexual advances (attempted rape/forcing himself on her).
During a meeting session in prison, Praful tells her father that she wants to invest all his money into stock market. Enraged by this, Praful's father becomes angry and grabs her neck angrily, venting his frustration that all his hard-earned money will blow up in smoke due to her crazy intentions.
The film ends with titles suggesting that Praful has been released from jail and she has sold the rights of her own movie to be made to a Bollywood producer for fifty thousand dollars."

Newton,"Newton Kumar, a rookie government clerk on reserve is sent on election duty to a Nicolette-Maoist insurgency Naxal-controlled town in the conflict-ridden jungles of India, when one of the main duty officers is found to be facing heart problems. Faced with the apathy of war-torn security forces and the looming fear of guerrilla attacks by communist rebels, he tries his best to conduct free and fair voting despite the odds stacked against him. He is disappointed when the voters do not turn up for the election. Later when a foreign reporter turns up at the polling station the security forces force the villagers from the constituency to turn up to cast their votes. When one of them enters the polling booth, he becomes bewildered with the voting machine and its operation.
After talking to the lot, soon Newton realizes that they have no idea what the election is about. Some thought they would earn money from this, while others asked hopelessly about getting paid sufficiently for their work. He desperately tries to educate them but to no avail. Taking the lead, the frustrated security head pushes him aside and shames the villagers by telling them that these officers have risked their lives for their vote, and they should not turn them away, and that the voting machine is a toy; there are symbols of elephants, cycles, etc. and they could press any symbol they like (leaving them uneducated about the fact that those symbols represent respective political parties). So while they vote their favourite symbol, instead of politicians they have never heard about, the foreign reporter gets a good news report about India's democracy.
Newton wants to sit at the polling booth for the stipulated time but is forced to flee due to a Naxal ambush which he realises later was staged by the forces. On gaining such knowledge, he tried to outrun his escort team back to the polling booth, but gets caught on both sides, and is forcefully taken back to safety. On the way back Newton decides to collect votes of four villagers who suddenly turn up from deep inside the forest. The Chief of Security is reluctant to let them do so. It is here where the film gives the viewer the conundrum of the situation in war torn areas, through two men without any rivalry, bent on their duty, yet a stark difference, exposing the conundrum of truth. Taking his duty very seriously, Newton steals the Chief's gun and holds the officer at gunpoint till the villagers cast their votes. The chief comments out of frustration that it was not his wish to conduct such polling here in an area secured 6 months ago, having more landmines than men. He tells that he doesn't want to lose more brave boys like they already have anymore, even when the government cannot even supply them night vision goggles they have been asking for 2 years. Newton keeps him at gunpoint even after the voting for the remaining two minutes of his official duty (till 3pm). The security forces then beat him up out of frustration.
The movie concludes with a shot of the area six months later, showing mining activity going on. The Chief of Security is shown shopping and indulging his wife and daughter over a bottle of olive oil, with the implication of the family facing a tough financial situation.[11] Newton is shown in his office keeping up with his old ways. He is visited by the local election officer Malko and they agree to have tea, but only after five minutes, when Newton's scheduled lunch break begins."

Golmaal Again,"The story starts with Anna Matthew (Tabu) explaining that she can see ghosts and spiritual spirits due to a special power given to her by the Gods and believes she has been chosen to help ghosts and fulfill their last wishes so that their spirits can achieve salvation. The story continues with Anna narrating one such incident of her life.
The story revolves around Gopal (Ajay Devgn), Madhav (Arshad Warsi), Lucky (Tusshar Kapoor), Laxman 1 (Shreyas Talpade) and Laxman 2 (Kunal Khemu, who are orphans living in an orphanage located in the picturesque Ooty, managed by the kind businessman Jamnadas (Uday Tikekar).
One night, Gopal, Madhav, Lucky and the two Laxmans find a baby girl at the gate of the orphanage. They name her Khushi and take care of her. The five boys also know Anna Matthew, who works in a library nearby. The boys are aware of Anna's power to see spirits from the other world. One day, Madhav pranks and scares the easily frightened Gopal in an empty bungalow, which leads to a fight between the two then young boys. Gopal gets punished and the five boys decide to leave the orphanage. Khushi is extremely upset with this as she is left behind. Khushi later gets adopted by a loving colonel and his wife.
Years later, Gopal and Laxman 1 are estranged from Madhav, Laxman 2 and Lucky. The five, however, are once again reunited when the news of Jamnadas's death comes and they are invited to an event to be held to honour him. They return to the orphanage after 25 years, finding that nothing much has changed. The five enter the old bungalow where Madhav had scared Gopal. There, they meet the colonel; they are also reunited with Anna Matthew (Tabu), and Pappi (Johnny Lever), another orphan from the orphanage. They also meet with Damini (Parineeti Chopra) whom Anna introduces as the bunglow's caretaker. Anna reacts strangely when she sees the boys acknowledging Damini's presence.
At the special event for Jamnadas, businessman Vasu Reddy (Prakash Raj) reveals that the orphanage's kids will be shifted somewhere else, while the orphanage in Ooty will be demolished. Soon, one by one, the boys get possessed by a ghost that talks in Nana Patekar's voice. This scares Gopal, so Anna suggests they stay in Colonel's house.
Madhav, Laxman 2 and Lucky are also staying in the Colonel's house, as they are handed over the job of getting Gopal and Laxman1 out of the house by Vasooli (Mukesh Tiwari) and Vasu Reddy. The five of them fight daily, exasperating Anna. The boys finally make amends after Lucky gets possessed. They push Gopal, who has fallen for Damini, to express his love to her. Just then, Pappi tells that the girl who they thought was Damini is actually dead and the real Damini is alive and is Pappi's Girlfriend. Terrified, they try to flee but Anna stops them and reveals that the ghost is of none other than their own Khushi, their childhood friend.
Khushi then tells her tale that how she had met a young businessman, Nikhil (Neil Nitin Mukesh), and fell in love with him. Their marriage was fixed. One night, however, she witnessed Nikhil killing Jamnadas as Jamnadas confronted Nikhil about the latter's conspiracy of obtaining the orphanage in his name on the pretext of benefitting the orphans, and instead, demolishing the orphanage and building a contruction site for his personal gain. Khushi then confronted Nikhil and threatens to go to the police and calls him a murderer. Nikhil then strangled Khushi to death. With Vasu Reddy's help, Nikhil proved Jamnadas' death and Khushi's death as accidents. Khushi came to Anna as a spirit, asking for help. Anna was surprised that the boys could see Khushi and took it as God's sign, which is why she brought the boys to the house to help her.
The boys plan to scare Vasu into confessing the truth but their plan is ruined when Nikhil returns and mocks that they don't have any evidence to prosecute him for the alleged crime. This infuriates Khushi, who brutally attacks Nikhil and almost kills him. Anna calms her down and Vasu Reddy convinces Nikhil to confess. In the end, the orphanage is saved and Khushi's spirit, now content, departs happily to heaven after bidding goodbye to the boys.
During the credits, the five dance with Khushi on a song."

Abhay Chopra,"Vikram (Sidharth Malhotra) is an acclaimed British writer of Indian descent. On the launch of his third book in Mumbai, he finds his wife Katherine dead in their hotel room. The police suspect him so he flees by car. As the cops give chase, his car overturns and he escapes with injuries, taking shelter in a nearby apartment. Maya (Sonakshi Sinha), a young housewife who lives there, spots a police car outside and rushes there for help.
The police find Vikram next to the body of her lawyer husband, Shekhar, who has been murdered. They also find burnt photographs in the trash. Dev Verma (Akshaye Khanna), an officer investigating the double murder, interrogates Vikram and Maya.
According to Vikram's account, he fled from the police because he feared he would be framed for his wife's murder. He found Maya at her door and asked for help. He added that his wife did not attend the book launch, as she was unwell and took medicines for a heart ailment. Vikram entered Maya's flat and said that she attempted to seduce him. Maya introduced Chirag, who entered her house saying he was her husband. When Vikram saw a framed photo and realized Chirag was not Maya's husband, Chirag struck him with a candle-holder and Vikram lost consciousness. Upon waking, he found Shekhar's body next to him.
According to Maya's account, she found an injured Vikram at her door, asking for help. She let him in only to find out from the news that the police are looking for him for the murder of his wife. Vikram whipped out a knife and overpowered her, and began searching for documents at Shekhar's desk when she turned a visiting Chirag away, who she confessed of having an extramarital affair with. Around midnight, her husband returned and struggled to free her from Vikram. Maya rushed outside to a police vehicle for help. By the time she returned, Vikram had killed her husband with a candle-holder.
Meanwhile, the police find that a gang rape victim named Sandhya committed suicide recently because Vikram’s third book had revealed her identity. Examination of Katherine's body reveals that she had died of a heart attack.
The forensic team informs Dev that Shekhar was attacked on the head by someone who was at least 6 feet tall. The police initially suspect Vikram as his height is 6’1”. However, it is found that the burnt photographs were those of Maya and Chirag, who is also about 6 feet tall. The photographs had been taken by a detective hired by Shekhar. The police eventually conclude that Vikram’s account is true and Maya and Chirag had killed Shekhar when he confronted them with the photos. Vikram is deemed innocent and released from custody. He cremates his wife’s body, and Maya and Chirag are arrested and charged with Shekhar’s murder.
At home, Dev is reading Vikram's second book when his wife Meera (Mandira Bedi) spoils that the protagonist dies of drug overdose. Dev rushes to the forensic doctor to check if Vikram's wife could have died from an overdose of the medicine she had been taking for her heart. They discover that the pills had been tampered with and the dose was made three times higher than normal, which caused Katherine to have a fatal heart attack.
Dev calls Vikram while the latter is about to catch a flight back to London. On the phone, Vikram confesses to having killed Katherine and Shekhar. He killed Katherine because she was threatening to charge him for the suicide of Sandhya. Shekhar was the lawyer working with her to file a case against him. He fled to Shekhar's house to destroy the legal documents of the case. When Maya went out to seek help, he killed her husband and stumbled across the photographs with her lover. He burnt them and threw them in the trash, creating a convincing story to dupe the police. He tells Dev that he has already cremated his wife's body; thus there is no evidence left. Dev decides to catch Vikram and punish him even if he has to take an illegal action to do so."

They then notice that a new family is moving into the next house. Krish is a neurosurgeon who specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS) to cure Parkinson's. He is close to another doctor, Dr. Prasad, who is a psychiatrist.
The two families get along well, with Jennifer aka Jenny, who is the eldest daughter having a crush on Krish. Everything goes well when suddenly during a dinner party, Krish sees Jenny jumping into the nearby well. Informing the family, he jumps into the well and saves her. Lakshmi who is angry at Krish for impulsively jumping into the deep well, quarrels with him that night before Krish forcefully kisses her and both end up having sex. That night, Jenny has seizures and once again, Krish helps her in time. During another dinner at Krish's house, Jenny panics after seeing a strange figure and her parents forcefully take her home. The people in the house start noticing strange things. The next morning, Jenny, once again not being self-aware, goes towards a cliff to jump. Sarah, who follows her, slips towards another cliff, but is saved by Krish.
When Paul goes towards Jenny to stop her, she herself returns home without saying anything, while still in a trance & passes out in the house. Her father then takes her to the psychiatrist on Krish's recommendation and she reveals two specific things that she thought was abnormal: a voice speaking to her in Chinese and another terrifying incident in the toilet. The psychiatrist feels that something is wrong and visits Jenny's room one day with the permission of her father who takes her out. He tries to decipher her mental state by reading the condition of her room, while also finding recent internet searches about ghosts in her tablet, and a book about exorcism lying in her drawer. Upon seeing this, he concludes that Jenny must've made up an image in her mind that she's possessed by a spirit. So, he, Krish, and Jenny's dad plan to administer fake exorcism with the help of a church pastor, Father Joshua in order to bind the spirit. All hell breaks loose in doing so, revealing that she is really possessed by a powerful spirit of the Chinese mother, resulting in Father Joshua getting injured and admitted to the hospital in a comatose state.
Jenny returns to a normal state, but to confirm what is going on, her grandfather calls on a psychic. But Jenny's father dismisses him. One night, the servant in the house prepares a voodoo doll to chase the bad spirit, but is scolded by Paul not to do occult in house. The same night, she is hit by the ghost in the same way as the voodoo doll, while being wrapped by her own shawl, impaled on the head by a nail. The next morning, when Paul looks around her room, he finds the Voodoo doll under the bed and what appears to be fingernail marks below the bed frame. Evidently spooked, he tells his father to call the psychic. Using his power, the psychic talks to the spirit, who signals to him that there are not two, but three spirits in the house, with the third one being revealed to actually be a malevolent force which would not let them leave the house.
Lakshmi announces that she is pregnant, but within a few days, she falls off a ladder, while seeing a scary figure on the water tank, who was actually attempting to cause her a miscarriage, but the child survives. Krish gets suspended as he was constantly distracted by these figures, while in the operation theater causing a hemorrhage to the patient being operated. Dr. Prasad, with the help of a local police inspector, starts researching about a family that used to live in that house finding out that there was an eye witness who knew what happened to the family. Simultaneously, the psychic too, using the comb which belonged to the Chinese daughter, begins to place the pieces of the mystery. When Dr. Prasad and Krish go to see the witness in a village, she tells a flashback when she was eight years old. It is revealed that the house belonged to a rich Chinese silk merchant who lived with his wife and daughter. He wished that his pregnant wife should bear a male child. As he was a Satan worshiper, he had to sacrifice a girl child during the time of the solar eclipse to get a male child.
To achieve this purpose, he kidnapped the then eight year old witness when she was collecting flowers in the garden nearby as usual. The eight year old was saved in time by his wife, which left him with no option, but to sacrifice his own daughter. He hit his wife, until she fell unconscious. Luring his daughter, he beheaded her using a sacrificial sword. His wife, regaining her consciousness, couldn't bear the sight of her dead daughter on the floor. Cursing her husband, she took a knife and pierced herself in the abdomen, killing herself and the unborn child, telling him that she does not need a male child by sacrificing a female child. The husband, realizing his loss, takes his own life by drowning in the nearby well.
Returning to the present, the father orders his family to pack up and leave the house. Lakshmi is being chased in the hospital by the two spirits only to guide her to Father Joshua’s room. Being the day of the solar eclipse, the old woman speculates that the Chinese merchant would return to complete his ritual. Lakshmi calls Krish and tells him that she is discharged and is headed to see Jenny. Krish too comes back from the village at the request of Lakshmi to stay with Jenny. Lakshmi then tricks Krish and locks him in Jenny's room for impeding him till the eclipse ends. She then reveals what Father Joshua had seen on the day of exorcism. Though Jenny was set free, some other force tried to stop the prayers of Father Joshua in the room. The force was from none other than Krish. When Krish had jumped into the well the other night to save Jenny, the Chinese merchant’s spirit possessed him. Meanwhile, the psychiatrist being in the same room as Krish also figures that the Chinese merchant and Krish have common dates of birth. Krish being possessed, kills the psychiatrist in a gruesome way and escapes through the window.
It was from Krish that the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter were trying to protect the family by frightening them to leave the house. As the eclipse begins, the spirit of the Chinese merchant takes full control of Krish and he begins searching for his target, which is revealed to be Sarah, to sacrifice and complete the ritual. Though he lures her and tries to kill her, the family members and the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter fight with Krish by trying to distract him, until the eclipse ends and they finally succeed in removing the spirit from his body.
In the end, Krish and Lakshmi are shown to be settled in Goa. Jenny, along with her dad comes to meet them. When Jenny requests to meet their son, it is revealed to the viewers that Krish, being possessed by the Chinese merchant’s spirit had sex with Lakshmi resulting in a baby actually born of the Chinese merchant instead, which the couple is unaware of. The film ends with the camera panning towards the boy seated in a room, slowly revealing his face & focusing on the iris of his eye, which splits into double iris and the screen cuts to black."

Tumhari Sulu,"Sulochana Dubey, nicknamed Sulu, is a middle-class housewife staying in Virar with her family. Sulu enjoys her life to the fullest with her husband and 11-year-old son. She dreams of being a working woman, but since she couldn't complete her high school she cannot think of any white collar jobs. Her two elder twin sisters are always critical of her educational credentials and mock her failed business ideas.
Sulu is fond of participating and winning any contest around her, be it a singing competition or an athletic event or a lemon and spoon race.
Her husband, Ashok works as a manager in a tailoring firm, which is quite a frustrating job since everyone apart from him is over the age of sixty, including the owners. Most of them are either unresponsive or unreasonable. On top of it, the firm now is taken over by the grandson of the owner, who is very rude and treats him with disdain. Ashok bears all this for his family. Her son is constantly teased by a set of students, who sell magazines, CDs, etc., in school, which is strictly prohibited.
One fine day, Sulu wins a contest hosted by her favourite radio station. She receives a call from Albeli, the top RJ of the radio station. On the call, Albeli makes her sing. Sulu sings a retro song, which everyone at the radio station finds funny. Next day she goes to the Radio station to collect her prize. There she sees a poster of auditions for the position of a RJ. She is very excited and feels that this is the job she is waiting for. She insists on filling the form, which the receptionist refuses on some pretext or the other. Co-incidentally, RJ Albeli walks in and feels that she must give her a shot. She takes Sulu to meet her boss, Maria. Sulu is extrovert and engaging, which is a bit annoying for others but Maria finds her interesting. She gives her an opportunity to audition. At the audition, Sulu is very casual and not able to control her laughter after Pankaj, one of the poets at the radio station, recites the lines in a sensual manner. Just at the end, she manages to say 'Hello' in a sensual manner, which impresses Maria. Maria gives her card and asks if she would be able to do a call-in night show - where people would call her to talk about their troubles. Maria gives Sulu time to think.
Sulu thinks about the job and the sensual accent in which she would have to answer the calls. Just to try out, she calls a nearby grocery store, talks in a sensual accent and requests the owner to get a broom. The owner excitingly comes to the address, only to find out that the floor does not exist. Next, she calls her husband and drives him mad.
Next day, she calls Maria multiple times to tell that she is ready to take up the job. As it happens, Maria is in a very difficult situation and is not able to receive any of her calls. Sulu is disappointed and sends a few messages indicating that she is ready to work. Next day, Maria realizes the passion behind Sulu's persistent annoyance and hires her. To start with, Ashok is annoyed with her that she took up the job without discussing with him but later relents out of his love for her.
The company provides Sulu pickup and drop facility. On her first day, Sulu faces an annoying caller who tries to change their chat into an obscene one. With her sharp mind, Sulu is able to tactfully handle it. Next, she gets a request from a caller to sing an out of the world kind of a song for him. Sulu, out of excitement, sings a song which she sings only for her husband. Ashok is annoyed by all this, as well as frustrated with his new boss who treats him rudely. Because of these two situations, he becomes angry and, at times, insecure.
Sulu's parents and her sisters are very angry with her program and force her to quit the job. But Ashok stands by her and she is able to continue. Maria is very happy with her and the show becomes very successful. Sulu also enjoys her work. But at times, Ashok expresses his frustration either at his job or hers. It seems that life is like a roller coaster ride for Sulu, high at work and low at home.
One day, she gets a call from her son's school and they visit his principal's office. The principal reveals that he is charging some other kids for showing some videos on the phone he stole from Ashok, as well as faking his signatures over the remarks written in his school dairy. On this basis, he suspends her son from the school. This becomes a very big issue in their family and Sulu's sisters blame her that because of her job she has neglected her son. They decide that she now has to leave the job and her son would not stay with them because her low level of education is causing similar influence on him. Sulu takes a tough stand, rejects both the conditions and leaves for her job. While coming back, she gets a call that her son is missing. They later find a note by him, revealing he is very ashamed of what he has done. He is very sad to see that his mother had to leave her job because of his actions. He requests his father to support his mother and her job.
Next day police find her son and bring him home. Sulu goes to her office and resigns. She feels that she is not able to handle the emotional turmoil at home. Just as she is leaving, she finds the receptionist having a fight with the tiffin service guy. Sulu has an idea and she requests Maria to give her the contract for the tiffin service. Next, we see Ashok managing the tiffin business and Sulu going to her job; managing both the household and her professional life in her own unique style."

He is wanted for killing approximately 184 people, about half of whom were police officers, including senior police and forest officials. He was also wanted for poaching about 200 elephants and smuggling ivory worth US$2,600,000 and about 10,000 tonnes of sandalwood worth approximately US$22,000,000.

Years later, Veerappan avenges the death of his close associate Gandhi by misleading Special Task Force (STF) personnel in their covert operation, through Gandhi's unnamed notorious informer (Aziz Naser).

U Turn,"Rachana (Shraddha Srinath), an intern, with The Indian Express, a daily newspaper, is working on an article on the incidents at a Bangalore flyover. She also has a crush on the crime reporter Aditya, whose help she seeks for research material on accidents on the flyover. She finds that each day some motorists move the concrete blocks that partition the road just to take a quick U-turn and avoid the traffic. They don’t move them back and the blocks are left to lie randomly on the road leading to many accidents. A homeless man sitting on the flyover notes down the vehicle numbers of commuters who violate the rule to take the U-turn and gives the list to Rachana. She obtains the details of the culprits using her contact in the traffic department, with the intention of confronting them for their ""short-cut"" and writing an article for the paper. Her attempt to meet the first person on the list goes in vain. Later the same day, the police take her into custody and accuse her of killing the same person she wanted to meet. She is shocked and tells her side of the story. Though the senior police officer rejects it, sub-inspector Nayak, finds it believable and does some investigation. It is revealed that all the persons Rachana has on her list have committed suicide. They also noticed that they have committed suicide the same day they took the wrong ""u-turn"". Rachana and Nayak find another number has been noted by the homeless man which is to be delivered to Rachana the next day.

With no way of finding the real cause of the death of the culprits, Rachana herself takes the wrong u-turn and waits for something to happen. The one who has been killing the culprits is a woman named Maya, because she and her daughter Aarna died in an accident due to the concrete road blocks that were moved by the culprits in order to make way for their u-turn. Using her supernatural powers, Maya tries to kill Rachana as well. But Rachana promises to find the person who was responsible for Maya's death. Maya agrees. Rachana, with the help of Nayak, tries to find the person who moved the blocks on the day of Maya's accident. They find out the phone number and address of the guy who moved the block. Rachana writes this on a balloon and leaves it on the flyover for Maya to find. She then invites her boyfriend Aditya for dinner. During dinner she tries to call the number she found out earlier. It turns out to be Aditya's work mobile number. Devastated she confronts Aditya and informs him that due to his negligence a mother and daughter lost their lives. Aditya says it was not him who made the U turn. He merely exchanged his bike with his friend. In the final twist, it is revealed that the guy who moved the block was Maya's own husband. Maya's ghost is waiting in Aditya's house to kill him, when Maya's husband whom Rachna has informed about the events turns up and explains to Maya that it was because of him that they lost their lives. He then tries to commit suicide by jumping from the balcony. Maya's ghost saves him and tells him that his punishment is to suffer in this world without his wife and daughter."

Guppy,"Named after the angel, Michael, rather known as Guppy, is the sole support to his ailing mother. A talented artist, the teenager earns a living by rearing and selling the ornamental fish – Guppy. He takes great care of his disabled Mother. He wants nothing but the best for her, be it the happiness in her life or the fully automatic wheelchair that he aspires to gift her someday. Her son fills her only prayers to the Almighty, that he may be guarded in all his ways. The little mischiefs that his gang gets into and the occasional glimpses from the teenage beauty, Amina, make his day. Their small fishing village, lately, is under a lot of excitement. Their dream project just got sanctioned – a railway overbridge, to bypass the railway gate en route. With great zeal, the people await the engineers from Road and Bridges Development Corporation.
Meanwhile, somewhere in the Himalayas, a rider starts his journey leaving his dear ones and 'Malu', heading for the village. He arrives at the small roadside stall where the boy works, stopping for a tea. Like the others present, Guppy, gets prejudiced with the unconcerned lifestyle of a rider, for people here strive hard to subsist. Gaps in communication and probably his biased views, offend the individual with the tea hence given. The experience ends on a bad note for the two, with both their egos getting hurt. Little did Guppy know the rider was here to stay, for he is Er. Thejus Varkey in charge of building the bridge. A near miss accident the next day give Guppy his upper hand and the teen gang loot the engineer for damages, when there actually is none.
Days pass by and the rest of the team arrive. Works start with initial planning and sketching. The engineer befriends the local village officer and convince him to slash the price per pair, the office pays to the boy. Being forced an apology, Guppy’s self-esteem urge him otherwise. The engineer find the boy near the office jeep, with flat tires, waiting for him. Instincts send the boy running, while the engineer chases after him and slap him, driving the rest of the gang to attack in defence. With a stone, Guppy smash that hand of the engineer that slapped him. Later, the team find their tent vandalized, burnt to ashes, leading Thejus to send back his team till he finish the unresolved task.
Thejus takes his time off, studying the canals and former civil undertakings. The secretive plan takes shape. The illegal pisciculture of the boy in the blocked drainage, causing floods during rain, along with the roadside stall where he works, are to be destroyed by the police, as part of the expansion of roads for the bridge. Giving no time to shift, the tank is mercilessly wrecked sending the fish down the drain, all the way. The engineer’s revenge is complete and the harm is done. From his meager savings, Guppy hire an outlaw to hurt the man in return. Something then happens, the boy didn’t expect. The engineer is stabbed, from the front, horrifying the kid.
Guppy now know, things spiraled out of hand. The engineer’s silence to the police frightens him even more, for the revenge will be something worse. Left all alone, helplessly watching his dreams slipping away and awaiting his assured fate, his pride and courage all drain out. His fear does not go unnoticed by his mother, to whom he reveal nothing. Thejus on the other hand, lonely on the hospital bed, is in pain, but not physically. He too awaits to regain strength, to meet the boy.
Amina, the girl fancied by the gang, lives with her grandparents as her parents are both dead. The grandfather (whom she calls Uppooppa) works as the temporary gate operator at the railway gate, hoping to make her an engineer one day. Once the overbridge is commissioned, he will lose his job and at his age, is unable to find another. His mannerisms always irritated the team and he couldn’t make friends with any. The solution to the poor man’s problems, thought out by his slender perspective, was to drive the team away. He was the one who punctured the tires of the office jeep and destroyed their tent. When nothing seemed to work, at the end of his pitiful rope, face covered, he stabbed the engineer. But now the thoughts scare him. He is admitted in the hospital with chest pain and regrets his actions.
Thejus came to build the bridge and leave, intending no one no harm. Coming to know of the surrounding political scams, village officer’s illicit relationship, the peon’s corruption or even the guest house caretaker’s laziness; nothing bothered him. But, the wounded ego set him on a path chasing after a small child, probably not much older than his own, spending all his energy to drench the kid in pain. He realize that his very presence chocked the lives of two innocent souls and their dependents. The bridge, on the other hand, is just a political stunt targeting the vote bank; with nothing fruitful coming out of it for the society. Stating ‘technically unfeasible’, he stops the million-rupee project; delaying the construction for at least another ten years. He meets Uppooppa to say that he understands and he will help with Amina’s dreams; forgiving him for his insanity. Revealing the courage to correct his deeds, he rebuilds Guppy’s tank and gift it in grandiose; before leaving the place empty-handed. Guppy, relieved from his worries, run home to his mother with the happy news. Leaving him all alone, he finds her having breathed her last; another gift, the long-awaited wheelchair, still on its way.
It has now been days since the boy left. The old man, Tinku as he is fondly called, come back after weeks of caring for an old lady, who might have been his long-lost mother. He happened to have read about Thejus Varkey, who filled the news some years back. He was the engineer who constructed the much anticipated Omallur Bridge. On the day of the inauguration, his family met with an accident – killing his parents, wife and his 7-year-old daughter. Riding was his way out of his grief. To him, every child that he met was his daughter Malu; refusing to leave her with the dead. This railway bridge was likely the only work he undertook since.
Thejus is shown once again riding through the Himalayas with his dear 'Malu', never having been so relieved and content, with the happy child Michael in his care. Like an answer to the prayers of his mother, Michael will never be left alone and so will be Thejus."

Aanandam,"The story revolves around a group of seven friends who embark on their first IV tour (Industrial Visit) of their college life and how it affects small to large changes in their mellow lives. “Rockstar” Gautham, Kuppi (K. Unnikrishnan Pillai), Devika (aka Devooty), Diya, Darshana, Varun and Akshay, along with a group of 33 classmates and two faculty members (Chacko sir and Lovely miss) travel to Hampi via Mysuru and then to Goa for the New Year’s Eve. Varun organizes the trip as he's recommended by the whole class.
Gautham and Devika are the lovebirds of the group, with Gautham’s talent in western music being the spark kindling the relationship. While Gautham is no longer interested in western music and wish to pursue Hindustani classical music; he is forced to mask that part of his identity from Devika for the fear of how her reaction will be. Diya with her lovely nature had been the fascination of Akshay’s dreams for a long time, which is known to everyone, except her. The lively nature of Diya had attracted many others in the past (including Varun, known only to Kuppi), who obviously confess their feelings only to get turned down as she never adds a different colour to her friendships. Akshay, being apprehensive, never wishes to do the same and hopes that she likes him on her own terms. He never even talks to her and his friends recommend that he can never pray for a better chance than their first year IV. Akshay is also hunted by many fears including fear of water, fear of heights, among others; but the worst one being his fear of future, as he is often being compared with his successful elder brother, Akash, who set the standards too high. Varun had earlier confessed his feelings to Diya, who rejected the proposal hoping to remain friends. With a feeling of insult, he couldn’t do that anymore, leading him to his familiar trait of anger and distant nature. He even remains hostile to another classmate who has a crush on him. The girl, on various occasions tries to approach him, but each time he dispassionately avoids her. In spite of his cold attitude, he is respected among his friends and classmates alike for his discipline and efficiency. He is often too detached from the group carrying on with his responsibilities, that it comes to the notice of even their bus driver, Josettan. Diya, whose parents just got divorced joins the trip as an escape from her distress. She doesn’t reveal about the divorce to her dear friends – Devika and Darshana or any others for the fear of their sympathy, which can make the situation even more difficult on her. She easily manages to hide her secrets in her cheerful semblance. Kuppi’s only intention coming for the IV was to have a good time with his three best friends, which is often denied due to the occurrences around him. Darshana, a reserved person by nature, thinks the world of her friends, being a silent partner in all their activities and a curious observer to all the happenings around them. Her only outlet of emotions is her sketchbook that she holds dear and private.
During the trip, Diya succeeds in talking to Varun. She resolves their differences to slowly gain back her old friend. Akshay’s friends manage to seat Diya near him during the overnight journey to Goa, whereby Akshay finally gets a chance to privately talk to her. They converse through the night, where Diya grows fond of someone for the first time. With a little nudge from her friends, Diya starts to reciprocate Akshay’s feelings. Coming to know of Akshay’s irrational fears, Diya gets him to face his fears, starting with the adventure sport of bungee jumping. With his first fear conquered, he does the same with his next by finally confessing his feelings to Diya, which she welcomes.
Diya opens up about her parent’s divorce to Akshay, which he accidentally reveals to Gautham and through him to Devika, who openly consoles Diya revealing the secret to the whole group. At the same time, Kuppi in a state of intoxication reveals every other secrets about the group – Diya's relation with Akshay, Varun’s proposal and Gautham’s fear, to everyone else. Offended, Diya retreats to her room. Coming back to his senses, Kuppi realizes how bad his act was. On the next day (also the last day of the trip), Kuppi apologizes to his best friends revealing how tough it was for him to be denied their presence and they reconcile. Gautham reveals his interests to Devika, who gradually accepts and share in his likes. Meanwhile, Varun learns that their expensive tickets to the New Year’s party are fake. To his surprise, no one blames him and the group now has the huge task to search for another party.
Diya still stays away from the group, mainly because she can’t come to trips with her mother leaving her father. She doesn’t talk to anyone including Akshay, much to the dismay of the group. During the search for a party, Akshay runs into his “ideal” brother, Akash, partying in Goa. Although astonished at the find, they share a talk, whereby Akshay no longer fears for his future. With his brother’s help he finds an Origami themed party for the night (as Diya likes them). On Akshay’s initiative,his professor instigates a talk between Diya's father and Diya, over the phone. Her father reveals the facts behind the divorce and she gets told that the divorce is not that difficult on him, as she imagines it to be. With a feeling of relief despite being sad, she finally rejoins the group for the party. During the party, Darshana shows Diya her sketchbook, which reveals how Akshay and Diya filled her thoughts of late and how happy she was, when she was with him. Diya confesses her feelings to Akshay, rekindling their relationship. Also, Varun apologizes to Diya for his prolonged unfriendly behaviour. He then joins the group for the first time, to celebrate the New Year after Josettan tells him that you can never find time for happiness if you wait for your responsibilities to end, as time slips through your fingers before you even know it.
Back in college, the 'changed' Akshay and Diya are now a couple. Varun is more friendly and content. Kuppi pursues a photography initiative with his new girlfriend Cathy, whom he met whilst on the trip. Devika developed a liking for Hindustani music, like Gautham and he on the other hand, overcame his fear of needles to get a couple tattoo with Devika. Darshana is more open about her drawings to her intimate friends."

They finally get divorced after their differences leaving her son Ibrahim under Faizal's care. Shaheed, a colleague from work understands all her problems and wishes to marry her. Though Sameera is initially hesitant about another marriage, the two get married before moving to Iraq. ‌They along with a group of 19 nurses of same hospital moves to Iraq to join Tikrit Teaching College, which was an Iraqi Government Hospital.
Moving to Iraq, they realize Iraq is no more a peaceful country as projected during interview time, with conflicts rising on daily basis. The doctors are over-strained with rise of casualties. Sameera's knowledge in Arabic helps her to communicate better with Arabic doctors and she leads the nurses group in their new working environment and challenges. In mean time, she got pregnant and need to hide this from her first son, Ibrahim who is due to come for his vacation with Sameera. Surprisingly for this vacation, Faizal also came along with son as part of permanently handing over Ibrahim to Sameera due to issues in his family. Ibrahim finds hard to accept Shaheed as his new step father and when he realizes that his mom got remarried, he runs out of their quarters only to see the city is now a major riot zone with pro-ISIS supporters uprising against Iraqi Central Government in the city. He was brought back to quarters by Sameera. Shaheed feels that Ibrahim needs some time alone with Sameera to realize the new environment. For this, he offers his assistance to Army medical team moving to Mosul to deal the local casualties over there. He consoles Sameera that its a matter of two weeks which is sufficient for Ibrahim to get adjusted to his new realities and the mission is not dangerous as army is along with them.
However within a day, Mosul fell into hands of ISIS and the medical team is taken into captive. News gets flashed and Sameera pleads with hospital management to help in rescuing her husband. As Iraqi forces retreats from Mosul, the Iraqi government is no longer in position to help. The Hospital manager advises Sameera to seek assistance of Indian Embassy in Baghdad. Sameera along with manager visits Embassy where she meets Indian Ambassador Manoj Abraham. They promise assistance though reminded that its a war zone and Indian Government has its own limitations in intervening.
While Sameera was in Baghdad, Tikrit fell into ISIS hands which they discover while coming back to hospital. ISIS militants kills the manager, while bring Sameera back to hospital to join with other nurses who are now captives of ISIS. Sameera relays this matter to Indian Embassy and calls out for help, which brings the matter to serious concern of both Indian Government and Kerala Government, as all nurses were from Kerala state.
In meantime at Mosul, ISIS terrorists kills the doctor for not complying with them to treat wounded terrorists. Shaheed to save his life, offers medical assistance to wounded ISIS terrorists. Sameera started keeping informed about the tensed situation at Tikrit thro' her mobile to Kerala government. The Chief Minister of Kerala along with India's Foreign Affairs Minister started briefing with Ambassador. As there is no direct communication or normal diplomatic relationships exist with ISIS, India government has little chances of a formal route to intervene. India Government sends its Foreign Secretary to Iraq, who initially thinks that Iraqi Army will help the stranded nurses out of Tikrit. However Ambassador doesn't join on that and assumes full responsibility to rescue. Meanwhile International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement offers their assistance and a bus was arranged to fetch all stranded nurses out of Tikrit. However as they need to pass through extreme violent war zones of Mosul, Indian Embassy cancels permission, which results only Indian Nurses stranding in Tikrit, while other nationalities taken out. However the decision of Indian Embassy proved right when the bus get caught in a crossfire near Mosul, killing all nurses. With just Indian 19 nurses stranded in Tikrit, ISIS decides to use them as human shields and plan to take them to their key base Mosul. India responds by dropping food packets near hospital, but one packet contains a secret satellite phone with location detector which Sameera take over to correspond with Crisis Command center at Indian Embassy.
Ambassador Manoj instructs Sameera to destroy all passports and documents that reveal their identity and asked to all of the nurses to declare themselves as Muslims as ISIS terrorists might kill non Muslims among them. Sameera teaches all other nurses basic religious things like Namaz and covering the head as well as hiding all religious symbols. Meantime, Kerala Government along with its Foreign affairs agency- NORKA brings in a prominent Malayalee Businessman- Jayamohan of Crescent Group who have close links with Saudi Royal Family to persuade the Royal Family to broker with ISIS on India's behalf. Jayamohan, after hearing the nurses pleas over their satellite phone, rushes to Riyadh's Erga Palace to meet then-the Crown prince Salman of Saudi, requesting his assistance to intervene as Saudis being a major financial handler to ISIS at the time. Initially Saudi Prince refuses. After a prolonged discussion, Saudi agrees to broker on behalf of India unofficially without any record.
Meanwhile at Mosul ISIS base, Sameera and nurses were brought before a main cleric, who tests them to ensure they all are Muslims. Sameera's knowledge in Arabic, her son's knowledge in Quran and the coordinated Namaaz all helped them to believe that the entire nurses are of Muslims and no harm was done. With Saudi's intervention, a secret deal was drawn between India and ISIS. ISIS agrees to transfer the nurses to Erbil near the Kurdistan Check Point. Meanwhile with Sameera's persistence, she finds out Shaheed among ISIS captives who were about to be executed and with her pleas, she was able to rescue him from there. Sameera, Shaheed, Ibrahim and nurses were brought to Kurdistan from where India took over them in their buses and a special flight was arranged to take back to Cochin from Erbil.

Georgettan's Pooram,"P. V. Mathayyi was a participant in the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. After India beat Bangladesh, P.V Mathayyi rose to prominence as one of the first Malayalis, from the district of Thrissur to win a gold medal at the Asian Games. When the Games ended, Mathayyi was welcomed back wholeheartedly by the rest of the people in his area. He gifted the youth of the place a ground and a sports club, which the people named Mathayyiparambu. However, the happiness was short-lived, after Mathayyi was killed in a road accident. The people built a statue in his honour in Mathayyiparambu, but soon afterwards, the people forgot the ground's initial use as a sports ground, and the place became a place for the youth to loiter around and play football.
Vava, Thankan and Pallan are three boys who loiter around on Mathayyiparambu. Their parents are annoyed and Vava's father (Sunil Sukhada) tells Fr. Mathews Vadakkan (Renji Panicker), a local Mar Thoma priest to set them on the right path and he grants his son George this responsibility. After class one day, the three boys find George peeping through the bathroom, and catch him doing this. After this incident, they say that George is their leader and is one of them.
Years later, George (Dileep), Vava (Vinay Forrt), Pallan (Sharaf U Dheen) and Thankan (Thiru Aftab) are still loitering around the ground doing nothing. They have a small gathering on top of a small tower in Mathayyiparambu, where Joseph (T.G Ravi), a local beggar who takes only Rs. 10 from the poor box near Jesus' statue and from George, welcomes them like his own children. Fr. Vadakkan is disappointed in his son George and wants him to become a bishop. George tries to impress his father by doing various things in the community, but each activity ends in disaster.
Later, two people come and ask for the gang's permission of starting a driving school in Mathayyiparambu. Although at first reluctant, they agree immediately when the two explain that it is a ladies' driving school. However, they are disappointed when they see old women in the school. Then they hear the sad news of the death of a local MLA and a funeral is held by his son Simon (Sudheer Karamana). There, George meets Merlin (Rajisha Vijayan), a singer, and instantly falls in love. He is disappointed at the fact that he doesn't know anything about her, not even her name (he didn't find this out). Him and his friends decide to go to their house the next day to find out anything about her, but this ends in disaster.
The next day, Vava explains that he has a proposal. George and his friends decide to go with him, but he drops off his brother Jose (Jeevan Gopal) at the local convent school, as their father now wants Jose to become a bishop, much to George's delight. There George plays a game of carroms against Kichu (Ganapathi), places a bet of Rs. 2000 but loses the bet. After, he goes with Vava to the marriage proposal and George takes Rs. 2000 from the girl's dad and gives it to Kichu, angering the dad. He cancels the proposal between the two.
George goes and decides to stop the driving school at Mathayyiparambu, as he is disappointed at the fact that there are only old women coming. Right afterwards Merlin comes, and George decides to let the driving school carry on. The driving school teacher tells George that she is going to become a nun which her mother insisted, as she said that she doesn't have the three qualities a girl needs to have: desire, wish and love. George finds her desiring for and eating a nellikka, and tells her that he has proven she has one of the three qualities. George, after joining a class at the convent school, is saved by Merlin after a priest asks him questions. George understands this and tells her that he has proven the second of the three qualities, as she saved him in front of the priest.
As they leave the convent school, the gang meet a bunch of youths smoking weed outside. George gets angry over this and starts a fight. As George beats up the last person, his father Fr. Vadakkan slaps him, as Fr. Vadakkan is disappointed even more in him. He goes to Mathayyiparambu, but unexpectadly, his mother Mercykutty (Kalaranjini) comes to visit him. She suggests to George that he should never enter the house.
The next day, the locals gather to find some construction on Mathayyiparambu. George and his gang go and find Peter Mathayyi (Chemban Vinod Jose), who explains that he is the son of P.V Mathayyi and that Mathayiparambu is his. They go to Fr. Vadakkan's church and fight the case out there with the priest, where Peter seems to be favored. In retaliation, George and his gang decide to set up a stray dog conservation scheme on Mathayyiparambu, which ends in disaster, ruining George's name in the land. Peter then meets George and attempts to gain George's trust by saying that he is ready to give Mathayyiparambu away and leave it to waste. George is saddened and says that he is ready to accept any of Peter's demands. Peter suggests that they start a kabaddi team, which George accepts."

Now Kichu is eager to know this so-called comrade and asks Prabhakaran(an acquaintance of comrade) about him.
Prabhakaran starts to tell the story of comrade Krishnan. Krishnan was a party member who was sent to Peerumedu by party's Kottayam district committee to develop their party's influence there. Krishnan raised voice against the poor wage giving to workers at tea estate but the manager of the estate was not interested in raising the wage. Krishnan led a strike with all the workers and the tea factory was forced to raise the wage. Krishnan's next move was against a Brahmin land lord. The land lord was giving labour to Tamil people for poor wage instead of malayalees. Krishnan and his party talked to the land lord but he didn't negotiate. And the land lord didn't do the cultivation that year. Krishnan and workers started cultivating in the land lord's land and produced a good yield. They were ready to give the yield to the land lord at a condition that he should give them the proper wage. He was forced to accept.
Krishnan gave word to comrade Janaki's family that he would marry her. They got married after some events. After some years Krishnan had a stroke and got into partial paralysis. Then he came to know that the old factory where they did their first strike was closed down and workers are in poverty. Krishnan visited a rich man who had got many helps from him and asked him if he can buy that estate and start the factory. He accepted it at a request that Krishnan should be one among in the governal body of the factory. Krishnan accepted this and later came to know that a young man Tony had captured some of the land in the estate. Krishnan ordered him to get his resort closed. Tony stabbed Krishnan after somedays at a night to retain his resort and that's the story of Krishnan.
Kichu now comes to know that the way he is living is not the way a comrade should live. Krishnan's surgery was successful and all of them in the hospital was happy. Kichu hesitated to see Krishnan's face as he had cherished his personality in his heart. Kichu goes to peerumedu with his youth wing comrades and beatsup Tony who stabbed Krishnan and he proclaims that Krishnan's legend will be continued through them."

Baahubali: The Conclusion (Dubbed version),"Kattappa continues to narrate how he ended up killing Amarendra Baahubali.
After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra Baahubali is declared as the future king of Mahishmati and Bhallaladeva its commander-in-chief. The Rajamata Sivagami orders Amarendra to tour the kingdom and its neighbourhood, along with Kattappa. During the tour, Amarendra witnesses an attack by Devasena, the princess of Kuntala, a kingdom neighbouring Mahishmati. Falling in love with her, he approaches her after the fight, posing as a simpleton, and is accepted into the royal palace for a job.
Bhallaladeva receives message of Amarendra's act and upon viewing Devasena's portrait, lusts for her. He asks Sivagami for Devasena's hand in marriage. The Rajamata, who was unaware of Amarendra's feelings for Devasena, assures Bhallaladeva and sends an emissary to Kuntala, who delivers the marriage proposal in a patronising way. An insulted Devasena rejects the proposal with a scathing reply. Enraged hearing her response, Sivagami sends an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive.
Meanwhile, Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a dacoit-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Devasena's maternal cousin, Kumara Varma, is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Upon being questioned, Amarendra reveals his true identity. He receives a bird post from Mahishmati, ordering him to take Devasena as captive. He promises Devasena that he will protect her honour and convinces her to come with him to Mahishmati as his future bride.
Upon reaching Mahishmati, the misunderstanding is brought to light and when an ultimatum is delivered to Amarendra that he must either choose the throne or Devasena, he chooses the latter. Bhallaladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the new commander-in-chief. During Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva rids Amarendra of his duties as a ""gift"".

Kumara Varma enters the palace in the stealth of the night, only to be discovered by Bhallaladeva and be killed, but not before revealing their plot to convince Sivagami to kill Amarendra. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's life is under threat but that open hostility would result in civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, and then stabs him in the back and kills him.
After Amarendra's death, Kattappa soon learns of Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami, who reveals to the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and that the baby Mahendra Baahubali has ascended the throne. As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with the new King but falls into a river after being hit by an arrow shot by Bhallaladeva. As Bhallaladeva holds Devasena prisoner for the next 25 years and destroys Kuntala, Mahendra grows up and leads the rebel group that has indulged in guerrilla warfare against King Bhallaladeva.
After listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali (alias Sivudu) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati along with Avantika and the people of the city. After an ensuing battle, Bhallaladeva is defeated by Mahendra and burnt alive on a pyre prepared by Devasena.

Prof. Premraj, also called Kamaraj (Salim Kumar), is the vice-principal of a college who tries to stop relationships between male and female students while continuing a relationship with a cleaner, and watches pornographic videos. Two student gangs; the 'kadappuram' (seafront) gang led by Franklin (Appani Sarath) and the 'Thiruvananthapuram' (city) gang led by Sameer (Arun Kurian). During one of these fights, the gangs break a picture of Vishwan. Premraj installs CCTV cameras in the campus. Franklin's friend Vignyanaakoshi (Jude Anthany Joseph) interferes with the system to show pornographic videos; Premraj turns on the monitor, sees the videos and is caught by Fr. George Kaattuparambu (Shivaji Guruvayoor), who suspends him from his job. Premraj tells Sameer and his gang he is innocent of the offence but is being replaced as vice-principal and is powerless to act. He orders the gang to break the new vice-principle's legs; Sameer agrees to this and the gang hold a small protest by the gate as Vishwan's replacement arrives. Franklin also arrives and congratulates the new vice-principal.
The new vice-principal is Michael Idicula (Mohanlal), who avoids Sameer's plan to break his legs. He introduces himself to the teachers, including Mary (Anna Rajan). Michael's first class of students—especially Sameer, who was praised for making a short film—seem to like him. This disappoints Franklin, who was expecting Michael to befriend Franklin instead. One day, Michael meets Franklin's father Varkey (Prasad Mohammah), who is drunk and invites Michael to his house. He meets Franklin's family. Later, the physics teacher Anumol (Sneha Sreekumar), who is Mary's friend, decides to propose to Michael on her behalf. When they go to meet Michael, he tells them to meet after the morning Mass at the local Latin church. They discover Michael is a priest and wonder why he still did not marry. Anumol and Mary cancel their planned proposal; instead Anumol asks Michael if he knows anyone willing to marry Mary, to which Michael agrees. Meanwhile, Michael reconciles Sameer and Franklin and their gangs, and they also meet Vareethettan (Alencier Ley Lopez), who has been serving Micheal's family for a long time.
Michael, as vice-principal, is popular with the students and the staff. When Michael suggests making a feature film to raise money for building two hostels for the college, Fr. Kaattuparambu gives permission, providing only the Phoenix College staff and students are in the film. Michael calls his friend, Malayalam film producer Vijay Babu, about the project, and he agrees to take part. According to Vijay, the story is only suitable for a short film and Michael suggests the story of Vishwan,who had campaigned for a college to be built on land originally owned by Maathan Tharakan. He describes Vishwan as a violent but honest man who always did the right thing whenever he could. Maathan Tharakan killed Vishwan the day after the college's cornerstone was laid, and paid to have his right-hand man Kaaka Rameshan sent to jail. Vijay says the story is perfect and goes ahead with the project.
Auditions for the film's characters are held and all of the roles except that of Vishwan—whom no-one portrays well—are cast. Because of this, Vijay decides to freeze the project. They eventually find someone who is perfect for the role—Michael—who changes his appearance completely. The film's production begins.
Principal photography of the film begins; all of the actors—except Premraj (portraying Maathan Tharakan), who has difficulties in acting—perform well. Meanwhile, Michael meets Vishwan's widow Jayanthi (Priyanka Nair) and her second daughter Sreekutty, who explain that their first daughter died. One night, Premraj is beaten up by the real Maathan Tharakan and his gang, who warn him Michael will suffer the same fate if he carries on with the film. Michael goes to meet Maathan and tells him filming must continue. One night, Maathan tells Michael the story about Vishwan's death is wrong and that Kaaka Rameshan was the true killer; Vishwan was killed because he married Rameshan's lover Jayanthi. Shocked, Michael asks Sameer & Franklin to restructure the climax; after much argument, both agrees to the demands.
The crew film the death of Vishwan's first child. After the filming, Michael signs a form in the name of Vishwan, shocking Vareethettan. He tells the staff and students Michael's father resented his son becoming a priest and forcibly removed him from the seminary; this incident affected Michael as a psychological illness. Vareethettan says Michael adopts the personality of characters he really likes, and asks them to stop Michael from acting. Michael vanishes but he—still speaking as Vishwan—threatens Varkey into revealing how Vishwan's first daughter died; Varkey says Kaaka Rameshan drowned her in a pond. Varkey told the real Vishwan everything and Vishwan started fighting Rameshan and got himself killed. The next day, Rameshan is released from jail and tells some of the people there he killed Vishwan, shocking everyone. Rameshan creates a fuss at the filming and then arrives at the climax scene. There, Michael—who is supposed to be receiving a whack on the head from another actor—stops and beats up the actor. Rameshan gets involved and tells the crew he killed Vishwan, angering Michael, who nearly kills Rameshan.
Vishwan's death is not depicted in the students' film; instead a caption tells the audience; ""Vishwan lives in the minds of everyone"". Michael's illness has been cured and the bishop explains that Michael is the best person to inaugurate the new hostel. He does this and announces that he will become the new principal of the Phoenix College. The film ends as all of them stands together to take a selfie."

Appa's wife Kaveri is very devoted to him and she does not question his decision. They move to their son-in-law and daughter Vidya's place. Appa continues with his carefree and frank ways, at times laden with few expletives. Their son-in-law, Rahul Barve (Sunil Barve) is a high ranking engineer in his company and is of a caring nature. Vidya (Mrunmayee Deshpande) also confronts similar embarrassing situations as Neha, but her husband Rahul does not seem to mind it. He appreciates Appa's poetry (To be or not to be, that is the question) and his fluent style of recitals. On Vidya's anniversary Appa comes in an inebriated state and embarrasses Rahul's boss. Although next day Appa apologizes, Rahul does not seem to mind it and discards as one off incident.
Meanwhile, Appa remembers about his friend Rambhau and pays a visit to him. Rambhau is devastated after the demise of his wife Kumud. He lashes out at Appa for leaving him alone in his final days. The scene that follows is a heart touching conversation between Karna and Krishna enacted by Rambhau and Appa respectively while Rambhau is lying on his hospital bed. Mesmerized by Rambhau's performance and pitying his condition, Appa grants Rambhau his last wish.
The next day Appa returns to his son in law's house. Kaveri tells Appa that Rambhau had overdosed on sleeping pills and that he is no more to which Appa confesses that he gave the pills to him implying that, it was his last wish.
On another occasion Appa insults Rahul's boss's son when he could not stand his weak adaption of Othello. This irritates Vidya and she confronts her father. She makes their arrangement in her outhouse; however her husband still stands by Appa and regards this as a non-issue. Vidya makes sure that the outhouse is well maintained and they are taken good care.
One fine day Vidya misplaces money given to her by her husband and in a turn of events, she blames her parents for stealing it. This creates a rift between them. Vidya realizes her mistake later when she finds the money. She apologizes to her parents but it is too late as Appa and Kaveri have already decided to move out. Vidya's husband Rahul is still sympathetic with her parents but cannot change their hearts. In that night, they escape from the outhouse for their ancestral village where they have an old house in a dilapidated state. On the way they halt at a village, where Kaveri dies of fever. Appa is destroyed by this loss. He is supported by a boot polishwala named Raja. Raja is extremely poor and a homeless person who lives with his family under a bridge. Appa is at times in delusional state and suffers from the fact that the grandeur with which he had lived through as an actor is now making his pain unbearable in his state of loneliness and poverty. Appa serves tea at a tea stall where he enthralls his customers with his poetry recitals and dialogue from his plays. A man named Siddharth, who has a respect and great fondness for acting, continuously follows Appa, since, for Siddharth, he is a noble actor and an idol. Appa hides his real identity from Siddharth and refuses to acknowledge that he is 'Natsamrat'. Siddarth, however continues with his conviction regarding Appa being the great actor.
One day, Appa reads in the papers that his favorite theatre had burnt down in a fire. He goes there immediately and is completely shattered to see the theatre reduced to ashes. Siddharth also arrives there as he was following Appa. Here Appa starts reliving his old memories and also accepts Siddharth's clain that he is the real Natsamrat Ganpatrao when Siddharth reveals that he knew all about him and his past. His family and Raja also come there to find him. They request him to come home with him and to live with them but he refuses. The film ends magnificently albeit it has a tragic end. Appa is in a delusional state and shuffles between reality and the great personalities he had once portrayed as an actor on the very same stage. He gives his last performance on the theatre stage for Siddharth and says that, ""Do you understand, dear Siddarth, this is what theatre acting is all about? To fulfill one's longing"" He unexpectedly screams by placing a hand on his throat and collapses. Immediately everyone runs to hold him, but they find that he has already departed.[7]"

Baghtos Kay Mujra Kar,"Settled at the foothills of a fort is a quaint village 'Kharbujewaadi'. This village is a land of many a 'Mavla' who served Shivaji Maharaj with great valour. The courage, grit and sacrifice that this village had to offer, played a major role in King Shivaji's fight for 'Hindavi Swarajya'.
But... those were the days. Today, Kharbujewadi is a much developed modern town. Their eternal loyalty to the great Maratha king Shivaji, forever on exhibit, the village is strewn with shops named: Shivaji Vada Pav Centre, Jijamata Saree Corner, Sambhaji Pan Shop, Tanaji Medicals etc. Unfortunately, their love for their beloved king is limited to the signboards, slogans on the cars and saffron coloured tilak on the foreheads.
The most important symbol of the Hindavi Swarajya, the forts of Shivaji Maharaj are long forgotten. The once majestic fort overlooking this buzzing town lays in ruins, tainted with tobacco laden spit, garbage, empty beer bottles and lovers declaring their love for each other on the same walls where the brave mawlas spilt their blood for Swarajya.

What is this outrageous plan? Is it going to work? Will their dream to restore this fort become a reality?"

After talking to each other, they hear another prisoner, Jarnail Singh, arguing with Aman, a girl who was his bride-to-be before being arrested.
After arguing with Aman, Tarsem Lal goes to comfort Jarnail, and asks about the argument. Jarnail tells his story. Before being arrested, Jarnail was a dairy farmer who sold milk in the village. He goes to meet Aman's family, and wants to marry her. Aman, talking to Jarnail privately, says that she wants a love marriage, while Aman's brother wants her to marry his friend, in exchange for drugs. Jarnail decides to refuse the marriage proposal on Aman's behalf, and tells his friend,Baljit.
Sometime later, Jarnail finds that Aman teaches English to the elderly. Jarnail decides to join Aman's class, and Aman eventually falls in love with him. Jarnail goes back to Aman's family, and re-establish the marriage proposal, but Aman's brother seems unhappy.
On the way back home from Aman's house, he is stopped and checked by a Police officer, who finds opium in one of his milk cans. Although Jarnail claims innocence, he is still arrested, and Aman's family breaks ties with him. Jarnail believes that Aman's brother is responsible for his arrest, but Aman doesn't believe him. Aman came to the jail today to tell him that her marriage is fixed, and she will be married tomorrow, on Vaisakhi. Tarsem then tells Jarnail that they can escape the jail, but Jarnail, who knows that Tarsem has tried escaping multiple times, doesn't believe him.
Later, Tarsem tells his story. Prior to his arrest, Tarsem sold toys on his bike, and his only joy was his son. While he wanted his son to go to school, he wasn't worried about his son's grades, only that his son was happy. One day, while walking his son back from school, a police officer almost runs over Tarsem's son on his scooter. Tarsem, angry at the officer, slaps him. He is arrested for attacking an officer. While his original time in prison was supposed to be for a few months, his multiple attempts at escaping(including pole-vaulting over the walls, have failed, and have caused him to increase his jail time. Tarsem tells Jarnail that his only reason for escaping is so he can see his son again. Jarnail asks Tarsem how he plans to escape. Tarsem explains that he dug a tunnel in the jail's garden, and that he has a copy of each cell block's keys.
That night, Jarnail and Tarsem escape through the tunnel, and steal two guys' shirts and car. Jarnail drops Tarsem off at his house, and Jarnail goes to Aman's house. Aman and Jarnail elope. Tarsem goes to see his grandparents, but they are all unhappy to see him, as he tells that he escaped, when he had only one month left. Tarsem then sees son, but when his son unwilling to come with him, Tarsem is hurt. He then stays outside the house, hoping his son will forgive him.
The next morning, Jalaur is preparing the jail for a Vaisakhi Celebration, and the Jail Minister is coming. He also asks for the constables to bring Jarnail and Tarsem to his office, but they are nowhere to be found.
Jarnail and Aman make a stop, where Jarnail wants to call Jalaur, as he doesn't want Jalaur's job to suffer for his and Tarsem's escape. Jalaur answers, in a good mood, although surprised that Jarnail is calling him. Jalaur tells Jarnail that he has a surprise for him: On Vaisakhi day, those who were arrested for minor crimes are to be released, which includes Jarnail and Tarsem. Jarnail tells Jalaur that they escaped through a tunnel last night. Jalaur then tells Jarnail to find Tarsem and get back to the jail via the tunnel as soon as possible, or they will all be in trouble. Jalaur then tells the constables to keep Jarnail and Tarsem's escape a secret, and find Tarsem's tunnel. They do, but fill it with sand before telling Jalaur, who is now more upset.
Jarnail and Aman go back and find Tarsem, and show him today's newspaper. He shows it to his son, where it shows that Tarsem and Jarnail are to be officially released. Tarsem then leaves, saying he'll be back once his name is cleared.
Tarsem and Jarnail first stop at Baljit house. At first, Jarnail talks to Baljit, as he wants Baljit to hide Aman from her family until his name is cleared. However, Aman calls Jarnail back when Baljit is not looking, as Aman is engaged to Baljit. The three then head back to the prison, while avoiding Aman's brother.
Meanwhile, Tarsem's brother-in-law, Bheem, sees in the newspaper about Tarsem's release, and goes to the prison to greet him. However, after finding out that Tarsem escaped, Jalaur has Bheem take one of his constables to Tarsem's favorite places, so that they can find Tarsem.
As Tarsem and Jarnail are driving back to the prison, they are chased by a police officer, along with the people that they stole the car from. Fortunately, Bheem and the constable are nearby and stall the constable.
Meanwhile, Jalaur must stall a pair of news-reporters(one who is the niece of the Jail Minister), who want to interview Tarsem and Jarnail. After trying to get them to eat sweets and snacks, as well as give them a tour of the place, Jalaur decides to scare them by giving them two other prisoners to interview, who are also named Tarsem and Jarnail, but have only been recently been put in prison for 1st-degree murder.
As Tarsem and Jarnail are getting close, they are soon stopped by Baljit, Baljit's father, and some thughs. He tells him that he is here for Aman, as they are getting married today, and reveals that he wanted to marry Aman before. After Jarnail's first marriage proposal broke, Baljit sent his own proposal, which broke after Aman agreed to marrying Jarnail. Baljit angry, decided to hide drugs in Jarnail's milk cans, and told the police officer to check the cans when Jarnail came by. Baljit won't allow Jarnail to pass unless he leaves Aman. Jarnail, with help from Tarsem then fights Baljit and his thugs. After knocking them out, they continue on their way.
At the prison, the Jail Minister, MLA Satpal Mander, and his assistant has arrived, making Jalaur even more nervous. Jalaur and the constables then try and stall the Minister, hoping Tarsem and Jarnail hurry and arrive.
Once outside the prison walls, Tarsem goes to the tunnel entrance, only to find that it's been filled with sand. Knowing it would take too long to dig out the sand, the two then try multiple ways to get over the walls, all which fail. As Jarnail suggests pole-vaulting over, Tarsem starts giving up hope. Jarnail convinces him that he will do it, that he must do it, for his son's sake.
At the same time, The Jail Minister is making a speech, and then asks Jalaur to come up and say a few words before bringing out Tarsem and Jarnail. Jalaur, feeling hopeless, decides to come clean. However, before he can admit the pair's escape, Tarsem and Jarnail jump and land in front of everyone.
Tarsem and Jarnail's release is officially signed. As the Jail Minister is leaving, his assistant says that it seemed like they broke in by the way they appeared. However, the Jail Minister ignores this. Tarsem meets with his family, and he and his son reconcile. Jarnail meets with Aman's family, having learned of Baljit's trickery and once again fix the alliance between Jarnail and Aman."

It starts with a man getting off a train and walking down the streets. Later that day, he has been followed by some men who then kill him and burn his body to erase evidences. Police find the body and try to investigate it. Then, the setting is moved to Ranjeet's house. Ranjeet lives with his parents and they are about to go to pick up his uncle. His uncle has been in jail for he feels he owes his life to his brother (Ranjeet's father) who saved his lifelong time ago. The plot is set back to the time when Ranjeet's father argues with someone from the village then his brother tries to settle it. Upset by his meddling, the villager takes out his gun and points it at him. Ranjeet's father saves him by knocking him down with a spade. However, he does it too hard that the man dies. Panicked by the situation, his brother tells him not to reveal the truth to anyone, instead he will take the blame. The police puts him in jail. Released from the jail, the uncle lives at his house.
Gurtej also lives with his family. He has one sister, Deepi (Shveta Grover), and falls in love with his neighbor, a mute girl (Sonia Kaur). Aside from studying, sometimes he sings chorus to back up singers to earn some money. He and Ranjeet are college and best friends. Ranjeet likes a girl from the college (Tanvi Nagi). Sometimes they hang out with their college friends. When night comes that day, Ranjeet makes his parents and uncle worried by turning home late. His father is furious about it but his mother tries to console him. Gurtej gets home finding his father and sister look sad. They just lost their tractor due to the loan they cannot yet pay. Gurtej consoles his father to put down his worries because soon he will find a job and buy him a new tractor.
The next morning, Ranjeet eats his breakfast before he goes to school. His father tries to settle their argument the previous night by telling him that if he needs anything, just simply ask. He is surprised by his father's changed behavior and thanks his mother for that. His uncle is amazed by how caring his mother is to his father. His mother tells him that it is a wife's commitment to serve her husband as her expression of love to him.
Finally, the day comes when Ranjeet and Gurtej pass the test and graduate. They try to find a job but it fails because the vacancy is no longer available for them who have no connections or money. Gurtej defends themselves by saying they have talents. Nevertheless, they are still turned down. At night, he is preoccupied with the thoughts that his father notices it and it saddens him. The morning after, he tells Ranjeet how his hope of making his parents happy and getting his sister married vanishes just like that. Suddenly, Deepi comes in a hurry sadly tells him something happens with their father. Rushing back to their village, they find that their father has passed away.
Surrendering their fate into God's hands, Ranjeet and Gurtej decide to pray in Harmandir Shahib. They ask God to lead them into His path. On their way out, they bump into an elderly man who accidentally slips on his way down the stairs. Ranjeet helps him by holding his arm. He notices that the man may be carrying some kind of talisman. Troubled by the thought, he tells Gurtej about it. Gurtej advises him to stop thinking about it. He tries to let it go but he sees the man again from afar. Lead by his conviction that the man is not a ""pure"" Sikh, he asks Gurtej to come with him to a police office. He tries to explain it to the chief but the chief refuses to proceed it for an investigation. He tells them to get out of the room. They go home feeling disappointed.
The next day, when Ranjeet walks alone, he bumps into a man and the man drops a paper. When the man looks at Ranjeet, he recognizes him as the one he saw at Harmandir Shahib. He directly picks up his stuff and walks away from Ranjeet. Realizing the paper is not his, Ranjeet follows the man to return the paper but he has gone. He carries it home. The man then follows Ranjeet home. At night, two men try to burgle Ranjeet's house to steal the paper but they get nothing for Ranjeet catches them before they succeed.
The next morning, he meets Gurtej to discuss about the paper. They both are convinced there is something fishy behind the blank paper. Mysterious phone calls are addressed to Ranjeet to hand in the paper. They decide to meet the person on the other line. Unfortunately, his identity remains hidden. Instead, he sends a woman to pick up the paper. Ranjeet follows her to get some information about who sends her. She persistently keeps it and accidentally dies falling from a rooftop when defending herself. A motorcycle gets near her dead body and the rider directly takes the paper from her hand.
Shocked by what happens, Ranjeet and Gurtej try to chase the rider. When confronted with him, they try to take back the paper and unmask him, but in the end he runs away. The man calls again and threatens Ranjeet that he makes a mistake and the consequence will be severe. He insists him handing back the paper to a man he will send. At the spot, Ranjeet meets the man while Gurtej is hanging a holed paint can on the car tailpipe so that it will leave mark on the streets for them to easy to track to where the car stops. They follow the car and it stops in front of an abandoned building. The curiosity leads them to discover that as soon as the paper is dipped in silver nitrate, it reveals a plan of terrorist bombing in Harmandir Shahib. They directly go out to call the police. However, by the time they come back, the men (the bombers) and all the evidence are already gone. Unconvinced by their report, the police leave the building, and again, they are disappointed. They decide they will solve the case by themselves.
By the day of the bombing plan, they go to Harmandir Shahib and try to trace all signs that can lead them to find the hidden bombs. This is not easy as Harmandir Shahib is full of devotees and they do not want to draw any attention. Finally, with all the struggle, they can find all the bombs. They are confronted by the bombers but in the end they win and kill them all. As they try to bring the bombs to safest places, the police arrive at the scene and mistakenly suspect them as the bombers. They are shot to dead. The news directly spreads across the city and it affects their whole families and friends with shock and tears.
When shown the dead bodies of the bombers, Gurtej, and Ranjeet at the coroner, the police chief recognizes Ranjeet and Gurtej.

Chauthi Koot,"The film plot synthesises two different stories set in a post-Operation Blue Star Punjab in the '80s. Fear and paranoia pervade the atmosphere as the general public is caught between excesses of both Khalistani militants and the Indian government forces fighting them. The first story is about a militant diktat[definition needed] in Punjab that prohibited family-owned dogs from barking, and the other is about two Hindu friends travelling to Amritsar in a nearly empty train. The film merges the two plots into one by making one of the friends travelling in the train recount the first story.[5]
The film opens with two Hindus friends Jugal and Raj looking for a train to Amritsar late in the evening. Having missed the last passenger train, they, along with a Sikh man in the same position, force their way onto a freight train. The small compartment already has a security man and two other young Sikhs besides a couple of train employees. The fearful atmosphere makes Jugal recount to Raj an earlier incident involving him, his wife and their young daughter.
The film goes into flashback. Lost at night in the countryside, Jugal, his wife and daughter reach a farmhouse in the outskirts of the village. While they are frightened to knock at the isolated house, they are not left with much choice. The family in the house, also suspicious at first, later lets them in, as the head of the house Joginder shows them the direction to take.
Later at night, Joginder and his family are visited by the Sikh militants who demand Joginder that he kill the family dog for drawing attention with its incessant barking. The family woes continue the next morning when the paramilitary men arrive looking for the separatists. They turn the house upside down before leaving.
The narrative moves back to the train on its way as the guard asks his unwanted passengers to leave before anyone notices them.[6][7]"

Now begins the game of one-upmanship among Jassi, Babbal and Karamjit. Jassi or Babbal, whom does Rubina choose forms the rest of the story. The first half sets up the traditional form of romance with Jassi head over heels in love with Rubina but failing to express his feelings. This half is little slow but has a nice charm. After the Interval, there is a sense of deja-vu with Babbal Rai trying to woo Rubina and then the game of one-upmanship amongst the suitors of Rubina.[3]"

Tharai Thappattai,"Sannasi (M. Sasikumar) is a multi-talented folk dancer and nadaswaram expert in a village living with his father Samipulavan (G. M. Kumar). Samipulavan was once a great singer and thavil expert who stopped performing singing and playing thavil because of the indecent content in the folk dances by the younger generation in recent years. He also has stopped talking with his son because of the same reason.Sooravalli (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar) is Sannasi's cousin who loves Sannasi very much and expresses her love often for which Sannasi doesn't responds.Both Sooravalli and Sannasi are in the same group of dancers who go to places for performing.
An innocently dressed Karuppaiah (R. K. Suresh) often interrupts the male performers in the group wherever they go, to know where the next dance programme would happen. One day Sannasi gets a phone call from a group of men in a lodge near by. They pay him a lumpsum amount to book his group for a dance programme in a temple in Andaman Nicobar islands. The group goes to Andaman by a passenger ship, stays in the hotel provided by the organizers and performs Karagattam in a temple. The men who organized the dance liked the women dancers and asks Sannasi to show them the girls indirectly asking for sex. Sannasi without uttering any word takes the organizers to the room where the lady dancers are staying and says to them that he has showed the girls as per their wish . Sooravalli who is short tempered fiercefully hits all the organizers knowing that they had asked for sex with the lady dancers including her. The organizers who were drunk at that time were badly injured and in turn they tore the return tickets to main land India taking revenge on them. That night the group of dancers could not find a shelter and sleep in the road. Not knowing how to get back to main land India, they go in search of a job. A building contractor helps them to find a construction work and asks for some percent of money as his commission. Agreed to this the group of dancers work in the construction site only to damage the buildings and the constructions built so far. In the chaos Sooravalli gets hurt by getting her feet pricked by a nail. The building owner gets irritated with the damage and scolds the contractor. The contractor asks them to stop the work and go back. Without any money the dance group was not able to buy even a tea. Soorvalli who could not see Sannasi starving for hunger puts her make-up and dances karagattam,with the wounded feet, in the street asking the thavil players and nadaswaram players to accompany her. Mesmerized by the dance the public gives them enough money with which they return to mainland India. While returning Sooravalli fells ills because of the nail which got pricked in her foot.

Aranmanai 2,"The movie starts with the Amman statue that was guarding the village from evil spirits and negative energy being moved into an underground room during the temple's renovation. At a graveyard somewhere close to the temple a group of tantric practitioners capitalise on the Amman being made dormant to awaken evil spirits for black magic purposes. During the ritual they inadvertently release a demonic entity that they could not contain. The evil spirit then leaves the graveyard in the form of cloud and moves into the village. The village mendicant-holyman notices the evil spirit and chases after it, but could not prevent it from entering the titular palace. Being mute, his pleadings to warn the palace owner (Radha Ravi) is ignored. Later that night, the spirit attacks the owner who then falls and goes into a coma. His elder son Ramesh (Subbu Panchu), arrives with his wife Sandhya (Vinodhini Vaidyanathan) and their son Suresh (Nithin Manivannann). Together with them are his younger brother, Murali (Siddharth) and his fiancé Anitha (Trisha Krishnan). Devadas (Soori) arrives as well, in disguise as his father, Sandhu Bondu Naadimuthu (Soori) who was a doctor and had contact with the land owners.
One night the family driver (Raj Kapoor) is killed. after a few nights, Suresh does crazy things and says that someone is telling him to do so. Also Murali sees his father being elevated above the bed and gets scared. Anitha who also sees these things decides to call her brother, Ravi (Sundar C.). One night Ravi sees Suresh drowning and rescues him. He initially suspects Manju (Poonam Bajwa), who was hired by the family as a nurse for Murali's father, but he soon realizes it is not her since she has a different agenda. After that he sets up cameras around the house. A couple of nights later the elder brother goes missing and Ravi sees it. With the cameras he is able to identify the spirit that is causing havoc. Murali identifies her as Maya (Hansika Motwani), his younger sister.
Maya was loved by all, especially by her father and Murali. She was also the owner of Maya Granites shown in the song Maya Maya. On the day before her marriage, she eloped with one of the workers' son (Vaibhav Reddy) and the whole family was shocked and felt disgraced. Three years later in Bangalore, when Murali sees that she is pregnant, he passes the good news to his father and brother as they arrive to their house. Their father asks Maya to come back home to which she agrees. On the day she was supposed to arrive, Maya didn't show up, and Murali thought she had changed her mind. Later Ravi tells that it's not true. Maya and her husband got off a stop earlier since her elder brother wanted them to arrive home safely. While traveling in a Jeep on the way to their palace, Maya's husband was stabbed by the driver. After that he instructed Maya to go into hiding. But this plan failed when Maya's father arrived and told her to drink poison since she disgraced her family's name and status by marrying someone who belonged to a lower caste. Maya agrees to her father's words with a condition that her husband's life should be spared. After she drank the poison Maya's elder brother killed her husband in front of her which made Maya vow that she will end the male generation in her family, before her father chokes her to death. Ravi also tells that her primary target is Murali, since he told their father and elder brother about her whereabouts and also Suresh. Manju tells that her uncle is a priest and lives near the Kerala border.
Ravi goes with Manju to the priest whose disciples at first refused to offer a helping hand because the priest is just recuperating from myocardial infarction (heart attack). But before they leave, the priest decides to help them and starts the pooja. After a few moments, the priest informs that Maya has possessed someone in the palace and it is revealed to be Anitha. It is also shown that Anitha killed Murali's elder brother and also poisons her father-in-law as an act of revenge, even though he managed to recover from his coma. Ravi decides to find Maya's corpse, while Murali, Suresh, and Manju try to distract Anitha by taking the entire family to a restaurant. Their main goal is to get Anitha's blood and put some holy ink on her hair. They manage to get her blood when she is cutting an apple, and one of the assistants (Manobala) manages to put the ink before getting thrashed by Anitha/Maya. There Anitha goes to the house and tries to kill Murali and Suresh. However it fails and the priest manages to get Maya out of Anitha. Later Ravi and the priest decide to kill the spirit and the only way is to be possessed by the spirit and stab its own corpse. Ravi manages to do it and completes it but the priest gets chest pain and he tells Murali that their only hope is to go to the Amman Pooja that is happening in their village temple as Amman is their final hope. Murali and Suresh get there with Ravi possessed by Maya trying to stop them. When Ravi is about to kill Murali, Amman uses her powers and prevents Maya's spirit from killing Murali and Suresh. Before she leaves, she sees her brother Murali who sheds tears for what had happened to his beloved sister. Before Maya disappears she smiles at the Amman. After this incident, Murali, Suresh and Anitha reunite and Ravi reunites with Manju leaving the Aranmanai in the hands of the caretakers. As everyone leaves the palace, Maya's spirit enters a doll and returns to the palace waiting for the right time to swing back into action. The movie ends with a hint of a sequel."

Despite the very poor infrastructure, Prabhu/Adi manages to find talent in a roadside fish seller Madhi (Ritika Singh), who he notices while she is thrashing the judges during her sister's tournament.
Ignoring Madhi's elder sister Lakshmi (Mumtaz Sorcar) who has been boxing for 8 years, Prabhu offers to train Madhi for a few hours daily. But the two don't get along due to Prabhu's/Adi's ruthless training methods and Madhi's aggressive nature. As a result, Madhi intentionally loses a local match. Prabhu later asks Lakshmi and Madhi's parents, Saamikannu (Kaali Venkat) and Damayanthi (Baljinder Kaur), to send them to stay in hostel with him so their daughters can work hard on training. Madhi misunderstands him, but later regrets when she finds out that Prabhu has sold his bike to buy new training equipment for her. Madhi then dedicatedly starts training with Prabhu and develops feelings for him. On the day of a qualifying match, she reveals her feelings to Prabhu and he promptly rejects her. During the warm-up before the match, a now jealous Lakshmi injures Madhi's hand causing Madhi to lose. Angry, Prabhu thinks that Madhi lost intentionally again and throws her out of training camp.
Dev takes advantage of the situation by calling Madhi to Delhi for a cultural exchange tournament and makes her fight with a heavy weight Russian boxer, who knocks out Madhi in a few seconds. A demotivated Madhi is then approached by Dev with an indecent proposal, to which she reacts by injuring him. Dev takes revenge by getting her arrested on false theft charges.
Prabhu comes to the rescue and bails her out. He later takes Madhi to Delhi to get her a wild-card entry into the World Boxing Championship. Many people in the association, including Lakshmi, accuse Madhi of offering sexual favours to Prabhu. Ignoring all the accusations Madhi works hard and goes on to win the semifinal. On the day of finals, Dev removes Madhi's name from the list and asks Prabhu to resign immediately if he wants to see Madhi in the final, with the same Russian boxer who knocked her out in Delhi. Madhi gets to fight in the final round but is dejected after learning about Prabhu's resignation. She keeps losing points in the early rounds and gets badly injured before Prabhu shows up at the stadium and indicates her to attack her opponent's arms to make her weak. Madhi follows the game plan and knocks out the opponent with seconds to go in the final round. Dev quickly jumps into the ring to take the credit for training Madhi but she punches him and runs to Prabhu. Madhi and Prabhu hug each other, showing their emotional reunion."

Ammu has completed her B.Com and aspires to do her MBA from IIM but is compelled to get married to workaholic corporate executive Shivaprasad ""Prasad"" (Rana Daggubati) because of her family astrologer's dire predictions. After their wedding, Ammu moves to Bangalore as Prasad is settled there. Kutty too relocates to Bangalore for his job while Ajju joins a biker gang as a mechanic in the same city.
Ammu feels lonely as Prasad often goes on long corporate trips and ignores her. Her only solace is the time she gets to spend with her cousins Ajju and Kutty. One day, upon inspecting a room in their apartment that Prasad never lets anyone enter, she is shocked to find it filled with photos, knickknacks and possessions of a woman (Samantha). In thought of not having a place in Prasad's heart and life, she leaves Prasad and returns to her village in sorrow.
Naive Kutty, who wants a traditional, modest, saree-clad girl for a wife, falls in love with an air hostess named Lakshmi (Raai Laxmi) on a flight from Bangalore to Coimbatore.

She gradually wins over a repentant Prasad and soon arranges for him to meet Grace's parents (played by Prakash Raj and Vinaya Prasad). After the meeting, Prasad is able to let go of his past. Ammu forgives him and they get their marital life on track.
Ajju gets a chance to race on the same day that Sarah has to leave for Australia. Rakesh also arrives. With Ammu, Kutty and Prasad cheering for him, he wins the race.

Visaranai,"Pandi (Dinesh Ravi), Murugan (Aadukalam Murugadoss), Afzal (Silambarasan Rathnasamy), Kumar (Pradheesh Raj) are Tamil labourers who are working in Andhra Pradesh and living in a nearby park and working to make ends meet. A Tamil man Muthuvel is shown to be undertaking some operation in Andhra Pradesh along with a group of men. The lives of the four labourers take a turn for worse when they are caught, beaten and tortured brutally in police lock-up for a theft they did not commit, due to police's need to close a high-profile robbery case. The four resist the torture and refuse to confess, but are forced to relent due to the police brutality. However, when produced in court, they speak out the true set of events to the judge. Muthuvel (Samuthirakani), who is shown to be a Police Inspector, helps them go free by translating for them in court and vouching for them. Before the men can leave, Muthuvel enlists their help to kidnap a high-profile auditor K.K (Kishore) who has been handling the black money for an opposing political party in Tamil Nadu. The men are brought back to Tamil Nadu, and Kumar is dropped on the way to Chennai.
The remaining three men are asked by Muthuvel to clean the police station before leaving. The nature of Muthuvel's case is then revealed. The kidnapping was masterminded by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (D.C.P), under directions from the ruling political party of the state, to use K.K in court and take down the opposition party. Meanwhile, the Assistant Commissioner (A.C.P), who is on the payroll of the opposition party, convinces the D.C.P to play a double game and get 3 crores (30 million) rupees from the opposition for dropping the case. However, buying the D.C.P's bluff, the opposition party fears that K.K has given up their secrets and orders the A.C.P to interrogate him, during which he dies from the injuries sustained. A discussion ensues to figure out a way cover up the death as a suicide.
After the meeting, the D.C.P sees Pandi and Afzal in an adjoining bathroom and suspects that they might have overheard the plan. To cover up, they decide to frame Pandi and his friends as convicts in a pending A.T.M robbery case, and eliminate them under the cover of an encounter. Muthuvel, who feels responsible for the three men, is fed up with the corruption and immorality of the events that have transpired and initially refuses to cooperate, but he is coerced because of his deep involvement. During the staged encounter, Afzal is killed, causing Pandi and Murugan to runaway. In the ensuing pursuit, Murugan is shot and killed. Muthuvel chases Pandi and negotiates with him, assuring no harm and promising a spot in front of the media to expose the corruption. Meanwhile, orders arrive from the D.C.P to tie up loose ends and eliminate Muthuvel as well. As the film cuts to black, gunshots are heard, followed by a conversation that reveals the death of both Muthuvel and Pandi. A plan is made for the press coverage of Muthuvel's death 'in the line of duty', alongside photographs of his family to hold the attention and sympathy of the public."

Miruthan,"The Plot opens with a stray dog becoming a violent Alien-like creature, after drinking toxic fumes washed out by a scientific laborarory in Ooty, which then bites a security guard. The security guard turns into a zombie momentarily and starts a chain of human infections via bites.
Back to the present, Karthik (Jayam Ravi) is a Traffic Police Officer in Ooty who avoids all kinds of dangers as he takes care of his younger sister Vidhya (Anikha Surendran), who is in her early teens. Both are orphans but they live with Karthik's Comic Constable Friend Chinnamalai (Kaali Venkat). He is in love with a doctor named Renuka (Lakshmi Menon) but never proposes in all their meetings. Renu is engaged and is about to get married to an NRI named Naveen (Amit Bhargav), who is also Cardiologist. Meanwhile, Karthik's sister is kidnapped and is suspected to be attacked by the zombies. The police of Ooty decides to shoot the people who have turned into zombies. Karthik is also looking for his sister and also kills some zombies. He receives a call in which he is told to arrive at a place to find his sister. There he finds Renu and her group of doctors, including the chief doctor Dharan (Jeeva Ravi) finding a vaccine. Karthik also finds his sister and later comes to know that the doctors are trapped inside the house which is invaded by zombies.
At that moment, the chief doctor Dharan is attacked by a zombie but does not reveal anyone. With Karthik, Dharan, Renu, another doctor Kamal (Raghavan Durairaj), Renu's father and Minister Gurumoorthy (R. N. R. Manohar), Karthik's friend and sister, the group head to Kovai (Coimbatore), they are to use medical equipments to find a cure. When they came near Mettuplayam, they were schocked that zombie has spread in Coimbatore. The zombies get up in the van, and Karthik uses the van to kill the zombies one by one. Minister Gurumoorthy, unknowingly disturbs some zombies and Karthik is lead to shoot them. Then they are forced to take shelter in the mall, opposite to the hospital. Meanwhile, Naveen is inside the hospital trying to find the vaccine. They get hold of a frightened security guard of the mall (Sriman). After a few hours, Dharan turns into a zombie and attacks Karthik's sister. Karthik kills Dharan with his gun but Vidhya does not turn into a zombie despite the fact that she was attacked almost an hour ago. Kamal says that she will be able to help them in finding the vaccine as she has the required antibodies and immunity power. Because of that, Karthik had to escort them to the Hospital which faces the mall. For this, he is using pressurised water from the Mall's Fire Truck knowing that they are allergic to water. Despite the reduced time, Karthik manages to bring everyone safely to the hospital except Renu. He goes back to the mall to bring Renu. But he does that without any water source. So, he gets Renu to the Hospital but is attacked by the zombies while escorting her. He himself slowly turns into a zombie. But he safely escorts her to the hospital before his human feelings lose and also advices Renuka to get rid of him and shoot him. But she is too adamant to know the reason why he had saved her despite the uncaring Naveen's attempts and her timid father and Renu realises his love for her (by seeing a photo in his wallet as per instructions of Vidhya, when she thought that she would die ""that he should be united with the person in the photo"" which is Renuka herself and she comes to know he is the traffic police whom she thought to be good person all long.) but he becomes a complete zombie and attacks her thus Renu shoots him.
The doctors find the required antidote and start converting the zombies back to humans. Later, Karthik, now completely a zombie, is seen on the top of a bus which is going to Chennai, implying that Renuka did not shoot Karthik properly and hence he has survived the attack, alluding towards a possible sequel."
Sethupathi,"Sethupathi (Vijay Sethupathi) is an honest police inspector from Madurai who is awaiting his promotion to ACP. He takes up a case involving the murder of a Sub-inspector named Subburaj. Subburaj was hacked to death by some thugs while on duty, but he was not the target. The actual target was another sub-inspector Kanagavel, who works in the police station where Sethupathi is the inspector. Kanagavel was off-duty on the day he was supposed to be murdered and Subburaj, who is attached to another police station, was filling in for him. Sethupathi finds out that an influential don and politician Vaathiyar (Vela Ramamoorthy) is behind the murder. Kanagavel is married to Vaathiyar's daughter, but it is an unhappy marriage. Therefore, Vaathiyar had decided to kill Kanagavel. Sethupathi arrests Vaathiyar during a temple festival and forces him to travel to Chennai to apply for bail, earning his enmity.

At the fifth count, he shoots one of the boys, leaving him critically injured. Sethupathi is charged with attempt-to-murder and is suspended. However, Sethupathi had no intention of shooting either of the boys and realises that someone had unlocked his gun, which he had thought was locked. He soon finds out that Kanagavel is responsible for unlocking his gun. Kanagavel unlocked the gun and replaced the bullets with dummy ones as part of a plan to put Vaathiyar in jail for life so that he will be free to reconcile with his wife. Sethupathi and his senior official appear before an enquiry to prove his innocence. However, one of the members of the enquiry panel is an ally of Vaathiyar and she tries to influence the panel against Sethupathi, but her double-game is soon exposed and Sethupathi is cleared of all charges. Sethupathi's troubles are still not over; Vaathiyar burns Kanagavel alive and starts targeting Sethupathi and his family. Sethupathi overcomes all the hurdles put by Vaathiyar and his henchmen. Vaathiyar then decides to silence Sethupathi once and for all by sending his henchmen to kill Sethupathi's wife (Remya Nambeesan) and his two children, but Sethupathi's son, who is aware of police work, drives away the henchmen with the help of his father. Infuriated with the failed attempt, Vaathiyar instructs his men to kill the school boy injured by Sethupathi and put the blame on him. However, Sethupathi, aware of Vaathiyar's plan, guards the hospital where the boy is admitted and saves him from Vaathiyar's henchmen.
With Sethupathi returning to work, Vaathiyar's henchmen accept defeat and warn Vaathiyar to leave Madurai for good, but he does not take heed. The film ends with Sethupathi killing Vaathiyar by setting his house on fire."

The words are later found to point to biblical proverbs,thus helping Arul to lead to conclusions that the killer is insane and that he assumed that the victims gave up their lives for the sins committed by their respective wives. He soon figures out that the wives of the kidnapped husbands have links and they all had to do with a guy who studied with them certain years back. There was absolutely no evidence of such a person.

Theri,"Vijay Kumar (Vijay) is the honest and sincere DCP of Chennai. He takes up a case involving the rape and subsequent death of an IT employee Raji. He finds out that the rapist is Ashwin, the son of Labour Minister Vanamaamalai (J. Mahendran). Vijay kills Ashwin and reveals himself as the murderer to Vanamaamalai, who swears to take revenge on him for killing his son. Meanwhile, Vijay falls in love with a medical student Mithra (Samantha Ruth Prabhu) and both eventually get married and lead a happy life. But, Vijay's happiness is short-lived as Vanamaamalai, his younger brother Ratnam (Azhagam Perumal) and their henchmen barge into his house one night and kill Mithra and Vijay's mother (Raadhika). They even brutally assault Vijay and attempt to drown Vijay's baby daughter Niveditha aka Nivi in the bathtub. The dying Mithra manages to rescue Nivi and asks Vijay to take care of her, but not before making him promise that he will quit the police and be a peaceful and loving father to Nivi, following which she dies in Vijay's arms. Vijay fakes his death, changes his name to Joseph Kuruvilla and moves to Kerala with Nivi and his constable friend Rajendran (Rajendran) to protect Nivi from Vanamaamalai and his gang.
Five years later, Vijay is leading a happy life in Kerala with Nivi (Baby Nainika), who is now in kindergarten, and is running a bakery with Rajendran. As per Mithra's dying wish, he gave up violence and raises Nivi to be non-violent. He meets Annie (Amy Jackson), Nivi's class teacher, and both become good friends. Annie soon finds out about that Joseph is none other than the ""late"" Vijay Kumar, but Vijay warns her not to tell Nivi about it. One day, while Nivi is going on an excursion, the brakes of the school bus in which Nivi is travelling fails and the bus plunges into the backwater. Vijay, with the help of Annie, Rajendran and the local people, manages to rescue Nivi and the other children. He finds out that Vanamaamalai, who has found out that he and Nivi are still alive, is responsible for the bus plunging into the backwater in order to kill Nivi. Enraged, he decides to abandon his non-violent principles and destroy Vanamaamalai and his gang once and for all.
Vijay, posing himself as the ""ghost"" of Vijay Kumar, starts eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen one-by-one. He first kills an inspector Karikalan (Stun Siva), who is one of Vanamaamalai's henchmen and was present at the night when Mithra was killed. The police are baffled at the murder as it was done within the police station, and refuse to believe that Vijay committed the murder, since they think that he is dead. The ""mysterious deaths"" continue, with Vijay pushing Ratnam to his death from a high-storey building being constructed by him. Vanamaamalai is accused of killing Ratnam since both had fallen out, forcing him to go into hiding. Finally, Vijay allows himself to be captured by Vanamaamalai's henchmen in order to enter his hideout. After eliminating Vanamaamalai's henchmen, Vijay kills him. The police soon arrive at Vanamaamalai's hideout, only to see his dead body hanging from the ceiling, and with nobody else around, his murder also gets sensationalised in the media as a mysterious murder. It is soon revealed that the Chennai commissioner of police Sibi Chakravarthi (Prabhu Ganesan) is aware that Vijay is alive and secretly re-employs him in the police to reduce crime in Chennai in his ""ghost"" form, taking advantage of the fear the negative elements of the society have for Vijay, while publicly denying that he is still alive.

Manithan,"The film begins with a drunk Rahul Dewan, racing in a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado against an Audi, after he is seduced by a woman in the passenger seat. He loses control and crashes into a wall on the footpath by the road. The film cuts to a court scene where Sakthivel aka Sakthi (Udhayanidhi Stalin), an LLB (law-degree) graduate defending a surgeon against a Public interest litigation (PIL) filed against him after the surgeon had his son operate upon a pregnant woman in his pursuit of Guinness Book of World Records. Sakthi loses the case but decides to move to the capital Chennai to try his luck. He happens to see prominent criminal lawyer Adhiseshan (Prakash Raj) defending Rahul in a sessions court. Rahul is accused of causing death under the influence of alcohol. Adhiseshan convinces the judge that prosecution had no evidence to implicate Rahul and he was being deliberately targeted by the media as he was from a rich family, resulting in Rahul's acquittal.
Adhiseshan, though, is not satisfied with the fee paid by the Dewans. Sakthi, desperate to have some money and fame, decides to pursue the case and files a PIL in the court against Rahul Dewan's acquittal. After initially reprimanding Sakthi for his mistakes in filing the PIL and taking the press reports as an evidence, Justice Dhanapal (Radha Ravi) gives a date for hearing and warns Sakthi to collect some evidence before the hearing. He then runs into Vijay Nair (Krishna Kumar), who claims to have witnessed the accident. Then Sakthi introduces him as a witness in the court and Dhanapal, after cross-examining him, gives a date for the next hearing. He also summons Rahul to be present in the court for the hearing. Sakthi becomes a celebrity overnight and is admired by Moorthy who donates a room in his restaurant to Sakthi for using it as his office. However, Sakthi's plans turn upside down, when Vijay Nair reveals to him that he is no witness, but a crony of Adhiseshan and it was part of a plan to extract more money from Dewan clan. As part of the deal, Nair gives Sakthi his share of the money paid by Dewans to silence Nair. Sakthi gleefully accepts the money and regrets that had he known this plan earlier, he would have demanded more money. Nair turns hostile in the court and Sakthi accepts the statement given by Nair. Dhanapal postpones the judgement for the next hearing. Priya (Hansika Motwani), cousin and fiancee of Sakthi, chides him for compromising on justice for his greed. Sakthi realises his mistake once. Moorthy slaps him for his treachery. He returns the money to Adhiseshan and challenges him to win the case.
With the help of his uncle (Vivek), Sakthi collects the video footage of the Land Cruiser involved in the accident and presents it to the court. Though Adhiseshan counters him that the Land Cruiser was driven by the driver of Dewan family, Sakthi refutes his statement by submitting the necessary evidence. Dhanapal orders the Police to provide a bodyguard for Sakthi after he was seriously beaten up by alleged assistants of Adhiseshan. Sakthi and his friends try to interview a relative of one of the victims, Muthupandi, but he says that he knows nothing. Sakthi and Priya decide to leave, but as they get on the scooter, a lorry hits them, injuring Priya. At the hospital, Muthupandi tells Sakthi that a survivor of the accident stays in Vandavasi and Sakthi and one of his friends decides to leave for Vandavasi. Inspector Selvam tries to sabotage Sakthi's investigation, but is rescued by his bodyguard. Sakthi and Jennifer arrive at Vandavasi, but the police, who captured Muthupandi, kidnap the survivor. The next day, Sakthi reveals that he brought the survivor, thanks to Muthupandi intentionally showing the police the wrong man, and Sakthi prosecutes Selvam and finds that he has botched up the investigation by declaring Kamalakannan as dead and snatching Kamalakannan's hard-earned money to stop him from killing Kannan. Kamalakannan testifies that he woke up that night to see his family lying in a pool of blood and Rahul getting out of the car, and after seeing what he has done, Rahul spotted Kamalakannan and ran him over, so no there will be no witnesses. Kamalakannan survived, with his leg being broken. Dhanapal tells Rahul to come to the podium and orders Kannan to see if Rahul was the driver. Kannan confirms that Rahul was the one who drove the Land Cruiser. After conclusion of arguments and counter-arguments between Adhiseshan and Sakthi, Dhanapal directs Tamil Nadu Police to suspend Selvam and initiate a criminal inquiry against him and also declares Rahul as guilty of the crime and sentences him to fourteen years in jail under Section 304 and under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code. The film ends with Sakthi celebrating with his team while Adhiseshan is crestfallen as he suffers defeat after a long time."

Using them, he manages to impress Sathya (Samantha Ruth Prabhu), his client who hails from Sathyabama's native place Gopalasamudram. Athreya’s close aide Mithran (Ajay) issues an advertisement offering five crores to the one who finds Narayanasamy's watch. Including Mani, many prepare the duplicate of the watch and submit them. But Athreya spots Mani's design accurate and kills him, thereby gaining possession of the watch.
Athreya is shocked to know that the watch can only help him travel back and forth only for 24 hours and decides to revive Mani. Mithran places the watch on Mani's right hand and leaves. Mani wakes up next morning and is shocked as he wore the watch on his left hand. He travels back to last night and secretly follows Mithran.

Arul was a renowned film director until he fell out with the producer of his latest directorial film, because of which the film never released. To overcome his sorrow, he became a chronic alcoholic and started harassing Yazhini. Though Yazhini often threatens to divorce Arul for his behaviour, she changes her mind each time due to her love for him.
Michael, an artifact dealer, is forced to marry Ponni, despite being in love with a widow Malar (Pooja Devariya). However, Malar has no love for Michael, merely considering their relationship as friends with benefits. Michael, openly reveals to Ponni that he is not interested in being her husband and ignores her.

When Arul refuses, the producer himself steps in and asks Arul to pay him ₹4,00,00,000 to get his film released. Michael and Jagan, with the help of their friend Ramesh (Karunakaran), steal a temple idol and sell it for ₹4,00,00,000, so that Arul's film can be released. Unfortunately, the producer has already decided to remake Arul's film with an entirely new cast and with his own brother as the director. Arul confronts the producer, who tries to kill him.

In order to get the money, Michael and Jagan again team up with Ramesh to steal an idol from a Kerala temple and sell it. However, Ramesh drugs Michael and runs away with the idol. Michael is arrested the following morning, but he manages to escape from the police and returns to Chennai. On confronting Ramesh, he finds out that Jagan was responsible for getting him arrested at Kerala. Jagan was also in love with Ponni and was disgusted at the way Michael treated her. When Michael was in jail, Jagan declared his love for Ponni, who reciprocated, but was forced to return to her village the next day as she was unable to decide between Michael and Jagan. Jagan then decided to get Michael arrested so that Ponni could leave Michael for good and start a new life with him. After confronting Ponni over her love for Jagan, both Michael and she decide to forget everything that happened and plan to leave Chennai to start a new life.
Arul, who has successfully acquired the production rights for his film, decides to once again convince Yazhini to return to him.

As Arul is taken to prison, he contacts Yazhini and pretends that he has once again returned to his drunken habits as he does not want her to suffer with the stigma of being a criminal's wife, effectively ending their relationship.
In the end, with their respective husbands out of the way, Ponni and Yazhini relish their newly found freedom by enjoying the rain.

Sakkarai asks Pushpa to sign the divorce notice, but she refuses to sign unless Jacket tells her to do so. To add to Sakkarai's woes, Pushpa even moves in with him.
Meanwhile, Murugan falls in love with Archana (Nikki Galrani), the daughter of the local tea shop owner whose main ambition is to become a police officer. Archana's father finds out about Murugan's close association with Jacket and asks him to give ₹10,00,000 to Jacket so that his daughter could become a sub-inspector and also asks him not to tell Archana as she wants to get the SI job in an honest way. Later that day, Jacket goes to hospital to visit a minister Shanmugasundaram (Vittal), who is on his deathbed. Before dying, Shanmugasundaram tells him about ₹500,00,00,000 that he acquired illegally, but wants him to use it for good purposes. This is heard by Jacket's brother-in-law Bhootham (Ravi Mariya), who also wants the money, but for his own benefit. He chases Jacket on his way home to find out the location where the money is kept, but Jacket meets with an accident during the chase and loses his memory, beginning to act like a 10-year old.
Archana eventually gets the SI job, but soon finds out that she got the job on merit. Thinking that Murugan had cheated her father, she immediately orders him to give back her father's money, failing which he would be thrown into prison. Murugan and Sakkarai find out that Jacket has lost his memory, but manage to get him discharged from the hospital. They train him to tell Archana that he has received the money from Murugan and to tell Pushpa to sign the divorce notice so that both their problems would be solved. But their plan backfires completely as Jacket tells Pushpa what he was supposed to tell Archana, making Pushpa realise that Jacket has lost his memory and refuses to sign the divorce notice again. Jacket also inadvertently gets caught in the middle of a protest against Marudhamuthu and is eventually kidnapped by Bhootham and his men. Murugan is caught at the scene of the kidnapping and is arrested by Archana.
At Bhootam's hideout, Jacket irritates him and his men with his childish behaviour. In a fit of rage, Bhootham kicks Jacket, making him unconscious. But Jacket regains his memory after gaining consciousness, much to Bhootham's happiness. Bhootham asks him to tell where the money is, but instead Jacket starts telling all the events leading up to the event where he met Shanmugasundaram in the hospital, and keeps repeating the story from the beginning if he is interrupted, much to his irritation. At this juncture, Murugan and Archana, who have both found out that Bhootham has kidnapped Jacket, arrive. Murugan manages to stop Jacket's repetition, getting him to tell in front of Archana that he indeed received money from Murugan, but since the DGP Sathasivam (Venkat), to whom he was supposed to pay the bribe, refused to accept the bribe, he gave the money to a contractor. Jacket also tells that he has managed to convince Pushpa to sign the divorce notice. He then reveals the location of the money to Bhootham, which is stored in an abandoned mansion. Murugan, Archana, Sakkarai, Jacket, Bhootham and even Marudhamuthu, who has also found out about the money, go to the mansion. A fight ensues between Murugan, Archana, Sakkarai and Jacket on one side and Bhootham and Marudhamuthu on the other side over the money, which ends with the former successfully getting the money.
In the end, with all problems solved, Murugan and Archana enter into a romantic relationship, while Sakkarai is to get married to Hamsavali during another mass-marriage function organised by Jacket. But before Sakkarai can tie the thali around Hamasavali's neck, the priest asks him if he is Pushpa's husband to which he accidentally says yes, causing Hamsavali to stop the wedding again."

Appa,"Dhayalan (Samuthirakani), Singamperumal (Thambi Ramaiah) and Nadunilayan (Namo Narayana) live in the same community, a town near Neyveli, Tamil Nadu. They are expecting the arrival of their respective children and they all have different perspectives in child rearing. Dhayalan makes his wife to go for a traditional delivery at home, while Singamperumal instructs the doctor to perform a C-section on a scheduled date and time, in order for his child to have the best possible horoscope, pre-calculated based on the date and time of birth. All three of them have baby boys. Dhayalan names his son Vetriswaran, Singamperumal names his son Chakravarthy and Nadunilayan names his son Mayilvaganam.
Trouble brews at Dhayalan's home, when he refuses to put his son at the age of two in a play school. Dhayalan's wife wants their child to be sent to a specific play school since the other children in the neighborhood are being enrolled there and is considered prestigious. Dhayalan's view is that the toddler need to enjoy his childhood by playing and learning and join a school at the age of 5. But after a heated argument, Dhayalan's wife attempts suicide for this and he agrees against his conscience and enrolls their son in the play school.
As the boys grow, their fathers imbue different social aspects into their children. Dhayalan teaches his son to be friendly to society, trust people, enjoy every moment of life and do good to the community. He teaches his son to follow a path of truth and integrity, considering human values above everything else. He also teaches his son how to behave friendly and talk socially with others. Singamperumal teaches his son not to trust anyone and focus only on academics, asks him to follow a timetable for everything and the goal is to achieve state topper in Class 10th and 12th exams, join a medical degree in a prestigious college and take up a master's medical degree in one of the United States's top medical colleges. Nadunilayan teaches his son not to stand out on any particular aspect and to take a centrist position in everything. His ideology is to live a low-profile life because he understands if one is very good or very bad in any of the aspects, he attracts the attention of society.
When Vetriswaran is in second grade, Dhayalan is furious with the teaching approach of this school, gets into an argument with the school management, and moves his son out of the private school to a government school. Dhayalan's wife is angered by this event and separates from him; she goes to her parent's house and seeks divorce and custody of her son. However, her father rejects this idea and lets Dhayalan have custody of his son.
The children grow into boys and become teenagers. Vetriswaran grows into a self-confident teenager excelling in both sports and studies; Chakravarthy as a studious but timid and indecisive boy whereas Mayilvaganam grows up with an inferiority complex about his height and studies.
Dhayalan identifies that Vetriswaran is interested in swimming and enrolls him in swimming classes, it leads to achieving a Guinness World Record at the age of 16. Dhayalan also identifies the ability of Mayilvaganam to write poems, compiles all his works and sends them to a leading lyricist (Pa. Vijay). Mayilvaganam's book gets a good recognition and he is felicitated by the renowned persons of the industry. Chakravarthy also joins at Dhayalan's backyard hut for children when his father is not at home, the three becomes friends with Nandhini and Rashita. They study together and pass 10nth examinations.
Singamperumal's ideology is that dedication plus meditation plus concentration is education, Chakravarthy tops 10th class with 99% and his father enrolls him in one of the strictest higher secondary boarding schools in a distant locality. Chakravarthy is given a target by his father to top in Class 12th as well. He longs for the affection of his mother in the boarding school, succumbs to the rigorous rules, torture by staffs in a dark room and unforgiving pressure of school management. He calls Vetriswaran and the gang of children decides to meet him. They help him to sneak out and have fun but this is found out by the management and he faces repercussions.
Singamperumal receives a call that his son attempted suicide. Singamperumal who is in a shock with Dhayalan reaches the hospital, the whole management convinces that nothing serious has happened. Kumaran (Sasikumar), a famous doctor from the hospital, informs Dhalayan that Chakravarthy already died 8 hours ago and was murdered by the School officials for complaining after a night long torture. The management publicize that student Chakravarthy committed suicide because of a love failure but an angry student who is Chakravarthy's roommate tells the media the truth. While, Dhalayan reports the incident with evidence of a letter the child has written for his father. Chakravarthy's friends are devastated. The story ends with the moral that children should be cherished and loved not ignored and kept pressured."

Kabali,"A Kuala Lumpur–based don Kabaleeswaran alias Kabali (Rajinikanth) is released after spending 25 years in prison on a false charge of starting a massacre at a local Hindu temple that killed many, including his wife Kumudhavalli alias Kumudha (Radhika Apte). He immediately resumes charge of his old gang and soon confronts Loganathan alias Loga (Mime Gopi), a drug smuggler. Loga insults Kumudha, saying that she would have been sold into prostitution had she been alive. In retaliation, Kabali rams his car into Loga, killing him; however, the incident makes him believe that his wife may be still alive. Later, Kabali survives an assassination attempt by Tamizh Kumaran alias Kumaran (Kalaiyarasan), whose father Tamilmaaran (Charles Vinoth) was killed by Kabali when Kumaran was a young boy. The next day, at a function organised by the Free Life Foundation School, a school started by Kabali's friend Ameer (John Vijay) to reform youngsters involved in criminal activities, Kabali talks about his past.
Kabali was the protege of Tamilmaaran's father Tamilnesan (Nassar), a don who fought for the rights of the Tamil Malaysians. Tamilnesan was killed by Veerasekaran alias Veera (Kishore), who was also a part of Tamilnesan's gang, but disliked his rules such as not involving in illegal activities like drug smuggling and prostitution. Following Tamilnesan's death, Kabali took charge of Tamilnesan's gang. But Veera manipulated Tamilmaaran by telling him that he, being Tamilnesan's son, should lead the gang and not Kabali. Tamilmaaran invited Kabali and a pregnant Kumudha for a temple function. However, this was revealed to be a trap as Veera and his men confronted Kabali and Kumudha at the function. In the ensuing scuffle, Kabali was brutally attacked while Kumudha was shot and seemingly killed. Kabali then killed Tamilmaaran for his betrayal in front of a young Kumaran and was soon arrested on a false charge of instigating the massacre.
Kumaran, after hearing Kabali's speech, realises his mistake and apologises to him. He tells him that Velu (R. Amarendran), one of Veera's henchmen who was present at the temple massacre, is aware of what happened to Kumudha. Kabali then leaves for Thailand, where Velu is residing. On confronting Velu, he learns that his daughter is still alive. At this juncture, Kabali is confronted by Yogi (Dhansika), a contract killer hired by Veera and his boss Tony Lee alias Tony (Winston Chao), who heads the rival Gang 43 in Kuala Lumpur, to eliminate Kabali. But Yogi instead kills the men who had come with her and reveals herself to Kabali as his daughter, who had been raised by Velu. She also tells him that Kumudha is still alive and is living with a French family in Puducherry. Kabali and Yogi then leave for Puducherry, where, after several days of searching, they reunite with Kumudha and spend a few days with her there. While in Puducherry, Kabali and his family are attacked by men sent by Tony. However, Kabali and Yogi fight them off and escape safely with Kumudha.
Kabali and his family soon return to Kuala Lumpur, where he is told that Ameer has been severely injured in a car accident set up by Tony; his henchman Jeeva (Dinesh) was brutally chopped to pieces by Tony after refusing to join the Gang 43; and the Gang 43 had destroyed the Free Life Foundation School and started to control the Kuala Lumpur underworld, eliminating any gang who dared to oppose them. On hearing all this, Kabali decides to finish Veera and Tony once and for all. He and his family attend the 100th birthday party for a respected Malaysian don Ang Lee, who had invited all gangs, including the Gang 43. At the party, Kabali starts a shootout with the help of Kumaran, which ends with him killing Veera and Tony.

Vasu, who is from a small town in Tamil Nadu, joined the BSF after his graduation to avoid working in his father's (Raj Kapoor) provision store and was posted at the India-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir. One day, he encountered a young Kashmiri Muslim girl Khanum (Ranya Rao) and immediately got attracted to her. After some days, Khanum reciprocated Vasu's feelings, but sadly walked away when Vasu asked her to marry him. The next morning, two jawans were decapitated by the Pakistan Army (which was reported at the beginning of the film), forcing all Pakistanis in Kashmir to return to Pakistan due to rising anti-Pakistan sentiment. Vasu, who was tasked with the responsibility to ensure that all Pakistanis returned safely, was shocked when he found out that Khanum is a Pakistani from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, who had come to India to visit her grandfather. Later, the bus in which Khanum was travelling was burnt by protestors just a few kilometres from the border, however Khanum managed to survive. Vasu took her to her home in PoK safely via an unguarded border crossing, but was soon caught by the Pakistan Army for infiltrating into their country and imprisoned.
In the present day, Vasu finds out that along with him, twenty-three other BSF jawans are held prisoner by the Pakistan Army. One day, he is made to fight one of the imprisoned BSF jawans (Ajay Rathnam). He manages to defeat the jawan, but is then taken to a nearby cliff by the Pakistan Army to be shot. However, a sympathetic Pakistan Army officer, whose daughter's illness was successfully treated by Indian doctors, secretly allows him to escape. Vasu goes to Khanum's village, where he witnesses Khanum's family being killed by a cruel anti-Indian Pakistan Army commander Razzaq Ali Khan (Shaji Chaudhary), who feels that Khanum is a traitor for loving the Indian Vasu. Vasu rescues Khanum and both of them leave for the Indian border, with Razzaq and the Pakistan Army in pursuit. He manages to subdue the armymen as well as Razzaq, but chooses not to kill Razzaq. Razzaq, while accepting defeat, reveals that his opinion of India and Indians will not change. At this, Vasu forcefully replies that despite being an Indian, he does not hate Pakistan and Pakistanis and that the misguided hatred between the two countries only aggravates the India-Pakistan conflict.

It is then revealed that Dharmadurai is a general doctor and was the first graduate from his village, having pursued his MBBS from Madurai Medical College. During his college days, he was part of a group of friends that included Subhashini (Tamannaah Bhatia) and Stella (Srushti Dange). Both of them were in love with Dharmadurai, and while Stella openly revealed her feelings for him, Subhashini kept her feelings to herself. He was influenced by one of his lecturers Dr. Kamaraj (Rajesh), who believed in serving the poor and helpless in the villages instead of running after money and foreign employment. Inspired by Dr. Kamaraj's ideas, the three friends decided to stay back in India after graduation, but they soon lost contact with each other. Badly requiring Stella's and Subhashini's support and guidance for his current troubles, Dharmadurai manages to get their current addresses from his old college. First, he goes to Stella's house, only to find out that she is no more, having lost her life in a car accident. Then, he goes to the hospital where Subhashini is working. Subhashini, who is now married to a Hyderabad-based doctor, is alarmed at the change in Dharmadurai. Dharmadurai tells her why he had become an alcoholic.
Following his graduation, Dharmadurai had returned to his village and had set up a clinic there. One day, he encountered Anbuselvi (Aishwarya Rajesh), a farm labourer who had brought some sick elderly village women to his clinic. He was immediately attracted to Anbuselvi and soon asked permission from her father Paraman (M. S. Bhaskar) to marry her, who agreed. Anbuselvi also agreed to marry Dharmadurai and their marriage was fixed. But Dharmadurai's brothers demanded 50-sovereigns gold ornaments and ₹5,00,000 as dowry from Paraman, who refused to accept their demand and called off the marriage. Heartbroken, Anbuselvi committed suicide. An enraged Dharmadurai, realising that his brothers were the cause of the end of his marriage and Anbuselvi's death, thrashed them mercilessly and was about to kill them, only to be stopped by Pandiyamma. Betrayed and heartbroken, Dharmadurai shut down his clinic and took to alcoholism.
Subhashini, after hearing Dharmadurai's story, takes him to her apartment and nurses him back to sobriety. Following Dharmadurai's recovery, Subhashini reveals to him that she has decided to divorce her husband as he had killed her unborn child, by mixing abortion pills, in the milk she consumed without her knowledge, when she was pregnant, since she had refused to abort the baby and move abroad with him to France as he had desired. She also adds that she is in love with him since their college days. Dharmadurai reciprocates Subhashini's feelings for him and the two enter a live-in relationship, after she divorces her husband. He also resumes his practice in that very town and soon becomes famous for his work towards the poor, helpless and downtrodden. One day, Dr. Kamaraj, who is blind now, upon hearing about Dharmadurai's work, visits him. On the advice of Dr. Kamaraj, he and Subhashini decide to get married. Subashini gets pregnant with Dharmadurai's child. Subhashini also advises him to return to his village, give back the money in bag to his brothers and also to tell them and mother Pandiyamma that he is going to get married. Dharmadurai agrees and visit back his village.
At his village, Dharmadurai learns that his family had to vacate their house as they were forced to sell it to compensate the villagers, who had found out that their money had been stolen. When he goes to the place where his mother and brothers are now living (a hut in the middle of a field), one of his brothers knocks him out with a spanner, enraged that he had brought them to poverty by stealing the chit fund money. But when he realizes that he had brought back the money, he repents his action. Pandiyamma rushes Dharmadurai to hospital, where he is treated by his batch mate, whom he had attacked in the college. While recuperating at the hospital, he gets a call from Subhashini, asking him to return as soon as possible, and that both Subhashini and the unborn baby are waiting for him."

On the downside the story the director keeps on establishing that the hero is seeing ghosts in scene after scene, thereby diluting the fear factor. Vishaka Singh’s ghost character seems to have so much power to influence the hero, making him see ghosts and is with him all the time and it defies logic why she waits till the very end to kill him.

Kuttrame Thandanai,"Ravi, a young man suffering from tunnel vision, works as a collection boy in a credit card collection office. Anu is his senior officer, and also a close friend. Ravi lives in a housing colony, which is surrounded by many flats. He lives in the first floor and opposite to his house in the ground floor lives Swetha, a young woman who appears to be modern and carefree. Ravi always watches her from his balcony and sometimes watches her secretly. She is often visited by a few men. One of them is her boss Vijay Prakash, who brings her a gift and the other seems to be her boyfriend Arun. One day Ravi sees Arun coming out of her house angry and stares at him as he drives away.
Ravi is getting treatment for his eye condition and the lady Doctor says his condition could only get worse in the future and needs an eye transplant, which would cost him ₹. 3,20,000. As he doesn't have enough money, he tries to apply for a loan from his boss, which is rejected.
One night, Ravi sees Vijay Prakash coming out of Swetha's house with panic and gets back inside suddenly and locks the door. Ravi gets suspicious and goes down and enquires him about Swetha. He calls him inside and shows him Swetha,who is lying in pool of blood. Ravi decides that Vijay Prakash has killed Swetha and is angry at him. But Vijay Prakash offers him a deal to remain quiet, despite claiming that he did not kill her and if his name is involved in her death, then it may affect is name and business in the society. So in order to get his eye condition cured, Ravi agrees to remain quiet and takes ₹. 3,20,000 from Vijay Prakash. Vijay and Ravi part ways.
Ravi visits the hospital to pay the money for his treatment, but is told that the full amount for surgery will be ₹. 4,82,000 instead of ₹. 3,20,000 due to some miscellaneous charges. Disappointed Ravi calls Vijay prakash for more money but he refuses to pay any more saying that their deal is over. Meanwhile, police start investigation and start enquiring everyone in the colony and finally visit his house too. He initially says he doesn't know anything, but as he is angry on Vijay Prakash for not giving him money, he informs the police that he saw a man near Swetha's house on the night of the murder.
The police takes him to the station and begin to enquire, at the same time Arun (Swetha's boyfriend) is in the station applying for anticipatory bail, saying that he never knew anyone named Swetha.

An employee says him that if he pays ₹. 5,00,000 extra as a bribe, his name will pushed up the order and his surgery will take place soon.
Ravi is Clueless about what to do. One night he is met by a stranger who was sent by Arun's advocate and he offers him a deal to remain quiet in the court, as Ravi is the only witness in this case. Ravi agrees for a deal of ₹. 5,00,000 but Arun's side offer him only Rs.1,00,000 as advance and the remaining money after the hearing of the case. Ravi half heartedly agrees and takes one lakh.

Ravi returns ₹. 1,00,000 to them and returns home. His house owner asks him to vacate his house so he starts packing his things.
Ravi has a secret mobile phone in which the wallpaper is a photo of him and Swetha together. It is then revealed that Ravi and Swetha were in a relationship and Swetha started avoiding him after knowing about his eye condition. Also she turns out to be unfaithful, sleeping with many men for her pleasure and profits. This enrages Ravi and he asks her to come with him and he is ready to accept her. She refuses and insults Ravi. So Ravi kills her in a fit of rage and escapes.

Iru Mugan,"An elderly Malaysian man suddenly goes ballistic and kills several Indian officers in a span of five minutes at the Indian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, before collapsing. A tattoo of a love symbol is present at the back of his neck, leading RAW officials to conclude that it is the handiwork of a criminal scientist named Love, whose identity and whereabouts are unknown to anyone except Akhilan Vinod (Vikram), a suspended RAW agent whose wife Meera George (Nayantara), a leading computer analyst at RAW, was killed by Love four years ago. RAW chief Malik (Nassar) tracks down Akhilan and convinces him to join the investigation. On viewing the video footage of the attack, Akhilan comes to the conclusion that the elderly Malaysian man had taken a mysterious performance-enhancing drug which allowed him to attack the Indian officials and decides to investigate the matter further in Malaysia. Since Akhilan is under suspension, Malik assigns him as a deputy to a junior RAW agent Aayushi (Nithya Menen), who is officially assigned to handle the case, and the two of them leave for Kuala Lumpur.
In Kuala Lumpur, Akhilan and Aayushi learn that the mysterious drug is inhaled using an asthma inhaler. Further investigations lead them to Peter (Karunakaran), a scientist who is on Love's payroll. Peter turns approver and tells them about the drug, which is called ""Speed"". The drug causes a person who inhales it to have extraordinary strength for five minutes before falling unconscious, and if the person inhales the drug again within a few hours, he/she will suffer a massive heart attack. Peter also reveals that a shipment of Speed inhalers is to be dispatched to Love within the next fifteen minutes. Akhilan and Aayushi pursue the lorry carrying the inhalers. But a lorry driver inhales Speed and subdue the duo, who are then taken to Love's hideout. As Akhilan moves to arrest Love (Vikram), who turns out to be transgender, he is knocked out by none other than Meera, who is shockingly still alive, has been working for Love as a computer hacker, and now goes by the name of Rosy. It is then revealed that Meera suffers from retrograde amnesia after being shot in the head four years ago and that Love took advantage of her situation to employ her as a computer hacker. She has no mind of her own, following whatever Love says. However, when Love orders her to kill Akhilan and Aayushi, she instead points the gun at Love, and calls the police, who arrest Love. Meera then reveals that she had been forced to take Speed by Love to work faster, but the drug caused her old memories, including those with Akhilan, to return, and she soon regained her full memory after continuous use of the drug.
Love manages to obtain a Speed inhaler while in custody and inhales it, helping her to escape and destroy the entire police station, killing everyone present including Aayushi. Akhilan finds out that Love had made a satellite call to Chang, the Transport Minister of Malaysia who had allowed Love to send shipments of Speed inhalers to India to perpetrate terror attacks there in return for money. He rushes to the hospital where Chang is admitted and interrogates him. During the interrogation, Love sneaks into the hospital and hiding in the AC vent, sprays a neurotoxic gas in Chang's room, causing Akhilan and Chang to get paralysed. She then kills Chang and puts the knife on Akhilan's hand, framing him as Chang's assassin. Now a wanted criminal, Akhilan, despite being paralysed, somehow manages to escape from the hospital and the Malaysian police.
Akhilan and Meera then decide to finish off Love once and for all using Love's kill switch activation device which had been restored and hidden by Aayushi before she was killed. However, as the device can only be opened with Love's fingerprint, they plan on obtaining her fingerprint. They sneak into an illegal airfield owned by Chang, where Love is planning to leave for India with the shipments of Speed inhalers. Akhilan inhales Speed and fights Love, who has also inhaled Speed, and manages to get her fingerprint before collapsing after the drug's effect wears off. On regaining consciousness, he finds out that Love has already left for India. He then uses the fingerprints to open the kill switch activation device, deactivates Meera's kill switch and kills all of Love's henchmen, including those piloting the plane. The plane crashes into a remote jungle, killing Love, destroying the Speed shipments and thus averting a major terrorist attack.
One month later, Akhilan and Meera are seen enjoying a holiday cruise sponsored by the Government of Malaysia as a reward for killing Love. After discussing their future plans, Akhilan reveals he has kept a Speed inhaler and inhales it."

Sadhuram 2,"Vishal (Riaz) and Dr.Vasudevan (Yog Japee) wake up one day to find out that they both are stuck inside a square room devoid of any furniture. The only other element in the room apart from the two of them is the dead body of a man lying in the middle of the room, blood soaked. Vishal and Dr.Vasudevan do not know each other. Soon, Vishal realises that there is a tape recorder near him, he finds a cassette in his pocket, which he plays. The cassette welcomes him to the SQUARE and tells him that his only way of escaping is by finding a clue that only the guy opposite him can see. Soon, Dr.Vasudevan plays the cassette from his pocket and the recording again welcomes him to the SQUARE and tells him that he has been doing a lot of good by saving lives as a Doctor and yet he has committed a grave mistake which he is now getting punished for. He is told that there is only 8 hours remaining for him to escape and his escape would only be by killing the one opposite him.
Vishal, unwilling to cooperate with Dr.Vasudevan cries, screams asking the kidnapper to let him go. Finally coming to terms with their capture, encouraged to think objectively by Dr.Vasudevan, Vishal gives in. They both start working together to find out ways to escape by charting the clues the kidnapper gives.
Meanwhile, on another plane, Siva, working in a multi-national company is told that he has been selected as the ""Employee of the Decade"" and will have to collect his coveted award from their Delhi Headquarters. He comes home to a good news that his wife – Dhivya (Suja Varunee), who is pregnant has conceived twin babies. Overly rejoiced, the couple celebrate their good luck.
As Dr.Vasudevan and Vishal discuss, recall and think, we uncover their personal lives. Dr.Vasudevan a reputed Doctor from a Government Medical Centre is married and has a teenage daughter. But he has an ongoing relationship with one of his trainee students – Dr.Preethi (Sanam Shetty) While he is honest for the most part of his professional life, he is threatened by another trainee student Dr. Shankar (Brihadish Kaushik) to re-write a Postmortem report of a rape victim in favour of the accused (an MP’s son). He is threatened with photos of him with Dr. Preethi. Scared, Dr. Vasudevan sells out.
Vishal on the other hand is a photographer who takes pictures of people in their intimate moments, mostly done on request by certain clients. One such assignment he was given by Dr. Shankar, to follow and take pictures of Dr.Vasudevan along with Dr.Preethi. Dr. Vasudevan gets shocked knowing Vishal already knows him and is partly the reason why he is in the SQUARE.
Meanwhile, Siva and his wife Dhivya prepare to leave to Delhi to receive his award and their flight meets with a tragic accident.
Back in the square, Dr.Vasudevan tells Vishal that a few months earlier a Lawyer was killed brutally in a similar fashion of the dead man in the middle of the room. He says he was suspected of that murder as he was the Lawyer who had demanded he change the Postmortem report. Although his innocence was proved, one CBCID Police officer Aadhi (Birla Bose) stills suspected Dr.Vasudevan.
Upon getting a certain lead, long after the case got over, Aadhi goes in search of the killer (then deemed Serial killer) sure that it was Dr.Vasudevan. The killer escapes from his clutches, in the process gravely injuring him, puncturing his vocal cord. Long after, Aadhi still tries to pin the whole case on Dr.Vasudevan hoping to catch him at his weakest.
Vishal and Dr.Vasudevan get suspicious that their kidnapper might be Dr.Shankar. Dr.Vasudevan comes to know that his wife and daughter have been kidnapped by him too, as a security measure in case Dr.Vasudevan tries to escape. Heart-broken and with no way out Dr.Vasudevan starts realising the value of his family. The love they have for him and the love he has for them.
We go back in time to see that Dhivya finds out that Siva is terminally ill and he has been undergoing treatment without telling her a word about it. She breaks down and cries. Siva tells her that not everyone gets the best in life. He asks her to appreciate what they’ve got in life.
CBCID Aadhi goes to Dr.Vasudevan’s office suspecting something. Inside, Dr.Shankar holds Dr.Vasudevan’s wife and daughter captive. They try to escape and hearing gunshot, Aadhi arrives at the spot. Shankar escapes from him and heads elsewhere.
Dr.Vasudevan, unable to wait for rescue any longer and losing patience decides to break free by cutting his leg free from the chain. Vishal tries to stop him. Dr. Vasudevan shoots Vishal like the kidnapper commanded earlier and breaks away to leave the square. Vishal regains consciousness and realises the Doctor had carefully shot him on his shoulder so as not to mortally injure him. He tries to escape when the dead body in his midst wakes up. It is Siva and he is the mastermind behind the whole square.
Siva who upon recovering from his flight accident, finds out about the girl’s rape and how the lawyer, Dr.Shankar and Dr.Vasudevan played their part in defending the convict. He realises that Vishal was instrumental in instigating this and spoiling several other lives by clicking pictures of their intimate moments. He decides to destroy all their lives. He kills the lawyer first, pushes Dr.Shankar to kidnap Vishal and Dr.Vasudevan and thereafter Dr.Vasudevan’s wife and kid. Dr. Shankar and Aadhi have a tough fight at the end of which Dr.Shankar kills Aadhi. He comes to the square to finish the two of them. But Vishal kills him in the process.
In the end, Siva wakes up from his act, tells Vishal that all he had to do was cooperate and work with Dr.Vasudevan to find his escape route which is written right on his back. Siva tells him that he has lost and he deserves to rot in the square. Siva leaves the square promising to return with others who don’t appreciate their lives."

Poochi tells about Saroja to Vairam who promises to help him woo her. Poochi then devises a plan, and makes her talk on the phone to a great poet Vairamuthu, who is actually Vairam. However, he soon realises that Saroja is not good at singing from any angle though continuing to support her. Saroja remains close to Poochi as she wants to enter the singing industry without knowing the true fact.
The train then stops at Jhansi where Central Minister Rangarajan (Radha Ravi) boards the train along with his two bodyguards. One of them, Nandhakumar (Harish Uthaman) doesn't get well along Poochi and Saroja. He also gets humiliated by the minister in front of Poochi and he wants to take revenge.

He vows to murder them. Meanwhile, at Nagpur Jn. few robbers board the train without the knowledge of anyone as the driver celebrates his retirement.
Next morning, Srisha's mother spots Saroja along with Poochi and asks him to call singer Vairamuthu in front of them which leads to the truth. Saroja, now devastated asks him never to show his face again. When he tries to apologize her, he is confronted by Nandhakumar, who locks him in a room. The train is stopped midway after hitting some wild bulls, the reason for which was blamed upon the assistant driver who failed to alert the driver due to his sobriety. Nandhakumar tries to attack Saroja but she escapes. Due to a fight between the guard of the train and the assistant driver, a green flag was waved. The driver notices and thinking that the assistant driver has fully checked the brakes' connection, he starts the train. As the train starts accelerating, Saroja is unable to board the passenger compartment in the moving train so she boards on the engine. At the same time, the guard and the assistant driver fall off the train which leaves them behind. A message is passed onto the railway administrator that the guard is not on the train. However, the driver, numb from thinking of the incident does not hear it. After a few moments, the driver dies of heart attack, and while dying pushes the controls forward making the train speed up, which is watched by Saroja much to her horror. The train starts to skip stations much to the alarm of the station masters and the railway administrator. At the same time, the burglars attack the passengers, and order not to stop the train. The passengers get terrified due to the high speed. Poochi then overpowers Nandhakumar and attempts to save Saroja. He kills all the burglars and gives Saroja a walkie talkie for communication. Nandhakumar tries to kill Poochi but is himself killed by the edge of an oncoming rail tunnel.
News spreads like fire that the train driver is dead and the train is hijacked. Many mistake the robbers for terrorists and Saroja as their leader. Officers from the police and railway administration are given responsibility to bring down the train. When they realise that the train is not hijacked but out of control, they take help from Poochi and Saroja to stop the train by guiding Saroja on how to turn on the emergency brake. However, due to a short circuit earlier, the brakes do not work. They devise a plan to detach the engine from the passenger compartment. Poochi is successful after a long attempt in doing so and he jumps to the locomotive to save Saroja. Saroja realises her love for Poochi. At Chennai Central Railway Station, the whole station is evacuated as the oncoming train approaches. The locomotive crashes into the station and both Poochi and Saroja are injured, but alive. The detached passenger compartments arrive in Chennai, safe with passengers unscathed. They are interviewed by the media, and Poochi is named a national hero."
Aandavan Kattalai,"Faced with several debts, a village accountant Ganthi Arumugam (Vijay Sethupathi) leaves his village near Madurai to head to Chennai with his best friend Muthupandi Selvam alias Pandi (Yogi Babu) to get all the documents necessary for going to London, where they plan to make money to pay off their debts. They approach two middlemen to help them get the passport and British tourist visa necessary for them to go to London. The middlemen claim that the British Deputy High Commission would prefer to give tourist visas to those who are already married, so the duo are forced to add their ""wife's"" name while applying for the passport, with Ganthi adding his ""wife's"" name as Karmeghakuzhali, following a suggestion from their real estate broker, Murugesan (Singampuli). However, Ganthi's visa application is rejected, forcing him to remain in Chennai and take up a job as an accountant with a drama troupe Stray Factory, run by Master (Nassar), while Pandi passes his visa interview and leaves for London with the help of a passport officer, Kumar (S. S. Stanley).
With his hardwork and sincerity, Gandhi soon becomes the favourite employee of Master and is made to act in his plays. Eventually, Stray Factory are invited to perform in London, leaving Gandhi in a bind as he now needs to get his ""wife's"" name removed from his passport. He finds out that the only way to do so is to divorce his ""wife"", but for that he needs to find a woman who has the name Karmeghakuzhali. He successfully manages to track down a woman with the name Karmeghakuzhali (Ritika Singh), who is a television journalist, and tries to convince her to act as his wife and ""divorce"" him. Initially she refuses, but she soon gives Gandhi the necessary documents to ""divorce"" her, feeling pity for him. However, since both husband and wife need to be present at court at the time of divorce, Gandhi convinces Aarthi (Pooja Devariya), an actress who works in Stray Factory, to act as Karmeghakuzhali at the court. But at the time of the divorce hearing, Aarthi disappears to the toilet, forcing a reluctant Karmeghakuzhali, who is present at the court, to take part in the divorce hearing. The subsequent events at the divorce hearing prove humiliating for Karmeghakuzhali and she leaves the court in tears with no ""divorce"" granted.
Later, Gandhi finds out that Pandi was deported upon arrival in London by immigration officials for giving false information and address verification while obtaining his passport, and he too finds himself in the dock for doing the same. However, he shows his and Pandi's original Voter ID cards to the immigration officials, getting them released, while the middlemen are arrested. Pandi reveals that he was sent to Sri Lanka and tortured by prison officials after he had tried to seek asylum in London as a Sri Lankan refugee, and humiliated by the recent events, he returns to his village.
Gandhi goes to the Regional Passport Office in Chennai and admits his crime to the Regional Passport Officer. The passport officer asks him to pay a fine of ₹1,300 (equivalent to ₹1,300 or US$20 in 2017) to get Karmeghakuzhali's name removed from his passport. But in a last-minute decision, Gandhi chooses not to remove Karmeghakuzhali's name from his passport and instead proposes marriage to Karmeghakuzhali, who is initially taken aback, but agrees.

Shiva is a youth from Kumbakonam who unites lovers and his family support him. This brings him several troubles, one of which from David when Shiva stops David's marriage with a girl who refused to marry him. David wants to know who stopped his marriage and leaves the place without a word after seeing him. This worries his father, Ratnam as he fears that David might harm his son.

Shiva's sister is getting married and Shiva ensures that no trouble comes in the marriage. However, on the day before marriage, Shiva had to face a critical situation through David who threatens to stop his sister's marriage like how Shiva stopped his marriage. Shiva begs David and tells him that he is ready to do anything for him in return of letting his sister's marriage happen without any problem. David demands him to abduct a woman from Madurai, who is the daughter of Minister Manivasagam, an influential politician Madurai. Shiva agrees and leaves for Madurai missing his sister's wedding.
At Madurai, he finds Bharati, the fiancée of Cheliyan, who David want him to abduct. Shiva intends to take a selfie with her and make David believe that he abducted her but things turn in an unexpected way when Bharati announces everyone including her family that she is going to elope with Shiva, getting everyone to think he is her boyfriend. Manivasagam's men try to stop them, but they fly away to Coimbatore, the headquarters of Cheliyan. Shiva ensures that his sister's marriage happens without any problems and gets updates from his friend, Keerai. At Combaitore, Bharati waits for Shiva to propose her but Shiva is confused about why she eloped with him. David reaches Coimbatore and challenges Cheliyan that he abducted Bharati. Cheliyan rushes to the mall he owns where Shiva and Bharathi are having coffee time. Bharati encourages him to propose her, but in turn, Shiva tells about his childhood love.
Shiva during his 6th standard was in love with a girl named Mala, his tuition teacher who is very much elder to him. All the men in the town fall in love with her including a newly graduated doctor, Selvam. Mala reciprocates his love as well though they don’t declare their love to each other.

Mala's father cheats people with fraud chit funds and demands Mala to vacate the town failing on which he threatens her that he will commit suicide. Mala writes a letter to Selvam and asks Shiva to deliver it to him. However, on the way, Shiva's friends tempt him to watch a movie. The next morning, Selvam is shocked to know that Mala left the town without leaving any message. People who were deceived by Mala's father demand money from Selvam and they thrash Selvam's father leading to his death. Selvam turns insane out of shock. Shiva understands that the letter which he failed to deliver to Selvam is the reason behind his insanity. He is not able to recover from guilt and that is why he hallucinates Mala. To overcome his guilt, he starts to help lovers to get united. Bharati also reveals why she eloped with Shiva.
Bharati met Shiva during an 80th birthday marriage event of an elderly couple which was organised by Shiva. She was attracted by the fact that his family is supporting him for his acts and every one of them talks very good about him.

Remo,"Siva aka S.K (Sivakarthikeyan) is a theatre actor whose only aim is to become a superstar like Rajinikanth. However, his lack of acting out romantic scenes hinders his path to the dream, and is even rejected by director K. S. Ravikumar during the audition for his new film Avvai Shanmugi 2. He comes across Kavya (Keerthy Suresh), who is a doctor, and instantly falls in love with her. He goes to her house to propose his love, only to find out that she is engaged to a Pune-based doctor Vishwanathan alias Vishwa (Anson Paul). Siva, though distraught, decides to woo Kavya anyway and somehow break her engagement with Vishwa. He disguises himself as a nurse, going by the name of ""Remo"" (short for ""Regina Motwani"", a combination of the names of actresses Regina Cassandra and Hansika Motwani), and takes up a job in the same hospital where Kavya works.
Ensuring that Kavya never finds out his true identity, Siva as Remo establishes a close friendship with her, but is unable to convince her to end her engagement with Vishwa. Undeterred, he organises a massive surprise on her birthday and proposes to her as Siva. Kavya, who has been charmed by the surprise and fallen in love with Siva, is in a dilemma as she is unable to decide between Vishwa and Siva. Siva takes advantage of her dilemma and juggles the roles of both Siva as well as Remo with the aim of breaking her engagement, all the while hiding his dual identity from her. Eventually, Kavya gives in and admits her feelings to Siva, but, to the shock of both her and Siva, Vishwa has decided to prepone their marriage to the very next day. Kavya decides to end her engagement and leave her house to be with Siva. While Kavya pours out her feelings to Siva (who is disguised as Remo), Vishwa arrives with some goons to forcibly take her away. Siva, still in his Remo guise, thrashes Vishwa and his goons, but at the same moment, he is forced to rush to hospital to attend to a terminally-ill orphan Nancy (Baby Raksha), with whom he had established a close bond. On Nancy's cajoling (Siva as Remo has earlier promised her that he would ""change himself"" to a man as a ""magic trick""), Siva removes his Remo disguise, exposing his identity to Kavya. Betrayed and hurt, Kavya berates Siva for cheating her and ending her engagement and warns him never to go behind her again. Despite Siva's repeated pleas, Kavya refuses to budge and Siva sadly walks away.
A few months later, an old man sits next to Kavya in a bus. Kavya tells her latest problem to him: Siva is still attracted to her and constantly calls her, despite her having changed her number 46 times. However, she also adds that she still loves Siva and is only avoiding him as she wants to punish him for cheating her earlier. At this juncture, she accidentally finds out that the old man is none other than Siva in disguise. After scolding Siva for cheating her yet again, she softens and asks him to marry her the next day, to which he agrees.
The film ends with Siva finally achieving his dream: acting along with his best friend Vallikanth (Sathish) in a movie which seems to be his life story named Remo Nee Kadhalan (Remo Nee Styleki and Remo Ninda Premam in Telugu and Malayalam versions), directed by K. S. Ravikumar, in which actress Sri Divya plays the role of Kavya as Dr. Divya."
Kaashmora,"Kaashmora (Karthi) and his family live by cheating people in the name of black magic and dark spirits. One day, a PhD research student Yamini (Sri Divya) joins Kaashmora, only to gather evidence and expose him to the public. Kaashmora's fame brings him to a superstitious and fraudulent Minister (Sharath Lohitashwa). Kaashmora earns the Minister's trust. When income tax department raids the minister's house, he asks his henchmen to transfer all the illegal money to Kaashmora's house. Seeing this as an opportunity to escape and settle abroad, Kaashmora's family escapes with the money. Meanwhile, Chelapathy Rao, a Telugu man seeks Kaashmora's help and brings him to a haunted bungalow in Andhra Pradesh. In the bungalow, Kaashmora is haunted by real ghosts.
Back in Chennai, the Minister learns that Kaashmora is a fraud and sends his henchmen to kill his family. The henchmen try to get Kaashmora from the bungalow but are unable to do so as the ghost beats them all and drags Kaashmora and his family inside the bungalow. Inside, they meet with a broker who got trapped inside the bungalow for a long time. The broker says that the bungalow was once a princess's palace. Ever since her death, residents and owners of the bungalow had met with an ill-fated death. He also tells that there are 13 ghosts in the bungalow. The trapped people meet the ghost of Raj Nayak, the head of all the 13 ghosts. Rajnayak asks Kaashmora to help him and his 13 subordinates reach the spiritual world. He then locks them in the castle. That night, a young girl in Kaashmora's dream leads him to a locked door within the castle.
Waking up, Kaashmora follows the same route, but is stopped by Yamini, who reveals to him that Chelapathy Rao, the man who led him here, died 75 years ago and it was his ghost that led Kaashmora as well as Yamini to the bungalow. Kaashmora searches the castle and gets hold of an old book that dates back 700 years. Raj Nayak (Karthi) was a self-obsessed warlord and a womanizer. The King remained silent and didn't interfere with Rajnayak's growing atrocities because of his military prowess. One day, the princess Rathna Mahadevi (Nayanthara) elopes with her lover who is the enemy nation's prince. The King announces that he'll marry off Rathna and give away half of his kingdom to the man who finds her. Rajnayak kills the prince and forcibly brings Rathna back. He demands to be wedded to the princess, and wants the other half of the kingdom as dowry. When opposed, he kills the crown Prince and the King. He marries Rathna and coronates himself as the King. However, Rathna has other plans. She and her friends seduces Rajnayak and his subordinates. While his subordinates are burned alive, Rajnayak is beheaded by Rathna. However, he kills her before dying. Before breathing her last, Rathna places a curse on the 14 men, banishing them from reaching the spiritual world.
Ever since, Rajnayak and the other 13 ghosts had haunted the palace and its occupants. An exorcist once had predicted that Raj Nayak and the other ghosts would reach eternal power if they are able to sacrifice the lives of 5 people belonging to the same family with the same birth star (Rohini). The sacrifice should be performed by a lady who is the only woman in her generation. This should happen during the Navakaali Pournami that occurs once every 1000 years. Kaashmora recollects that his family members all have the same birth sign and that Yamini is the only woman in her family.
That night, Navakaali Pournami occurs and Rajnayak forces Kaashmora and his family to a guillotine. The young girl from Kaashmora's dream apparates and she turns out to be Rathna Mahadevi's reincarnation. While Rathna and Raj Nayak fight each other, Kaashmora fends off the subordinate ghosts with the help of a magical sword. Rathna's conscience leads him to a chamber within the castle where Rajnayak's remains are. Using the sword, Kaashmora destroys the remains, making Rajnayak vulnerable. Rathna destroys Raj Nayak's spirit and it goes to the underworld. The other spirits flee the castle to the spiritual world. Kaashmora and his family get out of the castle and he claims that he has destroyed the spirits and cleansed the centuries haunted bungalow. Kaashmora's family told the politician that the money stolen from the politician has been kept by the Ghost."

Maaveeran Kittu,"Set in the year 1987, the movie depicts the life of Krishnakumar alias Kittu (Vishnu), a Dalit youth whose main ambition is to become a collector. He is influenced by the ideas of Chinnarasu (R. Parthiepan), a local Dalit leader who had also sponsored his education. Chinnarasu and Kittu try to fight against the rampant caste discrimination meted out to them by the upper caste people, but are unable to do much about it as the police and courts are biased towards the upper castes. One day, Kittu sees his classmate Gomathi (Sri Divya), who is from the upper caste, discriminate against a Dalit girl. He admonishes her publicly for her act of caste discrimination, which makes her repent her behaviour. Gomathi eventually falls in love with Kittu, but Kittu maintains a distance as they are from different castes, though he too is in love with her.
When the news spreads through the village that Gomathi is in love with Kittu, upper caste men kill Gomathi's father and frame Kittu, who is imprisoned, but is soon released on bail as there is no evidence that he had killed Gomathi's father. Kittu then assaults the village inspector Selvaraj (Harish Uthaman), who holds a grudge against the Dalits and was responsible for framing him for the death of Gomathi's father. In retribution, Selvaraj arrests Kittu and thrashes him mercilessly in the police station. Kittu does not return home the next morning, despite Selvaraj's pleas that he had released him, prompting the villagers to think that Selvaraj had killed Kittu while in custody as his hatred towards the Dalits is well known in the village. The Dalits led by Chinnarasu protest outside the police station, leading to Selvaraj's suspension.
However, it is then revealed that Kittu had not gone ""missing"" but is living in a tribal village near Kodaikanal as part of a plan hatched by Kittu and Chinnarasu to expose the upper caste men involved in the death of Gomathi's father, with Kittu deciding to return to the village after he is cleared of all involvement in the murder. Gomathi, who is aware that Kittu had not killed her father, finds out Kittu's location and runs away from her home to be with him. At this juncture, the upper caste men and the police find out that Kittu is alive and in hiding and leave for Kodaikanal to capture Kittu and bring him back to the village with the intention to imprison Kittu, humiliate Chinnarasu and reclaim their domination over the Dalits. Kittu finds out about their plan and asks Gomathi to return to the village, promising to marry her once he is cleared of all charges.
Sadly, Kittu and Gomathi never reunite as Kittu had decided to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff in order to save the reputation to Chinnarasu and expose the upper caste discrimination against the Dalits. He is found dead by the police, which exposes the upper caste hatred towards the Dalits. The movie ends with the funeral procession of Kittu going through the main street of the village, which had traditionally been out of bounds for the Dalits to carry their dead, thus implying the end of caste discrimination in the village."

Kaththi Sandai,"Arjun Ramakrishnan (Vishal) comes to Chennai to woo a psychology student Divya (Tamannaah), on whom he has a crush. With the help of Deva (Soori), a local incompetent don, he succeeds in winning her heart. Divya's elder brother is Tamizhselvan (Jagapathi Babu), the honest and sincere DCP of Chennai. He approves the relationship between Arjun and his sister and soon their wedding is fixed. One day, Tamizhselvan is kidnapped by some goons in retaliation for his thwarting of a black money scam six months ago. Arjun rescues Tamizhselvan and takes him home, only to reveal that he is actually a CBI officer who had discovered ₹250 crore stashed in Tamizhselvan's house as black money. ₹300 crore had been seized during the black money raid, but it was publicly announced that only ₹50 crore had been seized. Arjun takes away all the money but does not arrest Tamizhselvan due to his public reputation, instead of telling him to personally surrender later that day.
However, Tamizhselvan soon finds out that Arjun is not a CBI officer from a terrorist, but is a criminal who had recently been released from prison. He pursues Arjun with the aim of getting back the money. During the chase, he opens fire on Arjun's SUV, causing Arjun to lose control and meet with an accident, losing consciousness. Arjun wakes up in a hospital, having lost his memory. Tamizhselvan keeps Arjun in custody in a house, where a psychiatrist Dr. Boothri (Vadivelu) is assigned to restore Arjun's memory so that he can reveal where he has kept the money.

At night, he sneaks out of the house and steals the black money of a Union Minister (Jayaprakash), converting it to white money with the help of a hawala trader. However, Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister soon find out that Arjun had not lost his memory and has stolen even more of the black money. Arjun, confronted by Tamizhselvan and the Union Minister, reveals his motive for stealing the black money.
Arjun is from Manimangalam, a remote village with no basic amenities like roads, water, high schools and even proper housing and sanitation facilities. When the building of the only primary school in the village collapsed, he confronted the local MLA Sivagnanam, who had falsely claimed to have developed the village, instead pocketing all the money which was to be used for developing Manimangalam. Sivagnanam rudely sent him away, defending his corruption and even declaring that he would never develop the village. Following this, Arjun approached the Union Minister, who also turned out to be corrupt like Sivagnanam. Arjun's friends confront Sivagnanam and his men, who kill them all. It is at this stage that Arjun had decided to get back all the black money acquired by Sivagnanam (which was the ₹300 crore recovered earlier in the film) and the Union Minister and use it to develop Manimangalam.
Arjun takes Tamizhselvan, the Union Minister and Divya to Manimangalam, which is now a very well developed village. He reveals that he had used the money hoarded by the Union Minister along with Sivagnanam's ₹300 crore to develop the village and had given the credit to him, because of which the villagers now hold the Union Minister in high regard. Tamizhselvan drops all charges against Arjun, seeing that he had stolen the money which was black for good intentions and arrests the Union Minister. In the credits, it is revealed that Divya and Tamizhselvan involve themselves in the development of Manimangalam along with Arjun."

Bairavaa,"Bhairava (Kala Bhairava in Telugu Version) (Vijay), a collection agent for ICCI Bank in Chennai (Vijayawada in Telugu Version), is a righteous person who is willing to employ even violent means to get back the money from the debtors. During his manager's daughter's wedding, he comes across Malarvizhi (Keerthy Suresh), a medical student from Kallidaikurichi in Tirunelveli district (Vishakhapatnam in Telugu Version), and immediately falls in love with her. Malarvizhi goes to the Koyambedu bus station to leave Chennai, where Bhairava comes to propose his love, when he notices that she is cornered by a group of thugs with intent to kill her, as she was allegedly involved in an attack on a Union Minister's son Charan (Roshan Basheer). However, they retreat after receiving a call from Periyakannu alias PK (Jagapathi Babu) from Tirunelveli, who tells them not to harm her.
When confronted by Bhairava, Malarvizhi narrates her flashback. She studies at PK Medical College in Tirunelveli, whose chairman is PK, a criminal and politician who rules Tirunelveli along with his right-hand man Kottai Veeran (Daniel Balaji). The college has no basic facilities, including a proper building and good doctors. Malarvizhi and her best friend Vaishali (Aparna Vinod) lodged a complaint against the college to the MCI, upon which they decided to blacklist the college. To save his reputation, PK made a deal with the MCI officials to revoke the suspension in exchange for sex with a girl from the college. Vaishali was the girl chosen by the officials. The next morning, she was found raped and killed. Malarvizhi's father (Aadukalam Naren), a sincere police officer, began an investigation in Vaishali's death, but he was killed as well by PK in retribution. Later, Malarvizhi filed a case against PK in the court, where the judge ruled that Malarvizhi should not be expelled nor harmed till the case is resolved. Though PK upholds the judge's ruling, he harasses Malarvizhi indirectly. He plans to kill her once the verdict is declared in his favour. During the marriage, Malarvizhi had given the video evidence of Vaishali being raped to Charan. As he is the son of a Union Minister, she believed he could pull strings in NIC, to investigate the video. Charan was also attacked by PK's henchmen when they chopped his hand and they took the evidence.
On hearing Malarvizhi's story, Bhairava decides to help her fight back with PK and get justice for Vaishali. Impersonating as an Income Tax officer, Bhairava raids PK's mansion and collects evidence which holds PK responsible for Vaishali's death. Soon, the Lion and Tiger game begins between Bhairava and PK. In the process, PK gets back the evidence and destroys them. Bhairava manages to get five more days from the court to gather the required evidence. Meanwhile, Kottai Veeran's wife, who was terminally ill, passes away. Bhairava decides to take advantage of Kottai Veeran's love for his wife to make him approver against PK. Hence the former switches PK's asthma inhaler with nitrous oxide. PK, who inadvertently inhales the gas before Kottai Veeran's wife's funeral, begins to uncontrollably laugh at the funeral, causing Kottai Veeran to turn against him and accept Bhairava's offer of becoming an approver, turning against PK. In revenge for betraying him, PK confronts Kottai Veeran and hacks him to death.
Hearing about Kottai Veeran's murder by PK, Bhairava frames the latter for plotting to assassinate the Prime Minister of India on his plan to visit the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, as a result of which a shoot at sight is ordered against PK. He then disguises himself as a NSG commando, blends in with the real NSG commandos and kills PK.
In the end, the verdict is declared in favour of Bhairava and Malarvizhi. PK's henchmen are arrested while the students of PK Medical College are shifted to another college. In a press conference, Bhairava, while supporting private colleges, says that it is important that the person heading such colleges are honest and sincere enough to ensure that the students are safe and receive a good education. Hence the movie ends on a happy note with Bhairava and Malarvizhi getting married, thus reunited with each other."

He lives with his family consisted of his parents, an elder sister, and a brother in law, while also leading a team of police officers with him, which those are Sathya (Varun), Akshara (Akshara Gowda) and Prasad (Nagendra Prasad). His family set up an arranged marriage for him with a girl named Mahalakshmi (Hansika).

While interrogating Aadhithya, Vikram's best friend Prasad is killed by Aadhithya, who switched his soul into Sathya. When Vikram gets high temper and goes to shoot Aadhithya, Aadhithya again switches his soul and now takes the role of Vikram and masks the killing of Vikram's best friend by saying that both Sathya and Prasad had personal vengeance.
After coming to Vikram's home, Aadhithya (in Vikram's body) comes across Vikram's fiancee. When Vikram (in Aditya's body) is surprised to find himself imprisoned, he explains to Sathya that he is not Adithya and escapes from the prison.
After escaping from the prison, Vikram calls the Chennai City Police Commissioner Rajkumar (Ponvannan) and tells the mishaps of events which occurred.

When Aadhithya tracks Chezhiyan, Vikram hides and talks to Chezhiyan who says that Aadhithya's power is only in his body (in which Vikram is) and in other bodies, his power doesn't work, so Vikram uses Chezhiyan to take the manuscript from the commissioner's office. Aadhithya tracks Chezhiyan's phone, finds him and kills him.
Vikram (in Aadhithya's body) goes there and puts a bomb on himself so that Aadhithya may get scared that if his body goes away, he won't be able to use his powers. Hence Vikram and Aadhithya switch over to their original bodies and now Aadhithya pleads Vikram to diffuse his bomb. But Vikram, who had double-crossed Aadhithya, knocks him out and while taking him to arrest, Aadhithya switches his soul to Vikram's father Arumugam (Aadukalam Naren) and beats Vikram; after that Aadhithya switches to Maha's body and stabs him and threatens to kill Mahalakshmi if he does not remove his bomb, and so Vikram defuses the bomb.

Vikram chases them and ends up in a coast. Vikram gains the upperhand and knocks Aadhithya, and returns with Maha to home.

Thendral's family move out of the city's outskirts and unknowingly into the apartment right opposite Vetri's home. Only then does Vetri realize that her family is finding a groom for her and people will start questioning her morals if the police keeps on visiting her. Eventually, Thendral reveals that she saw two cars that day outside the church; one belonging to Jessica, and another black minivan driven by a group of mysterious young men.
Thendral is attacked by a group of thugs driving a similar minivan. She is saved by Vetri. After this incident, Vetri and Thendral start dating and fall in love. At around the same time, Jessica's body is found at a landfill site and it is revealed that she was pregnant at the time of her murder. Her husband, the director of a leading TV channel, simply claims that they have only recently tried to conceive.
Vetri's investigation soon leads them to a petrol station close to the church. The security cameras captured the men in the black minivan. At the same time, Thendral notices that the men are outside her apartment. She phones Vetri, who instructs her to shut all the doors and stay indoors. When Vetri shows up, the men have gone. When he goes home, he finds that his sister-in-law has hanged herself to death. The police concludes that Abhinaya committed suicide since there was no sign of intrusion. At her funeral, Abhinaya's mother reveals that she had asked her father for five million rupees a few days before. Thendral reveals that one of her doctor friends treated Aravind and Abhinaya and that Aravind is infertile, leading Thendral to theorize that Abhinaya might have been unfaithful.
While looking through his sister-in-law's postmortem report, Vetri realizes that her body contained traces of Clomiphene similar to Jessica's body. After talking to the coroner, Vetri learns there is a third young woman who matches this pattern. Realizing that Aravind might be hiding something, Vetri confronts his brother, when he and his wife had opted for an artificial insemination using his own sperm. Vetri then visits Dr. Tulsi at her hospital and sees on enquiry, he realizes that she is hiding something. He requests for all the files on patients who have underwent artificial insemination at the hospital. He also notices that Kousalya(Neelima Rani), a famous TV artist gets treated successfully in that hospital. While studying the files, Vetri realizes the documents on artificial insemination patients had an unusual watermark with the number 23 on them.
The following day, Vetri visits Kousalya and her husband to question them on whether they have been blackmailed recently. Although the couple deny everything, Vetri asks his team to tap their phones, especially income calls. True enough, Kousalya receives a call instructing her to pay a huge sum of money in exchange for not revealing information that might destroy her career. Vetri and his team shadow the young couple the next day. Kousalya and her husband are seen withdrawing money from a bank and driving through a busy street. Just then, a young man covering his face forcefully enters their car and takes the money. By the time Vetri catches up with them, the man has escaped. However, Vetri's men had placed a tracker on the bag containing the money.
Vetri easily tracks the man to his apartment and manages to overpower the criminal to interrogate him. He reveals that he is Gaurav (Aravind Akash) and is part of a gang that has been blackmailing several women in the city who have legally undergone artificial insemination at Dr. Tulsi's hospital. One of their first victims was Jessica, who is an ardent cricket fan. She had hired Gaurav's gang to get hold of her favourite cricket player's sperm in order to conceive his child. However, she soon felt guilty. Feeling that they might get caught, Gaurav killed her and the priest who heard her confession. Next was the politician's daughter-in-law who slit her own wrists at her baby shower. Her husband was infertile and her father-in-law arranged for her to be inseminated with his own sperm.
Finally, there was Abhinaya, who learned from Gaurav's partner, John (Vamsi Krishna) that Dr. Tulsi lied about using Aravind's sperm and instead inseminated her with someone else's sperm. John then blackmails Abhinaya for the fifty lakh rupees, or else he will expose the truth and bring shame upon her family. Abhinaya finally goes back to Dr. Tulsi to get an abortion. When Gaurav's gang learns about this, they came to Vetri's house that day when Thendral saw them and killed Abhinaya. They then arranged for it to look like a suicide. Once Gaurav was done confessing, Vetri kills him in a fit of anger.
As Vetri and his men head over to the hospital to arrest Dr. Tulsi, he suddenly remembers how a few years ago, a man named John reported his wife had gone missing. John was upset that his wife did not want to bear his children and instead wanted an artificial insemination with a much more superior male. A few days later, she was found dead. Since then, John had gone missing. Vetri had one of his men look into John's disappearance. Meanwhile, the same John is shown to be working as a lab assistant at Dr. Tulsi's sperm bank. He was the one who has been manipulating the donor's records and passing on the information to Gaurav. When Dr. Tulsi and her husband threaten to have him exposed, he swiftly kills them and leaves. On his way out, he bumps into Vetri.
Later that night, Vetri gets a call from John who has abducted Thendral. Vetri manages to track John down and saves Thendral. However, John is a trained fighter and beats up Vetri. John reveals that he arranged for Abhinaya to be inseminated with his own sperm. When he learned that she was planning an abortion, he could not accept it and had Gaurav kill her. While John is ranting, Vetri manages to overpowers him, and killing him. The film ends with Vetri and Thendral discussing about the misuse of medical advancements in people and the importance of adopting orphans."

The constable takes out Sri for a tea break , where Sri identifies one of Sundeep's friends, who was involved in the attack. Sri nabs him and hands him over to the police. He then reports to Regina and tells her that he doesn't want this job as he doesn't like the city. He also tells her that he lost his certificates and will get eventually fired if he doesn't produce them. Regina gives him a one day time to find the certificates and return to his job. Sundeep is also in the office at that time and he intervenes Regina and Sri, while shouting at Sri. Regina asks him to keep quiet, which becomes a quarrel. The police come to the office and arrest Sundeep for the acid attack case. The Inspector is revealed to be Sundeep's uncle and he warns them off by leaving them with a condition that none of them should enter Chennai for a month. Sundeep decides to take revenge on Sri by stealing his certificates from the station, but doesn't do so. He still is angry with him and prepares to leave the city.
The rowdies who attacked Sri first, are planning to kidnap a school kid and demand a ransom from his father. They hire Winnings, one of the rowdies' friend from Pondicherry, who claims himself to be an expert kidnapper. But, he is a fool and is a coward. He mistakenly kidnaps the son of PKP. PKP's men start the search and kill everyone, whom they have doubts on. Winnings calls PKP and demands one crore. PKP sets out with the cash to save his son. The kidnappers know that PKP will definitely find them and they cannot escape PKP's wrath. So they decide to kill PKP's son anyway. But, PKP's son escapes. One of the rowdies begin searching and the remaining two decide to lure PKP into a trap and somehow get the money.
Sundeep is ready to leave the city, but wants to meet Regina and apologize to her. He comes outside her home and she finally agrees to meet him. She reciprocates his feelings and suddenly, she sees PKP's son jumping down from a small truck in which he was hiding. Since he was sedated, he seems drowsy. So, Regina asks Sundeep to drop PKP's son to safety. At that time, one of the rowdies, who is searching for PKP's son, finds them and he tries to take him forcefully. Sundeep attacks him and saves PKP's son. He tells Regina to go home and he sets out with PKP's son to return him to PKP. Meantime, PKP is infuriated, due to repeated calls from the kidnappers and they make him wander from one place to another, without any result. Sundeep calls PKP to tell him that he has his son. But, PKP believes him to be one of the kidnappers playing his games. So, he warns him and hangs up the phone. Sundeep decides to drop PKP's son at his home.
Sri leaves his office and gets ready to go home. He is driven home by Charle. As he is new to the city, he doesn't know the route to Sri's place and neither does Sri. Since it is a night shift, they find it difficult to find the correct route. Sundeep's uncle gets news about the kidnapping of PKP's son, sets up barricade near PKP's home and he sees Sundeep coming with PKP' son. Sundeep hands over PKP's son to his uncle and the constable, while leaving the scene, as his uncle scold him for not leaving the city yet. The police also have Winnings in custody in the jeep, who is apprehended for causing nuisance. Winnings identifies the boy and reveals everything to Sundeep's uncle. Sundeep's uncle decides to play his own game. So, he sends the writer away to buy some things for him, sets up Winnings as the kidnapper, tells him to call PKP, and make him come to the location. So, that he can kill everyone and take the money all by himself.
Sri and Charle roam around the city unable to find the route, while Sri tells him that he doesn't like the city saying that people here are too mean and never help anyone. Charle tells him that one should start helping others first, before expecting help from them. They run into the two rowides who wait for PKP, but are suddenly attacked by them, after they see PKP's sticker on the car and ended up thinking that they have come to spy on them. Sri then identifies one of the rowdies to be his attacker, who attacked him outside the bar first and Sri fights him back. He gains control and gets back his phone. Meanwhile PKP's men trace Sri, as his phone was also used by the rowdies to make the call to PKP. Sri then saves Charle, who is injured by the rowdies and asks for help from the on-goers, but no one stops to help.
PKP arrive at the place, where Winnings told him to come and sees Winnings pointing a gun at his son's head. Sundeep's uncle hides in a building and instructs Winnings on how to get the money. Suddenly, Sundeep comes back to the place and witnessing the entire scene in which a chaos occurs. During the tussle with the gun, Sundeep's uncle and Winnings shoots PKP and his son throws PKP's gun towards Sundeep, who shoots his uncle on one of his legs to save both PKP and his son. The constable now returns and lets Sundeep escape the scene, while informing the police that someone had shot Sundeep's uncle. Sundeep, the injured PKP, his son, and Winnings flee the scene. PKP decides to give the one crore to Winnings, who eventually drove PKP and his son to safety at a hospital. Bu, Winnings refuses to take the money and walks away. Sundeep decides to stay in the city and tells to himself that if criminals like his uncle can stay in the city, then why not him?
He then passes by Sri, who is demanding for a lift to save Charle. Seeing Sundeep, he stops asking, knowing that Sundeep won't help him, due to their earlier encounters. But, Sundeep gives them a lift and takes them to a hospital, saving Charle's life. Sundeep and Sri wait outside the hospital and begin to talk by asking their names. When suddenly, a few men appear and plan to attack Sundeep. They were the friends of the man on whom Sundeep attacked with acid. They come to get their revenge on Sundeep. Sri sees this and remembers what Charle told him about helping others. The film ends with Sundeep getting ready to attack and Sri joining him, symbolizing that they have overcome their differences and begin to help each other during tough times, even if they don't know each other's names, just like how the rest of the people in the city live by helping strangers."

Kavan,"Thilak (Vijay Sethupathi) is a news anchor who works for Zen One TV, which is run by Kalyan (Akashdeep Saighal), a corrupt and unethical media baron who uses blatant sensationalism to gain TRP and is closely associated with Dheeran Maniarasu (Bose Venkat), a corrupt and powerful politician. Kalyan ensures that his channel does not report anything negatively about Dheeran and receives kickbacks in return. Also working for Zen One TV is Malar (Madonna Sebastian), who is Thilak's ex-girlfriend. Though Malar avoids Thilak initially, she soon realises her feelings for him and they get back together.
One day, Malar gets the news that her friend Kalpana (Darshana Rajendran), who is a social activist, has been raped with the blame put on her boyfriend Abdul (Vikranth). Thilak, Creative Head Ashok (Five Star Krishna) and Malar manage to smuggle out Kalpana from hospital and convince her to tell her story. Kalpana had been raped by Dheeran's goons in retribution for protesting against Dheeran's pesticide factory, which had ruined a once-prosperous village due to the effluents coming out of the factory, and the blame was put on Abdul instead. This confession is telecasted live and Kalpana gains massive support from the public. However, Kalyan soon telecasts another video which depicts Kalpana as ""mentally ill"" and had tried to malign Dheeran due to her ""mental state"". Enraged, Thilak attempts to expose Dheeran during a talk show, despite being bound by the Zen One management to ask questions framed by them to Dheeran. A brawl eventually ensues between Thilak and Dheeran and Thilak even brutally assaults Ashok, who is responsible for the video which had defamed Kalpana. Thilak then confronts Kalyan for his cronyism and lack of journalism ethics and is fired and blacklisted from all major media networks in response. Malar, Executive Producer Jagan (Jagan) and two other colleagues also walk out with Thilak in a show of solidarity and they too are blacklisted.
With nowhere else to go, Thilak, Malar, Jagan and the other 2 colleagues take up jobs with Muthamizh TV, a struggling local news channel run by Mayilvaganan (T. Rajendar). Thilak goes to the village and reports on how the villagers are affected as a result of the pesticide factory and telecasts it on Muthamizh TV. He also makes Abdul and Kalpana reveal their side of the story and also gets that telecasted along with a video showing Dheeran assaulting him at the Zen One TV studio. With Zen One TV as well as Dheeran now exposed, Kalyan decides to take revenge on Thilak by orchestrating a bomb blast with the help of Dheeran at the District Collector's Office and putting the blame on Abdul, who was present at the Collector's Office minutes before the bomb exploded, thereby sensationalising it as a ""terrorist attack"". He also frames Thilak, Malar and Muthamizh TV as co-conspirators, leading to Muthamizh TV being blacked out by the Central Government. Undaunted, Thilak, who is on the run, manages to capture a video of Abdul revealing that he was not involved in any terrorist attack and was framed by Dheeran and Zen One TV. Thilak also records a video showing Ashok and the police orchestrating a fake encounter to kill Abdul. He manages to get both the videos telecasted on Zen One TV itself with the help of Jagan and the other 2 colleagues (who have rejoined Zen One TV as part of Thilak's plan to expose Kalyan and Dheeran) as well as his former boss Pillai (Pandiarajan), the Chief Editor at Zen One TV who had long suffered in silence against the atrocities committed by the Zen One management.
Having being exposed completely, Kalyan and Dheeran, who are at the Muthamizh TV studio, boldly admit their crimes to Thilak and defend themselves, but unfortunately for them, their confession is recorded by the Police Commissioner (Nassar), who was working incognito in Muthamizh TV. Kalyan and Dheeran are arrested. Thilak, Mayilvaganan, Malar, Jagan, Pillai and the other 2 colleagues celebrate their victory."

Meanwhile, Murthy follows Gunasekaran to a bank and attempts another robbery and kills him, after which he throws the money on the street. When Murthy returns home he finds out that the police have surrounded him. Pandian takes Murthy's grandson hostage and there is a confrontation in which Sathya walks out with his gun . He later tells the investigation board that Murthy shot Pandian dead and Sathya had killed Murthy in self-defense. Sathya is given his job back.
As Sathya drives with Meera, she tells him that he should not feel bad for Murthy, as he was a bad person. And we are shown what actually happens in that room. Pandian with his gun on Murthy's grandsons head slips, and a shot is fired. Murthy in shock, shoots and kills Pandian, but it turns out that Pandian missed and did not hit Murthy's grandson. Sathya grabs Murthy and fights him, but cannot hurt him as he feels sorry for him. Murthy stands up and grabs the gun and tells Sathya to shoot him. He then explains that he did not tell his family about his cancer because he heard the family speaking why god didn't take him instead of his wife. He then says he robbed the bank for them and that he wanted to live his last days as a king. Murthy also says he did not mean to shoot the child and breaks down. Murthy grabs Sathya's hands, puts the gun to his forehead and says he doesn't want to put the family in shame by going to prison then shoots himself dead with the last bullet when Sathya hesitates.
After this flashback, at a stop light, Sathya sees the employer that framed him, on the side of the street, and the movie ends."

Shivalingesh suspects Sangeetha's father Krishnamoorthy (Radha Ravi) is responsible for Raheem's death as he disapproved Raheem & Sangeetha's love, only to find out that he has nothing to do with Raheem's death.
Sathya's behavior becomes erratic. She travels around the city in search of someone and she's redecorated the house with green curtains and lights, and she has cooked Biriyani, even though she has no experience in cooking. Pattukunjam and a few other maids inform Shivalingesh about Sathya's strange behavior. Shivalingesh meets his friend and psychiatrist, Ashok who advises Shivalingesh to observe her behavior secretly. That night, Shivalingesh returns home early. He hears a man's voice and smells a cigar burning. He heads to Sathya's room and is shocked to discover that Raheem's soul has possessed Sathya's body. Raheem warns Shivalingesh, that he must solve Raheem's murder.
Shivalingesh accesses the security footage at the railway station and discovers that a person, who was acting as a blind man is the killer. Shivalingesh tracks down the killer and chases him, finally cornering him on a train coach with no passengers. Sathya, who is still possessed by Raheem, enters and demands to know why the man killed him. The man tries to escape by jumping out of the moving train, but falls to his death. Shivalingesh takes Sathya to a Darga, informing only Sathya's mother Sarala (Bhanupriya) about what has been happening. Baba (Pradeep Rawat) helps them to exorcise Raheem's soul out, but only temporarily. He tells Shivalingesh that solving Raheem's case is the only solution for saving Sathya.
Shivalingesh starts the investigation piece by piece, and Raheem's pigeon Saara helps Shivalingesh by giving clues. Shivalingesh interrogates Sathya at the CID Conference Hall about Raheem. It is then revealed that Raheem recovered Sathya's stolen iPad and returned it to her. Raheem refuses to even tell his name, so Sathya clicks a picture of him for the sake of his noble gesture. Sathya's stalker college mate sees this and feels jealous. So he makes a call to Sathya's residential landline and when her father Viswanathan (Jayaprakash) answers, he purposefully plants wrong information that Sathya and Raheem are planning to elope and marry. Hearing this, Viswanathan hires David, an assasin to injure and cripple Raheem.
After unveiling the truth about the mistaken identity, the ghost of Raheem possesses Sathya and threatens everyone present in the hall. Sathya's father begs for his forgiveness and tells that he intended to only harm Raheem, not to kill him. Shivalingesh also begs Raheem to leave Sathya's body and asks Raheem to possess him instead, promising to show the killer. Then, it is revealed that a pigeon race organizer (Zakir Hussain), came to know about David's assignment to injure Raheem and paid David more money to kill him, since Raheem and Saara are his arch nemesis in the pigeon race and the duo wins every single game. The organizer is insulted by his friends for his incapability. The possessed Shivalingesh kills all the henchmen, while allowing Raheem to exit his body and possess and kill the pigeon race organiser. In the end credits, Shivalingesh and a pregnant Sathya get reunited."

After vanquishing the Kalakeyas, Amarendra Baahubali is declared as the future king of Mahishmati and Bhallaladeva its commander-in-chief. The Rajamata Sivagami orders Amarendra to tour the kingdom and its neighbourhood, along with Kattappa. During the tour, Amarendra witnesses an attack by Devasena, the princess of Kuntala, a kingdom neighbouring Mahishmati.

Bhallaladeva receives message of Amarendra's act and upon viewing Devasena's portrait, lusts for her. He asks Sivagami for Devasena's hand in marriage. The Rajamata, who was unaware of Amarendra's feelings for Devasena, assures Bhallaladeva and sends an emissary to Kuntala, who delivers the marriage proposal in a patronising way. An insulted Devasena rejects the proposal with a scathing reply. Enraged hearing her response, Sivagami sends an order to Amarendra that Devasena be brought to Mahishmati as a captive.
Meanwhile, Kuntala is attacked by Pindaris, a dacoit-like army. Amarendra, with the help of Devasena's maternal cousin, Kumara Varma, is able to nullify the attack and save Kuntala. Upon being questioned, Amarendra reveals his true identity. He receives a bird post from Mahishmati, ordering him to take Devasena as captive. He promises Devasena that he will protect her honour and convinces her to come with him to Mahishmati as his future bride.
Upon reaching Mahishmati, the misunderstanding is brought to light and when an ultimatum is delivered to Amarendra that he must either choose the throne or Devasena, he chooses the latter. Bhallaladeva is crowned king and Amarendra is made the new commander-in-chief. During Devasena's baby shower, Bhallaladeva rids Amarendra of his duties as a ""gift"".

Kumara Varma enters the palace in the stealth of the night, only to be discovered by Bhallaladeva and be killed, but not before revealing their plot to convince Sivagami to kill Amarendra. Sivagami, convinced that Bhallaladeva's life is under threat but that open hostility would result in civil war, orders Kattappa to assassinate Amarendra. Kattappa, bound by his word to serve the Queen, lures Amarendra by feigning he is in trouble, and then stabs him in the back and kills him.
After Amarendra's death, Kattappa soon learns of Bhallaladeva's treachery and informs Sivagami, who reveals to the panicked hordes outside her palace that Amarendra is dead and that the baby Mahendra Baahubali has ascended the throne. As Bhallaladeva and his men are about to seize the queen, she flees with the new King but falls into a river after being hit by an arrow shot by Bhallaladeva. As Bhallaladeva holds Devasena prisoner for the next 25 years and destroys Kuntala, Mahendra grows up and leads the rebel group that has indulged in guerrilla warfare against King Bhallaladeva.
After listening to the whole story, Mahendra Baahubali (alias Sivudu) decides to avenge his father's death by raising his own army with the help of Kattappa and returns to Mahishmati along with Avantika and the people of the city. After an ensuing battle, Bhallaladeva is defeated by Mahendra and burnt alive on a pyre prepared by Devasena. Ending the cruel regime of Bhallaladeva, Mahendra becomes the new King with Avantika as his queen, bringing peace and harmony to Mahishmati."

Vikram Vedha,"The story begins with an animated interpretation based on the classical Indian mythology of King Vikramadithyan and Vedhalam. The influences from this traditional mythology correlates with the story of a police inspector, Vikram (R. Madhavan), (who is brave, honest and draconian about right and wrong) and a dreaded crime lord, Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi), (who is wise and seems to understand the grey shades between good and bad) in the present era. Vikram and his colleague Simon (Prem) are part of an 'encounter' unit led by the latter, formed to eliminate the dreaded crime lord, Vedha (Vijay Sethupathi). On one such encounter, the squad kills a few gangsters, framing the death of an unarmed criminal to avoid further inquiry. When a new recruit, Santhanam (Manikandan) is nervous about this, Vikram calms him by saying that he sleeps peacefully at night despite the encounters because he knows that the men he shoots are criminals, and not innocent. The unit makes plans for another raid when, Vedha walks into the police station and surrenders.
Vedha is totally impervious to intimidation and does not acknowledge the police officers until Vikram walks into the interrogation room. Vedha cheekily offers to tell him a story but Vikram, who believes that all evil must be severely punished, shows no interest. Vedha asks Vikram to only listen and then adjudge what is evil and what is not.
Vedha's first story is about how he, a henchman in a cocaine smuggling gang, endeared himself to the boss, Cheta (Hareesh Peradi), and eventually rose to become a gangster and smuggler himself. Vedha actively dissuades his intelligent brother, Pulli, to stay away from crime. However, he is forced by a rival gangster, Ravi (Vivek Prasanna) to carry drugs. When Pulli is caught by the police; he confesses and Ravi is arrested. Under his boss's orders, Ravi assaults Pulli, which leaves a permanent mark in his hand. Vedha asks Vikram if Vedha should kill Ravi who committed the act or his boss who gave the order. Vikram replies that Ravi was merely an instrument; the boss was the real culprit. Vedha replies that he did kill the boss. At this point Vedha's lawyer intervenes and Vedha is bailed out. Vikram is stunned to find out that Vedha is represented by his wife, Priya (Shraddha Srinath).
Vikram realises that unarmed person shot in the last encounter was Pulli, based on a scar in his hand. Vikram assumes Vedha might try to kill Simon, as Simon is instigator of the encounter. Vikram rushes to save Simon only to find him shot and killed by Chandra (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar), Pulli's girlfriend, who has also been killed. The Superintendent of Police (Achyuth Kumar), head of the encounter unit, puts it down as a botched encounter and closes the case. Priya refuses to divulge Vedha's whereabouts to Vikram, which tests their marriage. Shocked and angry, Vikram raids Vedha's tenements, captures him and brings him into the woods to shoot him, when Vedha pleads with Vikram to listen to another story, as his last wish, which may reveal something about Simon's death.
The second story starts with Pulli, now grown up, offering to launder Vedha's ill-gotten income by investing it in shares. Vedha's boss, Cheta invests five million rupees into this venture. One day Chandra is supposedly kidnapped and the money is missing. Chandra later returns and reveals that she had stolen the money to start a new life, away from the tenements and crime, but her love for Pulli brought her back to him. Vedha returns the money to Cheta, but is ordered to kill Chandra for betraying Cheta in the first place. Vedha now asks Vikram if he should respect his boss and carry out the order or if he should follow his heart and disobey Cheta, an action that would escalate into an all-out gang war. Vikram replies that he should support Pulli as he is innocent and oppose Cheta, to which Vedha agrees. Vikram stumbles for a moment when he realizes that Pulli was innocent. In that moment, Vedha attacks Vikram and flees, after telling him to investigate Simon's and Pulli's deaths.
A troubled Vikram starts investigating Pulli's death. He recalls that Vedha opposed Cheta and managed to get Pulli and Chandra out of the city, and wonders why Pulli was present at the site of the encounter. He also notices that Chandra was tortured prior to her death. Vikram finally discovers that Ravi, once Vedha's underling, was behind the initial shootout which, to Ravi's advantage, would have decimated Vedha's stronghold. Vikram informs Vedha, who tracks Ravi down and brings him to an abandoned factory. Vikram arrives to find Ravi, beaten within an inch of his life. Vedha proceeds to tell Vikram the third and final story.
Vedha had sent Pulli and Chandra to Mumbai away from Cheta. Vedha begins to notice a surprising pattern: only his men are being systematically targeted and eliminated by the police. Vedha himself narrowly manages to escape when his friend sacrifices his life for him. Based on Ravi's confession, Vedha narrates that Simon was paid by Ravi to gun down his men. Vedha asks Vikram if Simon was in the right; since he became corrupt to get the money to pay for an expensive medical procedure for his young son, and Vedha's men were gangsters who deserved to die anyway. Vedha then kills Ravi and escapes before Vikram can answer.
The encounter unit arrives and castigates Vikram for letting Vedha escape again. Vikram slowly pieces everything together. The entire unit had come into sudden money which could only be traced back to Ravi. The SP reveals that Ravi had paid them to kill Vedha and Chandra's abduction was intended to get Pulli from Mumbai, which would then lure Vedha out of hiding. The guilt-ridden Simon had arrived early that night to save Chandra, not to kill her, but they were both killed, and their deaths covered up. At this point when the unit prepares to kill Vikram, Vedha appears again and saves him. A gunfight ensues, where Vikram shoots and disables his colleagues, who were mere instruments but kills the SP, the instigator. Vedha, who had acquired a firearm turns on Vikram to find Vikram has a gun on him. Vikram asks Vedha if he should let Vedha go for saving his life or kill him since he is a criminal. The film ends with the standoff between the two men."

Nibunan,"Ranjith Kalidoss (Arjun) is a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in CB-CID, who along with his partners Inspector Joseph (Prasanna) and Inspector Vandana (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar) takes on high profile cases. Counter to his high intensity job, Ranjith has a peaceful family life with a wife, Shruti, a daughter, a younger brother, Sandeep and their family dog.
Ranjith's boss assigns his team a task to pursue a group of five criminals, who continue to avoid justice with their influence and power. Ranjith suggests a more direct approach to taking them out, but his boss declines to go along.
Before they could pursue the current assignment, they get dragged into another mystery. A parcel arrives at the police station one day that contains a small horse doll hanging on a noose. The figure has 4 holes but otherwise no other clues. Not thinking much of it, the team decides to ignore. A few days later, a local communist leader goes missing. He is later found in warehouse hanging from the ceiling, tortured, shot, and his face covered in an animal mask, very much like the doll they received.
The killer continues to taunt the team, sending them clues as he kills more people, which includes a lawyer and a doctor. Ranjith follows one of the clues and finds the killer. But before he could take him down, the tremors he has been experiencing lately slows him down. The killer knocks out Ranjith and gets away. When his team arrives, they inform him about a dead body in one of the buildings. But, Ranjith already knows and describes what he would find without seeing it.
Back at the office, Ranjith manages to piece things together and connects the serial killings to a case he investigated earlier. Emmanuel (Suman) and his wife (Suhasini) are a rich couple in town lived with their 16 year old daughter and a caretaker. The couple were very successful business people, but had very little time for their daughter. The caretaker took care of their daughter. One day, the couple came home to find their daughter murdered and the caretaker missing. The house had been ransacked. The police close the case concluding it was a burglary gone bad and the caretaker is on the run.
A local communist leader pushes to reopen the case, which lands with Ranjith. He quickly focuses the attention on Emmanuel. He sees a new golf club in his bag and his investigation leads to the missing golf club with the caretaker's blood on it. He interrogates Emmanuel and his wife with the evidence and they confess the truth. They came home one day to find the caretaker having sex with their daughter. Emmanuel, in anger hits him with the club and kills him. When their daughter threatens to call the police, her mom tries to stop her. In the scuffle, she accidentally falls on a sharp object and dies. Not able to wiggle their way out and driven by guilt, Emmanuel and his wife hang themselves.
Ranjith concludes the people that are killed were all involved in the case, and he himself is the next target. His boss takes over the case and tells Ranjith to get medical help for his condition. His team continues the investigate looking for a connection between Ranjith's case and the murders. There were no other family members that could be the murderer. Emmanuel has a nephew, Christopher (Krishna in Tamil and Karthik Jayaram in Kannada), but he lives in the US.
Ranjith gets admitted to the hospital, where as he continues to look at clues, he concludes it must be Christopher, as he has the motive, means and the know how. After checking with immigration services, they find Christopher did arrive in India not too long ago. A police officer went to Christopher's house to investigate and finds all the clues, but before he could alert his team, he is killed. Christopher baits Ranjith's team and captures Joseph and Vandana. Having no choice, Ranjith leaves the hospital to meet Christopher at a warehouse. There, he finds Joseph and Vandana standing on the floor with nooses around their necks.
After a long struggle, Ranjith manages to overpower Christopher and hangs him. The press arrives at the site, and Ranjith tells them Christopher is another victim of the serial killer.
A few days later, Joseph and Vandana meet Ranjith at his house and ask him why he didn't inform the press that Christopher was the serial killer. Ranjith then reveals his plan about their earlier assignment. He plans to kill the five criminals and blame it on the serial killer and also frame the last of them as the serial killer himself. During the closing end credits, it is shown that his plan worked."

However, her spiteful father angrily throws the bag from the top of the hospital balcony and into a trash bin below.
The film then flashes back to a few days ago in Thanjavur. One of Ekambaram's henchmen is seen buying this very bag from a shop and uses it for smuggling a golden idol worth 5 Crore from Thanjavur to Chennai. Ekambaram asks Sundaram to complete the task.

Sundaram goes to Sekar's house and he stays there, so that Sekar will complete the transaction and exchange the idol with a wealthy pawn shop owner and give the money back to Sundaram.
Back in the present, Sundaram reaches Chennai and goes to Sekar's house as per Ekambaram's instructions. However, unknown to anyone, Sekar is a manipulative characher with a more sinister idea. He plans to steal the money for himself. He contacts Ekambaram and tells him that Sundaram never arrived and he is yet to get the idol, implying that Sundaram ran away with it. Worried, Ekambaram comes to Chennai in search of his friend. Sekar, who still has Sundaram in his house, steals the old man's phone and gets rid of it.

Sundaram, believing Sekar is a good man, continues to stay in his house. Sekar then finds out that Ekambaram is on his way to Chennai. Knowing that he will be killed if Ekambaram finds out his plans, he decides to get rid of Sundaram.
After asking his wife and children to leave the city for a few days, he talks to Sundaram in a charming way and asks him if he can take care of the money or he needs someone to be sent with him.

Nevertheless, the henchman orders Kathir to get the bag back to him within an hour's time and meet them at Sekar's house. Ekambaram, now at Sekar's place, questions him.

She is the one who sent the videos of her dress change in the trial room at the clothing store and the naked bathing video. Kathir begs her not to take a hasty decision. Kathir explains that he has nothing to do with that action, but Meera blames him that Kathir reacted only when his loved ones faced a problem, but remained quiet when a third person got affected. She tells him that staying dumb when a crime is happening is equivalent to committing the crime. Kathir failed to stop his friends when DJ and Vinod violated the privacy of Mithula. Kathir begs for an apology, while confessing his own love and feelings to Meera. Meera tells him that she loves him a lot, but both of them have become a reason for Mithula's death and she cannot live with the guilt.

Neruppu Da,"Guru, Patta, Dhana, Parthi, and Seenu are five childhood friends, who live in the same area in from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Their main aim is to join in the Fire Service and save lives. So, till they get their jobs, they go around places dousing off fires and saving lives by themselves. Their actions are praised by the public and the concerned officials, including the Zonal Fire Officer, Narayanamoorthy, who promises them that they will get their jobs, if they write and pass the exam, that is needed for them to join the fire service soon.
On the night before the exam, Dhana meets his friends and he is seen to be injured. He tells them that while he was coming back home after seeing his sister, he was stopped by a man named Sadha and his friend and was slapped without any reason. Dhana tries to move on from there, but Sadha doesn't allow him and repeatedly assaults him. Sadha tells his friend that he is a don and he is unstoppable. So to prove his masculinity, he slapped Sadha. Dhana somehow manages to escape from there, after pushing Sadha away and escapes with his bike. Hearing this, the friends decide to teach Sadha a lesson and go to the place, where the incident happened. But to their shock, they see Sadha lying dead. It is then revealed that when Dhana pushed Sadha away, he fell down, hitting a rock and succumbing to his injury. It is also revealed that Sadha was the right hand of 'Puliyanthope' Ravi, the city's most feared don.
The five friends decide to seek help from Kabaali, the Counsellor of the area and a well wisher of Guru. Kabali tells them that Dhana have mistakenly killed Sadha and 'Puliyanthope' Ravi will definitely come to them to avenge his death. He tells them, that 'Puliyanthope' Ravi is too powerful for him and he cannot help them in this issue. And since, Sadha's friend was there on the scene, the five friends fear that 'Puliyanthope' Ravi will find them. So Guru suggests that, instead of living in fear, they should finish off 'Puliyanthope' Ravi, before he finds them. The five friends make a plan and decide to kidnap 'Puliyanthope' Ravi. They visit the burial place of Sadha, where 'Puliyanthope' Ravi and all the dons from Chennai had assembled. Guru mingles with the dons and instructs the others to hide in very particular places. Once 'Puliyanthope' Ravi gets away from the crowd, he will kidnap him. There, 'Puliyanthope' Ravi asks Sadha's friend, who was drinking when the incident happened, only for him to not remember anything, as he was too drunk. 'Puliyanthope' Ravi kills Sadha's friend in a fit of rage. Guru is relaxed and feels relieved, as the only evidence against them is Sadha's friend, who is now killed and feels that they are free from their troubles.
But, he gets a call from two of his friends, who were hiding in another place. They tell him that, they have kidnapped 'Puliyanthope' Ravi, as they were not aware of the things that happened in the burial site and have hidden him in their area. Guru is very upset and explains to his friends what happened, telling them that they are back in trouble. As they discuss what to do next, 'Puliyanthope' Ravi manages to escape, comes face to face with them, and asks for help. Apparently, 'Puliyanthope' Ravi doesn't remember who kidnapped him, as he met with an accident and became unconscious, which was when the friends kidnapped him. So, once again getting out of trouble, they release 'Puliyanthope' Ravi and live in peace.
'Puliyanthope' Ravi is keen on finding the man, who killed Sadha and kidnapped himself. Since, he was kidnapped and hidden in the area of the friends, he esquires there and catches Kabaali. Kabaali reveals the truth and the five friends are tracked down by 'Puliyanthope' Ravi. Guru manages to overcome and defeat 'Puliyanthope' Ravi and his henchmen in a fight, but spares him, even though he gets an opportunity to kill him. Guru apologizes to 'Puliyanthope' Ravi, by telli him that Sadha's death was an accident. But, 'Puliyanthope' Ravi is shown to have vengeance and a few days later, he confronts Guru and threatens to kill his loved ones.
Some days later, Guru's father, Manikkam is killed. Guru suspects that it was 'Puliyanthope' Ravi and decides to take revenge. But upon reaching Puliyanthope Ravi's place, he sees 'Puliyanthope' Ravi and his henchmen also being dead. The police revealed that, in fact, Puliyanthope Ravi was killed before Guru's father was killed. Guru is confused about who is the new killer. Guru gets a call saying that his friends and his girlfriend, Vasumathi, who is Narayanamoorthy's daughter have been kidnapped and if he wants to see them alive, he must come to a location. There, it is revealed that the person behind all of the murders is Annam, who is a transgender and also Sadha's wife. Annam has been trying to avenge his death. She approaches 'Puliyanthope' Ravi, but he refuses to help her by telling that Sadha's death was an accident and he won't kill Guru or his friends for this. Annam is angered by this and kills 'Puliyanthope' Ravi. She then kills Manikkam. She tells Guru that Sadha loved her so much, despite being a transgender and thinks he had shattered her life. So she decides to kill Vasumathi. But, Dhana escapes and manages to push Annam into the nearby pyre, which was burning, Guru manages to save Vasumathi. As, Annam is on fire, struggling, Guru jumps in and saves her. He tells her, that even if it is an enemy, he will not let someone get killed by fire. Guru apologizes to Annam, telling her that Sadha's death was an accident and left the place along with friends and Vasumathi. Annam gets moved by his gesture and forgives him.

Thupparivaalan,"The film starts with Dhiwakar, a software engineer (Vincent Asokan), his wife, his son, and his daughter, celebrating his birthday on the rooftop of his apartment. A sudden lightning strike kills him and his son. His wife (Simran), Mrs. Dhivakar and his daughter watch in horror, as they are burnt to death. At a movie theater, a man gropes a woman and a small commotion ensues, which was stopped by an ACP Paul Dhanarajan, who later dies in the middle of a police conference.The movie shifts to Detective Kaniyan Poongundran (Vishal), who lives with his friend and colleague, Manohar (Prasanna) is furious that he does not have a case worthy of his mettle. Later, Kaniyan and Manohar come across Mallika (Anu Emmanuel), who is forced into pick-pocketing by her uncle (Ravi Mariya), who is an alcoholic. Kaniyan intimidates her uncle, causing him to reform all of a sudden and offers her a job.
One day a small school boy, Naveen visits Kaniyan and Manohar with a case that his pet dog Nemo, a Pomeranian, was shot dead and asks him to find out the killer. He gives him the bullet collected from the dog's body. With his investigation and the help of a friend, who works in the sciences section of the police department and had asked Kaniyan's help on a previous case, he finds out that it is a 9mm bullet and had been ricocheted from the dog. At the crime scene, he finds a tooth, with which he collects information about it from a dental hospital and tracks its owner as Swarnavel (Ashvatt), who formerly was a physics professor in an university and had divorced his wife before two years, for he blamed her for the death of their son and is presently living alone and working as a stockbroker. Meanwhile, a man named Kamalesh (John Vijay) visits a travel agency to deliver a sofa stashed with money. He delivers it to a group of five members who run the travel agency, Devil (Vinay Rai), Muthu (Bhagyaraj), Pritha (Andrea Jeremiah), a stout man (Dheeraj Rathnam) and a bald-headed man (Siddhanth Venkatesh), who are all believed to be assassins.

She reveals that, a thunder occurred in the beginning, followed by lightning, which struck Dhivakar and their son. Kaniyan finds out that Swarnavel was present in a nearby construction site on the date of the incident. He concludes that it was an artificial lightning devised by Swarnavel to kill Dhivakar, as lightning travels faster than sound so the thunder could not have been heard first. When the assassins learn that Kaniyan is on their tail, Devil disposes of Swarnavel's body, who was killed earlier when he, ridden with guilt, proposed to surrender.
Later, Kaniyan and Manohar visits Dhivakar's office and learns that a tender, which was to be awarded to Dhivakar, is now with Ram Prasad (Jayaprakash), the chairman and head of the company Dhivakar competed with.

Before he could reach Kamalesh, Kamalesh is killed by Pritha, and made it look like heavy dossage of Viagra. A chase ensues between Kaniyan, Pritha and the bald-headed man. Surrounded by Kaniyan and the police force, the bald-headed man kills himself by performing seppuku while Pritha escapes amidst the commotion.

Aval,"The film opens with an ancient Chinese mother and daughter. They seem to spend happy moments with each other with the mother being pregnant. The movie then moves to the present where a happy couple Krishnakanth aka Krish (Siddharth) and Lakshmi (Andrea Jeremiah) make love, bringing in their memories of the times they met and how their love blossomed. They then notice that a new family is moving into the next house. Krish is a neurosurgeon who specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS) to cure Parkinson's. He is close to another doctor, Dr. Prasad, who is a psychiatrist.
The two families get along well, with Jennifer aka Jenny, who is the eldest daughter having a crush on Krish. Everything goes well when suddenly during a dinner party, Krish sees Jenny jumping into the nearby well. Informing the family, he jumps into the well and saves her. Lakshmi who is angry at Krish for impulsively jumping into the deep well, quarrels with him that night before Krish forcefully kisses her and both end up having sex. That night, Jenny has seizures and once again, Krish helps her in time. During another dinner at Krish's house, Jenny panics after seeing a strange figure and her parents forcefully take her home. The people in the house start noticing strange things. The next morning, Jenny, once again not being self-aware, goes towards a cliff to jump. Sarah, who follows her, slips towards another cliff, but is saved by Krish.
When Paul goes towards Jenny to stop her, she herself returns home without saying anything, while still in a trance & passes out in the house. Her father then takes her to the psychiatrist on Krish's recommendation and she reveals two specific things that she thought was abnormal: a voice speaking to her in Chinese and another terrifying incident in the toilet. The psychiatrist feels that something is wrong and visits Jenny's room one day with the permission of her father who takes her out. He tries to decipher her mental state by reading the condition of her room, while also finding recent internet searches about ghosts in her tablet, and a book about exorcism lying in her drawer. Upon seeing this, he concludes that Jenny must've made up an image in her mind that she's possessed by a spirit. So, he, Krish, and Jenny's dad plan to administer fake exorcism with the help of a church pastor, Father Joshua in order to bind the spirit. All hell breaks loose in doing so, revealing that she is really possessed by a powerful spirit of the Chinese mother, resulting in Father Joshua getting injured and admitted to the hospital in a comatose state.
Jenny returns to a normal state, but to confirm what is going on, her grandfather calls on a psychic. But Jenny's father dismisses him. One night, the servant in the house prepares a voodoo doll to chase the bad spirit, but is scolded by Paul not to do occult in house. The same night, she is hit by the ghost in the same way as the voodoo doll, while being wrapped by her own shawl, impaled on the head by a nail. The next morning, when Paul looks around her room, he finds the Voodoo doll under the bed and what appears to be fingernail marks below the bed frame. Evidently spooked, he tells his father to call the psychic. Using his power, the psychic talks to the spirit, who signals to him that there are not two, but three spirits in the house, with the third one being revealed to actually be a malevolent force which would not let them leave the house.
Lakshmi announces that she is pregnant, but within a few days, she falls off a ladder, while seeing a scary figure on the water tank, who was actually attempting to cause her a miscarriage, but the child survives. Krish gets suspended as he was constantly distracted by these figures, while in the operation theater causing a hemorrhage to the patient being operated. Dr. Prasad, with the help of a local police inspector, starts researching about a family that used to live in that house finding out that there was an eye witness who knew what happened to the family. Simultaneously, the psychic too, using the comb which belonged to the Chinese daughter, begins to place the pieces of the mystery. When Dr. Prasad and Krish go to see the witness in a village, she tells a flashback when she was eight years old. It is revealed that the house belonged to a rich Chinese silk merchant who lived with his wife and daughter. He wished that his pregnant wife should bear a male child. As he was a Satan worshiper, he had to sacrifice a girl child during the time of the solar eclipse to get a male child.
To achieve this purpose, he kidnapped the then eight year old witness when she was collecting flowers in the garden nearby as usual. The eight year old was saved in time by his wife, which left him with no option, but to sacrifice his own daughter. He hit his wife, until she fell unconscious. Luring his daughter, he beheaded her using a sacrificial sword. His wife, regaining her consciousness, couldn't bear the sight of her dead daughter on the floor. Cursing her husband, she took a knife and pierced herself in the abdomen, killing herself and the unborn child, telling him that she does not need a male child by sacrificing a female child. The husband, realizing his loss, takes his own life by drowning in the nearby well.
Returning to the present, the father orders his family to pack up and leave the house. Lakshmi is being chased in the hospital by the two spirits only to guide her to Father Joshua’s room. Being the day of the solar eclipse, the old woman speculates that the Chinese merchant would return to complete his ritual. Lakshmi calls Krish and tells him that she is discharged and is headed to see Jenny. Krish too comes back from the village at the request of Lakshmi to stay with Jenny. Lakshmi then tricks Krish and locks him in Jenny's room for impeding him till the eclipse ends. She then reveals what Father Joshua had seen on the day of exorcism. Though Jenny was set free, some other force tried to stop the prayers of Father Joshua in the room. The force was from none other than Krish. When Krish had jumped into the well the other night to save Jenny, the Chinese merchant’s spirit possessed him. Meanwhile, the psychiatrist being in the same room as Krish also figures that the Chinese merchant and Krish have common dates of birth. Krish being possessed, kills the psychiatrist in a gruesome way and escapes through the window.
It was from Krish that the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter were trying to protect the family by frightening them to leave the house. As the eclipse begins, the spirit of the Chinese merchant takes full control of Krish and he begins searching for his target, which is revealed to be Sarah, to sacrifice and complete the ritual. Though he lures her and tries to kill her, the family members and the spirits of the Chinese mother and the Chinese daughter fight with Krish by trying to distract him, until the eclipse ends and they finally succeed in removing the spirit from his body.
In the end, Krish and Lakshmi are shown to be settled in Goa. Jenny, along with her dad comes to meet them. When Jenny requests to meet their son, it is revealed to the viewers that Krish, being possessed by the Chinese merchant’s spirit had sex with Lakshmi resulting in a baby actually born of the Chinese merchant instead, which the couple is unaware of. The film ends with the camera panning towards the boy seated in a room, slowly revealing his face & focusing on the iris of his eye, which splits into double iris and the screen cuts to black."

Just before the day of his marriage, he borrows his friend's car and promises to return it soon.
Kulandai Velu (Soori) is a dubbing artist, who dubs for Chhota Bheem in Chennai. His wife lives in his native place and is expecting a child very soon. Kulandai promises to return to her soon, after completing the day's work. He starts heading to his native place late that night on his motorbike. Chotta meets Kulandai on the highway and asks for a lift. He obliges and also borrows Rs.200 to fill petrol at a petrol bunk for the bike. As they travel, they arrive near a police check post, who look for traffic violators. Chotta sees this and escapes thinking that they are looking for him. Kulandai is perplexed. After sometime, while Chotta asks for a lift from Madhu but he mistakenly hits Chotta and injures him. Madhu admits Chotta in a hospital and escapes from there, as he did not have enough money to pay the bill. Chotta also manages to escape the hospital and reaches his hideout place, a flat in an apartment building, owned by one of his associates, a lady who works as a manager, thus causing no doubts to anyone.
Meanwhile, the doctor, who treated Chotta in the hospital comes to know from the news that Chotta is a wanted terrorist and informs the police. The police collect the CCTV footage from the hospital and the highway, which contained Madhu and Kulandai providing lifts to Chotta. Hence, they corner and arrest both of them. While being taken to custody, they are hit by a jeep and are injured, causing Kulandai to forget his past. Madhu thinks that Kulandai must be a real associate of Chotta and if he can make Kulandai tell the police that Madhu is not involved in this case, then he can escape. However, he is shocked to see Kulandai having forgotten his past. The case is handled by Dheena, who now gets a good chance to reject Madhu, as he doubts that he is a terrorist. Dheena plans to kill both of them in an encounter, but Madhu and Kulandai manage to escape. With help from Bhargavi, they all hide in her friend's flat, which happens to be just below the flat in which Chotta is hiding, in the same apartment. Chotta plans his attack in two days and sends the bombs to his associates. He tells them that he will mention the locations one hour prior, using the draft communication.
Madhu and Bhargavi take Kulandai to a doctor, Thillai (M.S. Baskar) and try to regain his memory using hypnotherapy. Thillai successfully makes him regain his memory and he reveals that he too is innocent like Madhu. Madhu urges him to recall anything, while Kulandai gave lift to Chotta. Kulandai tells them that Chotta made a phone call from the petrol bunk's public phone and using lip reading, he manages to get the gmail username of Chotta and his associates. However, he could not get the password, as Chotta was turned the other side while saying that on the phone. With help from his friend in a telecom industry, Madhu gets the number to which Chotta made the call and tracks down the number to the same apartment in which they are currently staying at.

Balki starts threatening Agal to sleep with him. Enraged, Selvam decides to take the matter in his own hands. With the help of a private detective, he gets the complete details of Balki and confronts him.

She comes only to tell him to leave her alone or she would tell her husband about him. Balki ignores her threats by coming straight to her home. Both Selvam and Agal pretend to be nice to him in order to keep their own secrets while Balki enjoys himself tormenting them.
To provoke Selvam even further, Balki leaks a tapping of the assistant police commissioner in order to get Selvam into trouble. Thinking he would get into trouble, Selvam is instead congratulated by his superior for putting fear in government officials and preventing them from ever misusing their privilege any further. However, when the scandal escalates, the higher-ups in the police decide they need a scapegoat to take responsibility and they try to frame Selvam. Realizing that his superior is manipulative, he threatens to leak their secret conversations unless they leave him alone. He also realizes that Balki is tormenting him for fun and is not serious about leaking the rest of the files. Selvam goes to meet Balki's estranged father to get his help to bring down the sociopath.
Selvam's Benami has invested all the money they have looted so far on the construction of a luxurious holiday resort in Langkawi, Malaysia. Selvam ignores all of Balki's phone calls and instead takes Agal to the resort for a short vacation. Once there, he reveals that he has been approached to become the head of security for this new resort and he plans to leave the police force. At the same time, Balki is infuriated that Selvam is ignoring him and comes to the resort to confront him. While Selvam is away, Balki breaks into their holiday suite and tries to rape Agal. As he is about to corner her, he falls unconscious, allowing Agal to escape. At the same time, Selvam returns and manages to break into Balki's Swiss account by using his eye for recognition. He erases all of the stolen data and saves everyone. It is then revealed that after Balki's father met with Selvam, he finally convinced his son to allow the old man to live with him, albeit as a servant. To stop Balki from doing anymore harm to society, his father has been slowly poisoning him with small doses of poison that eventually leads him into a permanent vegetative state.
Selvam and Agal return to India to make the final arrangements before they immigrate overseas. However, Selvam's Benami is shown mysteriously dead but is actually killed by the private detective (Susi Ganeshan) to loot all the property amassed by Selvam."

Maayavan,"The film starts with the death of a renowned neurologist and scientist Pramodh. His mysterious gym trainer (Sai Dheena) is seen paying his gesture of respect at the funeral before leaving. The plot then shifts to a young crime inspector Kumaran (Sundeep Kishan) chasing a petty thief, where by coincidence he witnesses the same gym trainer murdering his own wife. Kumaran chases the murderer who corners him and halts him with a blow to the head. In the ensuring tussle, Kumaran manages to kill the murderer. A meeting with psychiatrist Aadhirai (Lavanya Tripathi) ends on a rough note when she deems him medically unfit to rejoin the police force. Later when he himself faces symptoms which attribute to PTSD, he mends his ways with Aadhirai who helps him overcome his disorder. A second murder happens in which a famous actress is killed. Kumaran visits the spot and finding the similar blood stains from the earlier murder and many other similarities, including the same brand of cigarette smoked by the murderer, he is stressed up and gets into a shock. Aadhirai finds him and treats him for his PTSD and makes him normal. He meets with Rudhran and introduces her to him as a motivational speaker. Kumaran, now fitter, sets out his investigation and finds out that a makeup man (Mime Gopi) must have done the murder as he is the prime suspect. Upon investigation, He also gets to know that both the makeup man and the gym trainer showed a totally different behavior, few days before they committed the murders. Kumaran tracks down the makeup man but he jumps to death before confessing anything.
Next Murder happens and the victim now is a renowned scientist Mr. Narayanan (Kathi Ravi). Kumaran tries to find some evidences in the scientist's home and he finds a book written by Rudhran. Thinking that Rudhran might know the scientist, Kumaran visits Rudhran's office and finds that his behavior has changed. His own dog starts to bark at him and he has also started to smoke recently, that too the same brand that was found in the earlier murders. Kumaran deduces that some strange thing is happening and Rudhran could either be murdered or become the next murderer. He nabs Rudhran when he shows his more ruthless and cold blooded side when he kills his own dog. So Kumaran takes Rudhran into custody and while signing on the FIR, Rudhran signs a different name, and then corrects it to his own sign. Kumaran notices this and finds out that, the first sign was signed ""Pramodh"".
A brief investigation reveals that Pramodh is a colleague of late Mr. Narayan when they worked together at Indian institute of neurosciences. A senior official Velayudham (Jayaprakash) after hearing the incidents of the case, reveals that Pramod was involved in a project called Project Maayavan, which could enable a person to store his memories into a hard drive which can be transferred to another individual by injecting a newly invented gel, which would house millions of nano-transmitters and when injected into the brain these transmitters will attach onto the neurons. When the person dies, his memories could be transmitted to another individual whose brain would already have been injected with the gel. The memories of the new person will first be erased and the old person's memories will be transferred via the nano-transmitters. This way the person (his memories) will not die and will live for ever. To prove his theory Dr. Pramod works day and night, and during this experiment he even sends a patient to coma, but he is not bothered about human life and wants to succeed in his mission. After Dr. Narayan becomes the Director of the Indian Institute of Neuroscience he stops Dr. Pramod's project.
Raged by this, Dr.Pramod uses himself as the subject and successfully transfers his memories in a hard-drive and then commits suicide. Once he dies his memories gets transferred to the Gym trainer (who was already inserted with the gel by Pramod). And once he dies, he transfers his memories to the make-up man and now to Rudhran. By the time Kumaran solves this and finds that Pramod's next target is an army general Major Sathyan (Jackie Shroff), Pramod who is now living in Rudhran's body commits suicide and finally he successfully arrives into the major's brain. The major invites Kumaran and says that his technology will let him live for more than 1000 years and no one can stop him.
With a clue from Pramod's wife, Kumaran finds his secret lab where Pramod has his memories stored. Pramod successfully retrieves the hard-drive containing his memories black-mailing Karna and in the process killing him, his wife and his children and also killing Velayudham and DIG. He then kidnaps Velayudham and goes to the institute lab to let him switch to another body. Kumaran tracks him down and a gun-fight ensues. Finally Kumaran realizes that his girl friend (psychiatrist Aadhirai) is the next subject. If the major dies Dr. Pramod memories will transfer to Aadhirai's body, leaving Kumaran with a difficult choice.
Twenty years later, Kumaran is happily married to Aadhirai and they have a son. It is then revealed that Kumaran has trapped the major in his secret basement and has kept him alive all these years."

Next morning, shooting starts as the host (Lakshmi Gopalaswamy) asks Aruvi to narrate what happened to her. Aruvi then explains that the three men are Jessy's father Joseph, Arulmani and the swamiji. Joseph had sexually abused her when she took shelter in his house. Arulmani had taken advantage of Aruvi's situation when she begged for a loan and the swamiji had hypnotized and raped her. Aruvi then reveals that she has had AIDS from the past 2 years. The infection seems to have entered through an accident, where an open wound was exposed to a carrier of HIV. She meets her friend Emily in an NGO as both of them have AIDS. Aruvi asks the three men to apologize, but Lakshmi turns against Aruvi, accusing her of intentionally infecting those men. Aruvi is appalled and states everything wrong with the society and the unnecessary stereotypes that every common man has to conform to, in order to fit into this consumeristic world.
The director uses all this drama to his advantage as this would improve his show's TRP rating. Aruvi pulls out a gun and shoots the director in the arm. Later, she calms herself and apologizes to everyone, but as she gets up to leave, Arulmani tackles her and hits Emily. This maddens Aruvi and she points the gun at him and takes everyone hostage. Hearing the gun shots, police start surrounding the studio suspecting terrorist activity. Aruvi then plays ""spin the bottle."" Whoever the bottle points at, should do whatever Aruvi says, else they would be shot. Aruvi then makes everyone do silly things as she watches, in her own way of getting back at the society that forced her into so much pain. As a part of the game, Aruvi asks Peter to propose to her which he does not do properly; so she asks him to narrate a story and he tells a story as follows: An old man happily spends his life in his village. Soon after, there happens a theft in that village for which the old man is suspected even by his own family members, which forces him to leave the village and go. During the last stages of life he remembers his past happy life and writes a letter about everything he feels to the members of his village, which he hands over to a young man in that village, who then moves to a tea shop buys a cigarette and smokes; thereafter he calls all the people who know that old man to go in search of him and find him and the story ends with the old man smiling where the story is freezed. During the game, everyone becomes friendly with Aruvi. She even forgives the three men who raped her.
She then surrenders to the police. Since Aruvi and Emily are AIDS patients, they cannot be arrested and have to be isolated Inside the camp, Aruvi's condition continues to deteriorate as she loses a lot of weight and becomes incapable of taking care of herself. One night, she disappears from the camp and moves to a village all alone. After a few days, all acquaintances of Aruvi receive a video from Aruvi on Facebook. The video shows her crying and explaining how she misses everyone and speaks about all the regrets in her life. On seeing the video, Peter gathers everyone and takes them to the village in which Aruvi currently resides (as he told the story to Aruvi for which she told that such a thing will never happen). Aruvi is finally surrounded by everyone she loves towards the end of her lifetime. Everyone she loved gave her a lot of gifts like cakes, pictures and lot. One such gift is from Peter, who gave Aruvi a greeting card, written "" Love you Aruvi, Peter"". Peter actually proposed to Aruvi in the way she liked. Then she smiled at him and was happy. And Aruvi asks Subash to spin the bottle as she did during the time of hostage and the bottle stops pointing at Aruvi which means that she can do whatever she wants till the end of her lifetime. The movie ends with Peter capturing the image of Aruvi smiling."

Velaikkaran,"Arivu (Sivakarthikeyan) hails from Kolaikkara Kuppam aka Cooliekkara Kuppam a slum area in Chennai. He is one such responsible youth, who wants to focus on the upliftment of his fellow beings and he works hard for the same. Arivu starts Kuppam FM 90.8, a local radio channel with the help of the area gangster Kasi (Prakash Raj). In reality, Arivu tries to free the people of the area from the atrocities of Kasi, who is deliberately preventing them from becoming independent, so that he may continue to dominate the area. Arivu succeeds in turning the people of the area against Kasi, thus destroying his support.
Later, Arivu joins a leading FMCG company, Saffron and joins its sales department under Stella Bruce (Thambi Ramaiah). He also manages to bring his friend Bhagya (Vijay Vasanth) out of Kasi's gang and gets him a job in Saffron. He meets Aadhi (Fahadh Faasil), the Brand Manager of Saffron, who teaches him how to progress by doing smart work and Arivu considers him as his inspiration. On the night of April 1, Kasi and his gang attack Bhagya and brutally stab him in Saffron's godown (warehouse), whereupon he dies in the hands of Arivu. Arivu filled with rage, tries to attack Kasi. But, Kasi's rival Doss (Sharath Lohitashwa) attacks and brutally stabs him in retaliation for their previous encounter and Arivu admonishes Kasi for being such a paid henchman. Kasi reveals to Arivu that he killed Bhagya on a contract given by Jayaram (Anish Kuruvilla) the President of Saffron company, due to the fact that Bhagya tries to help Kasthuri (Sneha), who files a case claiming Saffron's products to be adulterated, due to which she had lost her son. Arivu is addressed by Kasi as being a worse hitman than he himself is. Arivu then saves Kasi. Arivu is also told by Kasi that all the products manufactured by his company are adulterated. He takes up a mission to fight such malpractices not only in Saffron, but also in all the other five major food companies, including the company owned by Madhav Kurup (Mahesh Manjrekar). Arivu shares all of his plans with Aadhi. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Aadhi is actually Adhiban Madhav and he is the son of Madhav Kurup. He joined Saffron to know their trade secrets and merge the company with his father's company.
Arivu manages to convince the staff of his company to manufacture products as per Government regulations for two days, while he convinces the staff of the other companies to wear a kerchief on their dresses for the next two days, thus tricking the owners into believing that their workers have turned against them. But, Aadhi manages to foil this plan of Arivu and coerces the other owners to write over the major shares of their company to Madhav Kurup, thus making him the deciding authority of all their companies. Aadhi then manages to turn all the employees against Arivu by tricking them into believing that Arivu worked as a spy for Madhav Kurup. Stella Bruce then slaps Arivu and humiliates him, while Aadhi pretends to defend Arivu claiming that he is innocent and it is the new president who conspired all these. After this, Arivu reveals to Aadhi that Stella Bruce was his ally and he now knows that Aadhi is the true traitor. Aadhi then burns down the go down containing the unadulterated products and reveals to Arivu that he is the son of Madhav Kurup, and that he will be the next CEO of the company. He also convinces the staff through his clever tactics and makes them propose his name as the new CEO, also revealing to Arivu that he will make them manufacture adulterated products without their knowledge, now that he command their loyalty, support and trust.
Arivu goes to the Radio Mirchi radio station on the same day, which a night before May 1 and reveals that after the fire accident, one of the injured department heads of Saffron Karpaga Vinayagam (Ramdoss) called him into the ambulance and told him that he followed the regulations on the third day too. Arivu also got to know from the other team workers of Saffron Kennedy (Mansoor Ali Khan), Vinoth (Kaali Venkat), Ansari (Aruldoss) and Sivaranjani (Vinodhini Vaidyanathan) that after manufacturing quality products for two days, they could not bring themselves to manufacture adulterated products on the next day, and they all followed Government regulations, thus manufacturing quality products on the next day too. Aadhi now the CEO, hears the workers say that they will rebel against him and depose him if tries to revert to manufacturing adulterated products. Arivu further adds that the loyalty of all the employees in each and every field shouldn't be wasted by showing it towards unethical employers. Aadhi vents out his frustration on the permanent failure of his plan.
All the people in the city shows their support to Arivu. Arivu celebrates his success along with Mrinalini (Nayanthara) his love interest, his friends, his family, the people of his slum and the people of the city as the movie ends."

Shailu then asks Hari to leave the place as soon as possible as it would cause no benefit to him. 2 days prior to the marriage, Shailu hugs Hari as she thinks she would lose him forever which is seen by the house maid. She then tells Shailu's mother that she thinks Shailu is not happy with the marriage, upon asking Shailu to which she agrees. The next day while her mother shares this experience to the family, Srinivas Rao gets a call that Shailu has been kidnapped. He orders Hari to get her back to which he succeeds. Now Maharshi tells everything to the family members about their love story upon which Hari and Maharishi are thrown out of the house by Amar.

Soggade Chinni Nayana,"Ram ""Ramu"" Mohan is a socially-inept cardiologist practicing in the United States. His wife, Seetha, feels lonely since Ramu pays very little attention to her because of his work. They decide to divorce and leave for Sivapuram, Rajahmundry, where Ramu's mother Satyabhama lives. Satyabhama, shocked to learn that Ramu and Seetha are divorcing, shouts at a portrait of her deceased husband Bangarraju (a benevolent, flirtatious zamindar who died nearly 30 years ago in an accident).
Bangarraju's soul is in Naraka, where he continues to flirt. Yama, at Shiva's command, sends him back to earth because there is a mission only he can fulfil. Bangarraju, who can be seen and heard only by Satyabhama, tries to solve his family's problems. After several unsuccessful attempts, Bangarraju possesses Ramu's body on his birthday. He meets Ramu's young female cousins, and invites them to his home. On his way back Ramu meets Suri, a frightened drunk who runs away as Ramu and Bangarraju look identical. To free himself from guilt, Suri later admits that he murdered Bangarraju with a lorry after he was bribed. Before he can disclose more details, Suri dies in an accident and Bangarraju learns that his family is in danger. Ramu spends quality time with his cousins, making Seetha jealous.
Bangarraju is confronted by Satyabhama, who is unaware of recent events. He suggests that she help Seetha impress Ramu. At Satyabhama's suggestion, Ramu and Seetha go to a theatre to watch a film. When she is taunted, Ramu (possessed by Bangarraju) overpowers her tormenters. Seetha is pleasantly surprised, since Ramu failed to confront the same group earlier in a similar situation. The couple slowly grow closer, and Seetha realises that Ramu does love her. Bangarraju learns from Athmanandam, a godman who can communicate with souls, that his uncle Rudraraju masterminded his murder. Rudraraju and his cousin, Veerababu, wanted to steal jewellery from a 1,000-year old temple to Shiva. They murdered Bangarraju, bribing Suri to silence him.
After Rudraraju's son dies when he is bitten by a divine snake, a tantrik warns that only Bangarraju's descendants can open the lock; others would be killed by the snake. The tantrik captures Bangarraju's soul and gives a few threads to Sampath, Rudraraju's grandson, telling him to tie them to the hands of every member of Bangarraju's family to keep his soul from communicating with them. After Sampath and the others leave, the snake kills the tantrik and saves Bangarraju's soul.
Bangarraju reaches the temple, where Satyabhama can neither see nor hear him and he cannot possess Ramu. Rudraraju and Sampath attack Ramu and Seetha after the jewellery is removed from the treasury. Rudraraju tells his henchmen to put the couple in a car with the jewellery, which will make the villagers think that they are the thieves. The thread to Ramu's hand comes loose, and Bangarraju possesses him. Bangarraju fights them and retrieves the jewellery before leaving Ramu, who operates on an injured Seetha in a nearby hospital. Satyabhama removes the thread and can see Bangarraju. Ramu and Seetha reconcile, and Yama orders Bangarraju to come back in accordance with Shiva's instructions. When Satyabhama begs Bangarraju to stay, Yama gives him a chance to wipe away her tears. He asks her to keep smiling and live happily for his sake, and returns to Naraka."

One day, as Kasi talks to a few girls in a room, they compel her to show them a mole on her waist and as she does, a curious Ajay who overheard them laughing while eating downstairs, walks into the room and sees the mole. The rest of the girls rush out of the room, leaving Kasi and Ajay alone where both of them are clearly shown to be interested in each other.
The festival of Lord Rama's Kalyanam arrives. Ajay falls in love with Kasi and conveys his feelings to Kasi, who accepts his love indirectly and says that they still have 3 months to know each other. The family celebrates the festival with happiness and joy. Later, Ajay and Kasi go out for a night-drive where they spend time with each other. As they are walking down an empty tunnel to Ajay's car, Ajay asks Kasi to dance with him. But Kasi jokingly refuses, saying she'll dance only if they have an audience. She tells him that boys only want hugs and kisses, not love.
A businessman (Jaya Prakash Reddy) offers to buy the paint factory but Ajay's father refuses as he feels that his family will break into pieces if he sells the factory for money. Later, Ajay and Kasi go to a marketplace to drink tea, where Ajay asks for her to dance again and convinces her by saying that she has the whole marketplace for an audience. He climbs onto a platform and tells her to dance there with him after she removes her footwear. She does as she was told and climbs onto the platform, only to realise that the platform is a huge ice bar. Ajay laughs at her as he took his sweet revenge but she joins him anyway and they dance. Meanwhile, Ajay's uncle is nervous about bringing up the topic of Ajay's marriage with hi daughter in a conversation with Ajay's father. Ajay takes Kasi to the factory, where they spend quality time with each other by talking about themselves and their future together, which finally ends in a paint-war.
Ajay thinks that the whole family should go on a vacation to take a break from their lives and his father decides to go to Ooty. Ajay and Kasi make out with each other during the trip and their love for each other deepens. Meanwhile, Ajay's father visits a park to spend some time alone where he befriends a 5-year-old girl before he knows that she has an illness that is going to take her life soon enough. As he later gets to know this, he tells her to pray everyday to god to give her another day and god will give her that extra day as god is kind. He later writes in his diary that it is unfair for the girl to die young as she has not tasted life at all at a tender age of 5. Kasi starts thinking about how her life will change as she now loves Ajay and asks her father how he would feel if she just stayed at this place, with Ajay's family for life, instead of learning and travelling around extensively as she had planned to before. The family continues its vacation and everyone enjoy it.
One day, as all of them are spending an afternoon dancing, Ajay notices Kasi who just arrived and waves at her to join him and dance with him. She shakes her head, conveying that she doesn't want to and Ajay stops dancing, walks to her and stands next to her, both of them watching the family dance. He asks her if she wants to go somewhere else and after she approves, they walk around. They walk in each other's silence and Ajay senses that Kasi is disturbed by something. They finally reach a lake when he asks her if she wants to leave him and he tells her that he will not leave her even if she gives him a hundred reasons. Kasi replies saying that she fits well in his heart but not in his family and that when she pictures his family, she cannot see herself in it. She says that she wants to see more in life and do many things that she still hasn't. She requests him to free themselves of each other and tells him, in tears, that life will lead them to different people who might love them as immensely and deeply as they loved each other. Ajay feels that if he truly loves her, he should let her go when she wants him to. They kiss and hold each other for some time, before Kasi walks away. Ajay's uncle sees them as the kiss but doesn't intrude their moment. He leaves the hotel and goes home because he is angry that Ajay and Kasi will marry each other, not knowing that they have parted ways. When Ajay's cousin tells everybody about her father's departure without a reason, an already heart-broken Ajay cancels the trip and everybody return home.
Ajay's Uncle finally confronts Ajay's father about his feelings and leaves the house saying there is no more attachment between them. Ajay's father, stabbed by his brother-in-law's words, dies due to extreme sadness and confusion after telling Ajay that every family member is important and losing one is unacceptable. Ajay's life is dimmed without his father and his love. After some days, he thinks that he should bring his uncle back into the family. Around the same time, Ajay's sister's friend , an NRI from London (Samantha Ruth Prabhu), comes to town and insists that she stays in Ajay's house as she finds Ajay to be handsome. Later, Ajay tells her that he is in love with Kasi, but nothing more than that. Ajay visits his uncle and asks him to forget the past and come back home but angrier that Ajay's father has the sympathy of death and that he made him look like a murderer, Ajay's Uncle refuses.
Later one day, Ajay's sister's friend casually says how interesting it would be to know your relatives who date back to at least seven generations in timeline. Struck by the thought, Ajay sets on a journey to search and recruit his relatives, who have lost contact with time. He befriends Lakkavarapu ""Lilly"" Lingaraju (Vennela Kishore), who is also his relative. Ajay's cousin meets Ajay to tell him that her marriage has been fixed with another man. Ajay's uncle later meets Ajay's sister's friend and tells her that he really respects Ajay and his father, tells her that he still wishes Ajay to be his daughter's husband and tells her even though he is aware of the fact that Ajay won't marry his daughter, he wants her to stay away from him. Ajay's sister's friend goes to Ajay to bid farewell and kisses him before she leaves.
Ajay returns home to his mother (Revathi) and looks at the house, once full of people and melodious with everyone's laugh, now empty and deafening with silence. The day of his cousin's marriage arrives and he goes to the wedding, despite his mother's disapproval. Ajay confronts his Uncle and asks him to come home, also telling him about his father's will written in his diary stating that the entire property under his name should go to his brother-in-law, not even to his son, because he is the only one who was with him during dark times and without his help, their family wouldn't have been where they are today. Ajay's uncle regrets his selfish and foolish behaviour and praises Ajay's father's big heart. Ajay and his Uncle reunite.

Dhruva,"A low-level party cadre Chengalrayudu (Posani Krishna Murali) is tying a flag to a street-lamp post. Suddenly his pregnant wife goes into labour, but he completely ignores it, as he is more dedicated to his leader and party. At the same time, the party's deputy leader (Nassar) visits the locality; as soon as he comes to know about this incident, the leader lends his car and orders his driver to immediately take the pregnant lady to the hospital; she delivers a baby boy named Venkanna before they get to the hospital. At the age of fifteen, Venkanna secures first rank in his 10th standard state exam and visits the party deputy-leader, now the chairman of the party and a member of the ruling coalition for his blessings with his father. While they are waiting in the party office for the leader to come in, they witness a murder of a rebel party candidate by their own revered leader due to caste-related comments by the rebel on him. When the leader asks Chengalrayudu to take the blame by saying that he killed the man due to rage about the rebel's comments, Venkanna volunteers to take the blame and is willing to go to jail, citing the leniency of juvenile laws in exchange for an MLA seat for his father in the upcoming by-election. The deal is agreed and carried out.
15 years later, Dhruva (Ram Charan) and his friends Gowtham (Navdeep), Ranveer (Randhir Gattla) and others are a small group of trainee IPS officers who discreetly assist the police, one activity being catching a gang which kidnapped four girls. One day Dhruva receives a cryptic text message on his phone from an anonymous number stating that he/she is aware of their discreet activities. In the evening, they go out to meet that person who is revealed to be Ishika (Rakul Preet Singh), who loves Dhruva. Later that same night they happen to witness the murder of a man who is a social activist with the pretense of snatch theft. Dhruva and his friends catch the gang and their leader (Shekar) and hand them over to the police; however, four days later the leader of the gang comes to the IPS headquarters with the home minister. This political and organised crime comes as a shock to Dhruva and his friends. Dhruva takes them to his house and shows his research on connecting all small unrelated incidents into the global view of a hidden network of politicians, industrialists and criminals who bend the law for their own financial benefits. He singles out three prominent business oligarchs, including pharmaceutical mogul Dheeraj Chandra (Sayaji Shinde), don Irfan Ali (Madhusudhan Rao) and a minister. When Dhruva tries following Dheeraj Chandra, he realises that all three of them work as a group and they all work for an affluent scientist Siddharth Abhimanyu (Aravind Swamy). After the completion of his training, Dhruva is awarded medals for specializing in dealing with organized crime during training and also for being the best probationer of the batch, and is posted as the ASP of the Organized Crime Unit.
Dhruva discovers that Siddharth is Chengalrayudu's son Venkanna. After his release from juvenile detention center, Venkanna had his name changed and left India to complete his education abroad. After his graduation he returned to India and is now a well established scientist. Siddarth uses the medical field for the wrong reasons and his own profit. Chengalrayudu is now the incumbent health and welfare minister in the minority government headed by the party leader. At that time Angelina, a Swiss pharmaceutical company owner and activist tries to make generic medicines for life-threatening diseases available in India at low cost affordable by poor people. Siddharth's assassin kills Angelina before she can sign the agreement document with the government and shoots Dhruva at the same time. While he is recovering from the gunshot wound in the hospital with the help of Ishika and Gowtham, an electronic bug (GPS + audio transmitter) is implanted during surgery. Through the bug, Siddharth listens all of Dhruva's plans and continuously monitors his whereabouts and whatever he talks via audio transmission. Then comes evidence against Siddharth in the form of Akshara (Abhinaya). She was a scientist at Siddharth's research lab, where a seaweed that can cure diabetes is found abundantly in the oceans. Siddharth tries to sell the technology and rights to extract medicine from the seaweed to multinational pharmaceutical companies but is opposed by Akshara. So Siddharth arranges goons and the goons rape and kill her. But before being killed, she records a video and stores it in an SD card so that someone will find it. But before Dhruva can find the card, Siddharth finds out and assigns Abbas to recover the card, but Dhruva tells Gowtham to get the card. Gowtham goes to the house where the SD card is at. He successfully gets the card after a fight with Abbas, but through the bug Siddharth knows this and abducts Gowtham. Gowtham fights Abbas and Siddharth but he gets drugged and before Dhruva can save him, Siddharth and Abbas kill Gowtham. Dhruva comes back to his special house where he finds a pin has been changed in a picture which turns out to be the picture of Naina Miss world of 2011 and a close aquintance of Siddharth whose girlfriend Preethi was also part of that event. Dhruva doubts whether Siddharth himself would have come to his house. Ishika checks the finger prints on the pin keeping the gun case Dhruva received from Siddharth in his posting ceremony and the finger prints match. A flashback reveals that Siddharth killed Preethi's father so that she doesn't participate in the competition and as she won't have a ticket to go to her father's funeral he requests to take her in his chartered flight and wins her over. Dhruva frantically searches for the bug which he eventually finds out in a series of thrilling events.
Dhruva captures Abbas and records all the information from him. He drugs Abbas and manipulates Siddharth into killing him. At the same time, Siddharth's father reads the changed medical report, which contains very good medical contracts for public welfare and multiple accusations against the CM. When Siddharth learns about this, he ask Chengalrayudu to pretend to have chest pains and move outside to hospital. The ruling party forces Chengalrayudu either to resign within 24 hours or he will be dismissed. Dhruva appeals to the CM that he has evidence and wants to arrest Siddharth, and he is granted permission to do so. Hence Siddarth kills his father using his goons in an accident and forces the CM to stop actions against him or he will lie that the CM killed his father for personal vengeance. But the next day at his father's state funeral, Dhruva arrests him on the CM's orders.
When Siddharth is arrested, Dhruva tells him that the medicine was patented in Akshara's name (despite Siddarth being the inventor) and will be made as generic medicine instead of a patent-protected one. It is also revealed that Chengalrayudu is alive, saved by Dhruva and the public funeral held was for Gowtham. Dhruva makes a deal that he would save Siddharth's life for information and evidence on all of his criminal associates and activities and gives him a bulletproof vest to fake his death during his transport to court. They also plan to take down the set up planned by various VIPs to kill Siddharth when one of them gets close to Siddharth. Dhruva takes him down and pushes Siddharth back. To Dhruva's surprise, Siddharth does not wear the vest, and is fatally shot by his girlfriend Preethi as an act of vengeance for killing her father. Before dying, he tells Dhruva that he hid all the evidence in an SD card in the bulletproof vest, adding that he had not done it for the nation but because Dhruva had asked for it."

Khaidi No. 150,"In Kolkata, prisoner Kathi Seenu (Chiranjeevi), a petty criminal, helps the police capture an escaping prisoner, but he himself escapes afterwards. He goes to Hyderabad and decides to escape to Bangkok. However, he drops this plan after meeting and falling in love with Lakshmi (Kajal Aggarwal), his childhood friend at the airport, who dupes him into believing that she gave him her phone number realizing that he is having a crush on her. Later, Seenu and Malli (Ali), his friend notice a doppelgänger of Seenu named Shankar (Chiranjeevi), being shot by a group of thugs. They admit him to a hospital, following which Seenu decides to impersonate the injured Shankar to escape from the police. Under the name of his doppelgänger, Seenu and Malli enter an old-age home run by Shankar with the aim of collecting ₹25 lakhs (which is meant for the inmates of the old-age home) for their Bangkok trip, until he learns about his doppelgänger's mission. Shankar is a post-graduate in hydrology from the arid village of Neeruru in Rayalaseema who had discovered groundwater under some lands of the village which could be used as an irrigation source not only for the village, but for the entire Rayalaseema and the neighbouring areas as well. But, an MNC owned by Aggarwal (Tarun Arora) cheated the villagers into giving their lands for the construction of a factory. Shankar was arrested by the police and the six villagers as for convince the issue with media and release of Shankar commit mass suicide. On learning of the plight of Shankar and the villagers, Seenu decides to fight for their cause while still under the name of Shankar. The people of the old home and Seenu go to the jury and try to convince him to go in favour of them, but Seenu starts stating rules and scares the main jury person (whom Aggarwal had bribed). Seenu then sends a person (disguised as a hairdresser) to Aggarwal and makes him lay a fingerprint on Aggarwal's neck. After that Aggarwal sends 50 men to kill Seenu but he soon defeats them using the coins the Lion Club member gave when he was attending a ceremony for him.
Meanwhile, the real Shankar gains consciousness and finds himself in the Kolkata prison where Seenu was locked up. With the help of the man who Seenu helped capture, who has heard his story and has plans to kill Seenu in revenge for getting him caught and thrown back into prison, he soon escapes along with the prisoner's henchmen.
Not knowing that Shankar and the henchmen are headed for Hyderabad, Seenu makes efforts to convince the media to bring the plight of the villagers to national consciousness, but the media is not interested as they feel that it is not a sensational news. A few days later, at the high court, the judge declares the verdict in favour of Seenu and the villagers, but adds that Aggarwal has claimed that certain villagers who are working abroad have shown their support for the factory. If they cannot prove that their support was faked by Aggarwal within the next five days, the verdict will then go in favour of Aggarwal and the villagers will lose their lands. Since the villagers, who have denied supporting the factory, are abroad and cannot come to Hyderabad within five days to rebut Aggarwal's claims as their passports are held by their contractors, and the verdict is to be decided within five days, Seenu decides to take drastic measures to sensationalize the issue. He, Lakshmi, Malli and the inmates of the old-age home block water supply to Hyderabad by sitting on the pipelines which carry water to Hyderabad. With the plight of the Hyderabad people due to no water supply having gained national attention, Seenu comes out of the pipeline after a few days and highlights the villagers' plight in an emotionally charged speech to the media, which is telecast nationwide and moves many people.
Meanwhile, Shankar and the henchmen reach Hyderabad, but Shankar is soon kidnapped by Aggarwal's henchmen. While in Aggarwal's custody, he sees Seenu's speech on television and is moved by the efforts made by his doppelgänger to help the villagers. On the night before the verdict, Seenu's bluff is exposed, but Seenu assures the old men that he is genuinely interested in their cause, that Shankar is alive and that he will rescue Shankar from Aggarwal and hand him back over to the villagers with the assurance of a positive verdict. Seenu goes to Aggarwal's office, where Shankar is being held. He rescues Shankar and fights Aggarwal. Shankar kills Aggarwal when he was about to kill Seenu.
The next day, the verdict is declared in favour of Shankar and the villagers. The Kolkata police find Seenu and arrest him. Seenu assures Lakshmi that he will be back shortly."
Gautamiputra Shatakarni,"Gautamiputra Satakarni (Nandamuri Balakrishna) is 2nd century AD Satavahana ruler of Amaravati who has a dream from his childhood that to unite all the 32 kingdoms in the country under one roof, to stop internal collisions between the rulers to establish peace. He takes oath on his mother Gautami Balashri (Hema Malini) and starts his mission at the age of 18 and he gives only two options to the kings on his way either peace by surrendering their sword to him or war. It takes 18 long years to achieve his goal and takes entire South India under his control. Time being Satakarni marries Vashishthi Devi (Shriya Saran) and they have a son Pulumavi (Master Snehit Chowdary).
Nahapana (Kabir Bedi) important ruler of the Western Kshatrapas, who is very powerful & crooked king, who forcibly puts all the princes of his feudatory kingdoms as royal prisoners and keeps a condition that they all should obey his orders and protect his kingdom from 4 sides. So it is a very difficult and final task to Satakarni to reach Nahapana for that he uses a strategy and decides to take his son Pulumavi along with him to the war field but his wife Vashishthi does not agree to it even then he ruthlessly takes his son. On the other hand Demetrius (David Manucharov) the Greek Emperor is waiting at the border to conquer India, he is just waiting for the result of the battle between Satakarni & Nahapana. Meanwhile, Satakarni starts moving towards Nahapana’s dynasty along with his son and promises all the feudatory kings on the way that he will safeguard & secure their children and definitely brings them back. Finally, he reaches Nahapana’s fort destroys him, protects the princes and brings the entire country under one flag.
After that Satakarni returns to Amaravathi along with 32 swords of the entire rulers of India, his mother Gautami Balashri orders to make a powerful sword by melting all these 32 swords. Everybody welcomes him with great enlightenment & joy, but his wife Vashishthi is fed-up his dictatorial mentality and decides to leave him along with the children. But now he has to perform Rajasuya Yaaga, a grand ritual made by the ruler who defeated all other kings in the earth and eligible to rule the whole world, which is impossible without a wife. So, on her mother-in-law’s request, Vashishthi agrees to stay until the completion of ritual. During the time of ritual the Emperor has to give Agra Pooja special honor to the top most person in the kingdom, Satakarni gives it to his mother by spreading the greatness of women and from that day he keeps his name Gautamiputra Satakarni and he also name’s his son as Vasishthiputra Pulumavi where his wife Vasishthi also realizes her mistake and understands greatness of her husband. From that day Satakarni starts a new era calling Salivahana Sakha and the day starting as Ugadi. On that night Kanjira (Milind Gunaji) one of the feudatory kings mixes hands with Demetrius and helps his men to enter into the fort to kill Satakarni but his mother protects him by breaking up their tactics.
Now Satakarni comes to know that Demetrius has arrived into to the borders of Sindhu Kingdom to conquer India whose army is 10 times more than his. Even then he decides to get ready for the final battle at that time his wife Vashishthi gets some bad signs that someone has given poison to her husband. So she requests him not to go to the battle where Satakarni explains her regarding his childhood dream of uniting the entire country which he had done so, now he has to protect it from invaders by exorcising them. So he doesn’t have any other choice except to go to the battle. Gauthami Balasri consults a Bhikkhu explains him regarding these bad signs and he answers that may come true, so he gives anti-dote to the poison.
At last Satakarni reaches the Sindhu Kingdom along with his feudatory kings, during the first day of the war Satakrani destroys almost half of Greek army. Now Demetrius understands it is difficult to conquer India until Satakarni is alive. So plays a dirty trick by sending a women Athena (Farah Karimaee) as a messenger for peace who gives poison to Satakrani. Next day morning Satakarni is under treatment all other Kings are under dichotomy whether to go to war or go back, but they understands the real aim of Satakarni is not only to win the country but he also want to develop unity among the kingdoms, so they all decides either to win or die in the battle. Meanwhile, Satakarni wakes up from the deathbed, reaches the battlefield, defeats Demetrius and leaves him alive by finally saying a word that no one can destroy the unity of India"

Ghazi,"The Indian Navy decodes a secret code sent from Pakistan to then-East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh) and intelligence report of a Pakistan Navy's submarine called PNS Ghazi, a much more advanced submarine than S21 or any other Indian submarine, being sent through the Bay of Bengal under the command of Cdr. Razak Khan (Rahul Singh). The top command dispatches S21, a submarine, under the command of Capt. Ranvijay Singh (Kay Kay Menon) for surveillance. To temper Singh's belligerent tendencies, the Indian Navy Admiral assigns Lt. Commander Arjun Varma (Rana Daggubati), with orders to ensure that Singh does not confront any Pakistani warships and trigger a war.
Ghazi blasts a merchant ship to divert attention of the Indian Navy, that has been sent to sink the sole Indian air-craft carrier, INS Vikrant. Arjun saves a girl child and a woman (Taapsee Pannu), who are Bangladeshi refugees. During surveillance, S21 acquires a sonar signal of Ghazi.
Singh believes that they should track down Ghazi and attack, while Arjun obstructs. Singh then orders the ship's XO, Santosh Devraj (Atul Kulkarni) to conduct a drill and target Ghazi while doing so. They miss their target narrowly and in the process alert Ghazi of their presence. Razak, orders his crew to head towards Visakhapatnam Port at full speed and to set up mines en-route so that S21 is destroyed in their pursuit.
S21 pursues Ghazi's path and realizes at the last moment that it is headed into mines. It tries to change its course but a mine explodes and damages most of the batteries, propellers and circuits and the compartment with the front torpedoes gets flooded. Singh dies while trying to save Arjun as S21 sinks to the sea-bed.
Meanwhile, Arjun, who by now is in charge of the mission, regroup and work towards reviving S21. The crew notices that the ship is incapable of moving in any direction, except up or down. Since they cannot chase Ghazi, the crew artificially triggers a one of the naval mines in its vicinity to make Ghazi return. Razak, sensing that Ghazi could be walking into a trap, diverts the ship's path and starts attacking S21.
Six torpedoes fired by Ghazi are avoided by S21 through depth changing maneuvers. S21 dives to 350m so that it is no longer within Ghazi's sonar range despite being designed for a maximum of 250m depth. With very limited battery support, Arjun instigates Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing 'Saare Jahaan se Achchha' and the Indian National Anthem. Riled up by S21's defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on S21, for which Ghazi will have to turn by 180 degrees. Arjun, dives into the flooded compartment to manually trigger the torpedoes and successfully triggers a torpedo. Ghazi also launches its torpedo at the same time. The Ghazi torpedo misses S21 narrowly, but it is hit by an S21 torpedo and disintegrates in water. Arjun is later saved alive from the flooded compartment."

But, they mistake Sri for the target and beat him hard, while leaving him unconscious on the road. They also take away his certificates and his mobile cell phone. Later, one of the rowdies throws his certificate files into a taxi cab car and kept the phone. The taxi cab car is a rental car owned by P.K. Pandian otherwise known as PKP, the city's most powerful don. Charle is the taxi cab driver who leases the car from PKP and he comes to know that if any problem happens with the car, it will be dealt severely by PKP's henchmen. Charle finds the certificates and give it to the local police station.
Sri wakes up the next morning from the roadside and is shocked about the happenings in the city, while getting a bad impression about it. He calls his friend and he comes, takes him to his home where he freshens up, and leaves to report to job. Meanwhile, Sundeep tells his parents that he is going for an interview and boards into a particular bus in which the man, who he punched earlier travels. His aim is to attack that guy with acid. Unknowingly, Sri passes the bottle of acid in the bus to him and Sundeep carries out the attack and escapes. The police take Sri into custody, as he passed the bottle. The police inspector is angry with Sri for his straightforward talk and slaps him. Sri's certificates are also in the same police station with the police constable. The constable takes out Sri for a tea break , where Sri identifies one of Sundeep's friends, who was involved in the attack. Sri nabs him and hands him over to the police. He then reports to Regina and tells her that he doesn't want this job as he doesn't like the city. He also tells her that he lost his certificates and will get eventually fired if he doesn't produce them. Regina gives him a one day time to find the certificates and return to his job.

Ravi Udyawar,"Biology teacher Devki is vivacious and popular among her students. In a class, a student, Mohit sends Devki's stepdaughter, Arya a lewd video and Devki throws his phone out of the window. At home, despite Devki's persistent and warm approach toward her, Arya remains frosty and distant, rebuffing her attempts to build a relationship. Arya is invited to a Valentine's Day party at a farmhouse; Devki permits this with great hesitation. Arya rebuffs Mohit and his hotshot buddy Charles at the party. Incensed by this very public snub, Charles, Mohit, Jagan and the watchman Babu attack Arya when she leaves the party. They rape her and dump her in a drain. Devki and her husband Anand are shattered. Arya recovers and releases a statement naming her attackers.
Inspector Matthew quickly rounds up the attackers. However, the case falls apart when Arya was found to be drinking, thus building the argument that her memory is unreliable. The body samples were recovered very late and were too weak to match the attackers. The judge acquits the four attackers due to lack of evidence. Her lawyer suggests appealing to a higher court but Devki has lost faith. Arya, still in shock and broken by the court verdict, tears away from Devki. In sorrow, Devki realizes she has probably lost Arya forever.
Devki recalls the somewhat shady detective, DK, she'd met on the night Arya was raped. A father of a daughter himself, he understands her pain and agrees to help her as Devki wants to avenge Arya.
The watchman is first. Devki seeks the help of her former students - transgender people who understand her plight. They seduce the watchman and drug him. He awakes four days later, still drunk, and finds, to his horror, that he has been castrated and remembers nothing. The hotshot Charles is next. Devki breaks into his home and mixes crushed apple seeds – a source of cyanide – into his fitness powder. Charles is paralyzed. When Mohit visits Charles at the hospital, Devki, tipped off by DK, plants apple seeds and other evidence at Mohit’s home. Inspector Matthew quickly arrests Mohit; Charles will die soon and Mohit will be the murderer. As Devki takes down each of Arya's attackers, their situations make it on the news, which Arya follows with surprise. Matthew finds Devki’s glasses in Mohit’s apartment and starts suspecting her.
Matthew confronts Devki but there is no evidence. He warns her that the fourth man, Jagan, is a hard criminal: going after him is dangerous for her family. Jagan visits Charles and learns that it is Devki who is retaliating. He goes after DK and discovers that Devki is on a holiday at a snow cottage. He kills DK and goes after Devki. Matthew discovers a hidden camera in DK’s sunglasses and hurries to save Devki.
Jagan cuts power at the cottage and shoots Anand. There is a scuffle and Arya runs out into the snow. Jagan pursues her and Devki tries to save her. As Jagan is about to kill Devki, Matthew intercepts and tackles Jagan. There is a standoff: Devki points a gun at Jagan and Matthew attempts to talk her down. Arya, in the bushes, overhears Jagan when he angrily relates how Devki finished off the other attackers. Devki knows if Jagan is left alive he will come after her again. At this point, Matthew hands her his gun and urges her to kill him. Devki hesitates but when an overwhelmed Arya acknowledges Devki as ‘Mom’ for the first time, Devki shoots Jagan dead."
Kizumonogatari Part 1: Tekketsu,"Koyomi Araragi, a second year high school student at Naoetsu High School, befriends Tsubasa Hanekawa, the top honors student at his school. Tsubasa mentions a rumor about a “blonde vampire” that has been sighted around their town recently. Koyomi, who is usually anti-social, takes a liking to Tsubasa’s down-to-earth personality. That evening, Koyomi encounters this rumored vampire: she is Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, also known as the “King of Apparitions.” The blonde, golden-eyed vampire cries out for Koyomi to save her as she lies in a pool of her own blood, all four of her limbs having been cut off by three vampire hunters. Kiss-shot asks Koyomi to give her his blood in order to save her life, and when he does, Koyomi finds himself reborn as her vampire subordinate.
Now a vampire, Koyomi is charged with retrieving Kiss-shot's severed limbs from the vampire hunters who took them. Before he confronts the first hunter, the gigantic full-vampire Dramaturgy, he has a conversation with Tsubasa. He hides his vampire nature, but Tsubasa is still interested in the rumors about vampires being spread around. At the fight, Dramaturgy tears Koyomi's arms off in one blow, but Koyomi discovers his vampire power of rapid regeneration. Seeing the fight as lost, Dramaturgy surrenders Kiss-shot's leg to Koyomi. At the time, Kiss-shot has taken the form of a child. But she morphs into a young teenager after she consumes her adult leg.
Koyomi next fights the vampire-human half-breed Episode, who can transform into mist and wields a giant silver cross as a weapon. Tsubasa walks into the fight and is disemboweled by Episode. Before she dies, Tsubasa points out to Koyomi that he can defeat Episode by throwing sand into his mist form. Koyomi uses sand to overwhelm Episode and beats Episode savagely. Meme Oshino, an ally of Kiss-shot, gets Koyomi to calm down and, for a price of ¥3 million, informs Koyomi that he can use his own blood to heal Tsubasa. Koyomi then uses his own blood to save Tsubasa's life. Consumption of the second leg enables Kiss-shot to morph into a young adult.
Koyomi now must face the fully human priest Guillotine Cutter for Kiss-shot's arms. Before the fight, he desperately pleads with Tsubasa to leave for her own safety. Tsubasa ultimately agrees, leaving her panties with Koyomi as a promise that they will reunite later. Nonetheless, Guillotine Cutter kidnaps Tsubasa, and Meme advises that Koyomi must ""forget about being human again"" in order to rescue her. Koyomi uses a power to transform his arms into tree roots to defeat Guillotine Cutter and save Tsubasa, but appears to have abandoned his wish to become human again.
Koyomi and Meme finally succeed at fully restoring Kiss-shot. Koyomi expects Kiss-Shot to then change him back to human. But before that, Kiss-shot and Koyomi spend an evening on a rooftop, where Kiss-shot reminisces about her previous subordinate, a Samurai who chose to commit suicide when Kiss-shot was not able to restore his humanity. Koyomi goes off to buy food, but when he returns he finds Kiss-shot eating the eviscerated corpse of Guillotine Cutter. He is horrified at the realization that Kiss-Shot will now hunt humans again, and that he himself will want to hunt as well.
The realization leaves Koyomi despondent enough to want to die. But then Tsubasa appears and persuades Koyomi to stay alive. She also points out that Koyomi himself has the power to stop Kiss-shot. Tsubasa's comforting words, as well as a clumsy attempt to fondle her breasts, bring Koyomi's spirits up enough to face Kiss-shot in a fight.
Kiss-shot and Koyomi face off in the Tokyo Olympic stadium. They repeatedly tear each other's limbs and heads off, but then regenerate their appendages back. Finally, Koyomi weakens Kiss-shot by sucking out her blood. But Tsubasa suddenly realizes that Kiss-shot wants to die. Kiss-shot admits that she was going to throw the fight, and explains that she has to die to restore a subordinate's humanity, but couldn't do so for her previous subordinate because she was too scared of death. Kiss-shot demands that Koyomi kill her, but Koyomi instead yells for Meme's help. Meme proposes a solution that will ""make everyone miserable"": Koyomi will suck out Kiss-shot's blood only to the point that she is too weak to hunt humans, leaving them both quasi-versions of vampire and human. Over Kiss-shot's protestations, Koyomi chooses this path. The next day, Koyomi explains to Tsubasa that he is mostly human but does have some vampire traits. Kiss-shot now has the form of a child, and can only eat by regularly sucking Koyomi's blood."

He is shocked to find that the event was not an accident: Yui had considered a suicide pact with Shingo, with whom she apparently had an incestuous relationship, and that Shingo's suicide, which happened on the same date as Yui's, was a way to fulfill it. Dai visits Shingo's apartment and tries to hang himself, but fails. Shingo's spirit appears and confirms what the tape shows, saying that Dai may not fully understand it. As the two hug, the film returns to color.
The film ends with Dai running towards a billboard memorializing Shingo. He throws Shingo's lighter towards it and says ""Take that""."

Returning home he finds it destroyed and cries out in despair before suddenly being captured into time vortex. Meanwhile, in the 21st century, Nobita wants to run away from his home due to his mom always scolding him for getting a 0 on tests, as depicted many times in various episodes. As a result of failing to find an ideal home, Nobita decides to make a makeshift place to live, however due to land property ownership laws he fails to find a suitable location. At the same time, Shizuka, Gian, Suneo and Doraemon also want to run away from their homes as they feel their parents have been working them too hard (with the exception of Doraemon, who leaves as the family has been requested to take care of a hamster which Doraemon thinks looks too much like a mouse, an animal he hates). Nobita suggests that they should go back in time to live in a place before humans existed. The group agrees with him and travel to Japan 70,000 years ago.
To settle in, Doraemon assigns everyone a ministry. Nobita, who is given the ministry of pets, mixes the genes of different animals and creates a Pegasus, a Dragon and a Griffin. At night, the group eats the supper and decides to return home and visit here another day. On the next day, Doraemon is upset to find his dorayaki has been eaten, deducing it was the hamster. As he sets off in a rage, Gian, Shizuka and Suneo come ans is attacked by the mysterious boy from the start of the movie. Gian fights with him and manages to overpower him. At first they are annoyed as they believe Doraemon and Nobita have told someone else about their secret but it quickly turns to confusion as they find the spear the boy holds is made of real stone. Nobita's mom then comes up the stairs and in a panic, the group take the boy with them to the past.
They take the boy into the cave and when he regains consciousness, Shizuka gives him food and Doraemon uses the translation taro in order to understand him. He tells them that his name is Kukuru and he belongs to the Light Tribe, who got attacked by the Dark Tribe and enslaved all of his people. Nobita and Doraemon decide to help him. Kukuru is mistrustful as they are led by a powerful ""King of the Spirits"", Gigazombi, but as Doraemon demonstrates the secret gadgets he has, Kukuru hails him as a god much to the annoyance of Doraemon. Pegasus, Dragon and Griffin are left behind as Doraemon fears arriving on them will cause too much of a scene, and they trace the Dark Tribe using Takekoputa, eventually finding and fighting them. However their shaman proved to be strong and gave them a challenge; his ability to generate force fields is worrying to Doraemon and he wonders how an object in the Stone Age has such powers. Using the Hirarimando Doraemon reflects the shaman's attacks back to him, seemingly destroying it. They take the tribe to Japan to give them a peaceful place to live and return to the 21st century, but Nobita is worried as his pets were nowhere to be seen.
The next day, Pega finds with some help from Gri that the shaman is made of a type of ceramic that has shape memory and can restore itself. The Light Tribe is still in danger, so they once again return to prehistoric times. Unfortunately they were too late and the Dark Tribe had already taken the Light Tribe. Gigazombi appears as the hologram, challenging the protagonists to come to him and face him, which they do so. Unfortunately on the way they encounter a blizzard and Draco is separated from the group, but luckily he is found by his pets. They have a reunion.
The group without Nobita travels on to Gigazombi's hideout where they find the Light Tribe being forced to work. Gian jumps down from their hiding spot but Doraemon quickly stops time, knowing they will need to move tactfully. He uses the Toorinuge Hoop to reach the surface, but is confused by the subspace tunnel curving and the exit being in an unexpected location, a room with historic electronics everywhere. Gigazombi then appears and Doraemon is confused since time is supposedly stopped, which the former says he removed. Doraemon then realises that Gigazombi is a time traveler, like them, although he changes history for his own benefit. Gigazombi reveals that he also plans to destroy the subspace time tunnel so that no one may enter or leave this time period again. They battle for a while, but Doraemon is easily defeated as it turns out Gigazombi is from the 23rd century, making Doraemon's 22nd century gadgets outdated in comparison.
Doraemon, Shizuka, Suneo and Gian are captured and face a Siberian tiger, but Nobita and his pets come in and rescue them just in time. They disable the machine that will destroy subspace and just in time, Time Patrol and Dorami come and arrest Gigazombi. Dorami says that she found out the shape-memory ceramic the shaman was made from is manufactured in the 23rd century, which made her worried and thus called Time Patrol. Nobita and the rest of the group prepare to return to their own time although a tearful farewell is first said to Pega, Draco and Gri - because they are fantastical animals, they cannot accompany Nobita and must be moved to a zoo. Nobita eventually relents and says goodbye to his pets.
In the epilogue, Nobita's mom tells Nobita that he's going to be late for school, but gives him 10 more minutes of sleep as she finds out he was working on his homework."

Satoru has the ability to ""Rewind"", in which he is sent back to a point in the near past to prevent a person around him from enduring a fatal accident. One day, Satoru's mother, Sachiko, stays with him for the weekend. While the two are outside, Sachiko senses a man about to abduct a girl and makes Satoru remember a tragedy that happened 19 years before. Sachiko passes this information to a friend of hers, but when she is alone in Satoru's apartment, she is murdered. Satoru unsuccessfully gives chase to the killer; before he is captured by the police, who accuse him of Sachiko's murder. Satoru's Rewind activates and, to his surprise, he is sent 18 years into the past, back to his elementary school life in Hokkaido.
Trying to adjust to his ""new"" life, Satoru remembers that his Rewind comes around after the murder of Kayo Hinazuki, a classmate of his, by a child serial killer, whose identity is placed to that of Jun Shiratori, even though Satoru does not believe that. He befriends the quiet and friendless Kayo, learning that she lives with an abusive mother, Akemi, and stepfather. With his friends and Sachiko's help, Satoru manages to convince Kayo to attend a double birthday party, as the two children are revealed to have the same birthday. Despite these changes, Kayo is still murdered, and in frustration, Satoru is sent back to the present.
Still evading the police, Satoru seeks refuge in the house of Airi Katagiri, a high school student who works as a fellow part-time deliveryman. Satoru realizes that though Kayo's death still occurred, its details have changed somewhat. Believing that Satoru is wrongly blamed, Airi helps him track down Sachiko's killer. However, this only puts her in danger when her house is burned down in an arson attack, though she still attempts to help Satoru by escaping from hospital, unaware that the police are following her. Meanwhile, Satoru meets with Sachiko's friend whom she contacted earlier, Makoto Sawada, who confirms that Sachiko's killer and the child serial killer are the same person. He reunites with Airi afterward, but this only causes him to be captured by the police. Noticing one of his captors as the killer, Satoru's Rewind activates and he is once again sent to 19 years before.
To prevent Kayo from being alone, Satoru ""kidnaps"" her by taking her to live away from her mother. He and his friend Kenya Kobayashi first place her in an abandoned van, but when they learn that the van is the child killer's hideout, they move her to live in the Fujinuma residence. Satoru's teacher, Gaku Yashiro, contacts the child abuse prevention center, who take Kayo into custody after enough evidence of Akemi's abuse is revealed. Still convinced that he needs to prevent more murders from happening, Satoru watches over another quiet classmate, Misato Yanagihara, during an ice hockey competition, but she quickly leaves, while Satoru is given a ride home by Yashiro. Recounting the evidence, Satoru eventually realizes that Yashiro is the killer and has deliberately placed Misato as a decoy. To prevent Satoru from interfering again, Yashiro throws him down a river.
Satoru is sent back to 2006, this time to a timeline where both Sachiko and Kayo, who is now pregnant, are alive, where he is no longer estranged from his childhood friends, and where his manga is successfully published; at the same time, however, Airi does not recognize him, as he does not work as a deliveryman in the new timeline. The lawyer Kenya helps him track down Yashiro, who now works as a councilman. Having a face-to-face meeting, Yashiro tells Satoru his demented motive of killing: he kills to prevent the children from having a bleak future. Just when he is about to commit suicide, Satoru stops him, causing himself to get mortally wounded instead, while Yashiro is arrested.

Assassination Classroom: Graduation,"It has been six months since the start of senior year, and yet the Class 3-E of Kunugigaoka High School has not been able to assassinate their tentacled teacher, Koro-sensei, who will blow up the Earth on graduation day. Due to the school festival to be held, assistant teacher Tadaomi Karasuma instructs the class to give all they got, since Koro-sensei will be distracted, making him an easy target of killing. Karasuma also insists that the class should assassinate Koro-sensei before the government-sponsored assassin Red Eye do the same. However, neither the students nor Red Eye are ultimately able to do the task, and Koro-sensei even convinces Red Eye to give up his job for the sake of his students.
At the end of the school festival, Kaede Kayano catches Koro-sensei off guard and begins her assault by revealing her tentacles. She reveals her true identity to be a child actress named Akari Yukimura and the younger sister of Aguri, the class' former teacher and the one whom Koro-sensei promised to teach the class for. She wants to take revenge against Koro-sensei for having supposedly killed her sister. Knowing that the experimental tentacles she wears is taxing her life force, Nagisa Shiota manages to calm her down. He distracts her with a kiss and disables the tentacles.
Koro-sensei then tells the class about his past: as a human, he was an assassin known as ""the Reaper"". Due to his strength and intelligence, two years ago, a rogue organization led by Dr. Kōtarō Yanagisawa took him as a second guinea pig (a mouse being used as the first) for the testing of a chemical capable of stimulating growth in plants. The Reaper was supervised by Yanagisawa's fiancée, Aguri, with whom he developed a close relationship, especially after she revealed her circumstances as a teacher. When Yanagisawa found out that the mouse tested on the Moon had destroyed it, he ordered the disposal of the Reaper before he could do the same to the Earth. Aguri prevented the execution but was mortally injured and died in the Reaper's arms; this action pulled the Reaper from succumbing to the madness his experimentation caused, leading him to make a vow to teach Class 3-E.
Nagisa decides to find an alternative besides killing Koro-sensei after hearing the story. Having to deal with several opponents, Karma Akabane included, on the plan, he compromises it by saying that should the plan fail, he will kill Koro-sensei himself. The class begin to work on an antidote mapped by a file Nagisa, Karma and Itona steal from Yanagisawa's labs. However, the government has planned to use a laser ignited by a satellite as a last resort to kill Koro-sensei. The government agents kidnap the class, but they manage to escape with the help of Karasuma and Irina Jelavić.
However, to their dismay, the class find out that they have been tricked by Yanagisawa, as the stolen file was faked. Yanagisawa proceeds to inject artificial tentacles, transforming himself into a monstrous being. Seeing him easily defeating Koro-sensei, Akari attempts to defend him, only to get injured in the process. Angered of having to see a repeat of the tragedy two years before, Koro-sensei creates a bomb that obliterates Yanagisawa. He does a surgery that heals Akari, having developed it since his failure in saving Aguri, then tells the class that they should kill him soon. In tears, Nagisa volunteers for the task.
Several years later, Nagisa has become a teacher in a school for delinquents. A delinquent tries to intimidate him, which Nagisa responds by silently threatening him."

Yuya Kazami, an officer of the Public Security Bureau, catches her red handed and Curaçao is forced to run away.

After noticing Curaçao's perfect aiming skills while playing darts and her swift act of saving Genta from falling from high a place, Haibara and Conan notice that Curaçao is not an ordinary woman, and Haibara herself gets a sense that Curaçao is likely to be another Black Organization agent.

The Black Organization attempts to detonate the bomb planted at the ferris wheel, but the bomb is disarmed by Rei after he is informed of its existence through Conan. The organization then change plans and instead fire from the V-22, trying to kill Curaçao and destabilize the wheel so that it will fall and roll. Akai, with the help of Conan and Rei, are able to shoot down the V-22, and Conan attempts to stop the rolling wheel before it crushes to the aquarium. Curaçao, having noticed that the Detective Boys are in the rolling ferris wheel, crash a crane truck into the wheel, stopping it and saving the Detective Boys but her actions cause the ferris wheel to crush her to death. Before her death, Curaçao admits to Vermouth that the mail tampered by Conan and sent from her broken cell phone that reads ""Bourbon and Kir are clean"" was sent on her own; thus the two are able to maintain their cover in the Black Organization."
Crayon Shin-chan: Fast Asleep! The Great Assault on Dreamy World!,"One night, the Nohara family were enjoying a pleasant dream, when suddenly a big fish appeared in their dreams and ate them. The next morning, Hiroshi read in the newspaper that everybody in another town had the same nightmare as him, but it seemed to have ended. But Hiroshi also heard the same dream from Misae, Shinnosuke, Himawari and even Shiro. They were surprised and thought if the same thing is happening in Kasukabe too. In kindergarten, on telling others about his nightmare, Shinnosuke was surprised to know that everybody too had the same dream.
Then a mysterious girl named Saki was transferred to Futaba Kindergarten and joined Shinnosuke's class. Everyone in the class, including the rather inactive Bo-chan, were all excited and happy on seeing her. But Saki had a cold attitude and didn't get along well.
That night, Shinnosuke and others were taken to a fantasy dreaming world (called Yumemi-World). Shinnosuke could see all the Kasukabe Defense Group members. They were riding on big balls. Whatever they wished was granted. When Masao said that he wanted to be a manga-artist, the ball grew bigger and he was transformed into a manga artist. Kazama was a TV announcer and Nene was an actress and a singer. Shinnosuke wished for chocobi and sweets which was instantly granted. Then he wished to play with young attractive girls in swimsuits and was taken to a beach-like area where he could do all sorts of enjoyment.
While the kids had good dreams, Hiroshi, Misae and other adults too had nice dreams, but their dream was soon converted into nightmares. The dreaming power of children is big while that of adults is small. Adults were losing dreaming energy faster than the kids. When the dreaming power of kids was consumed, they too started having nightmares. The kids became disheartened and depressed when their dreams couldn't be fulfilled completely. Masao on losing all his manga started crying.
The next day, the Kasukabe Defense Group held a meeting and decided to solve this problem of nightmares. Meanwhile, they were gradually befriending Saki. Then they asked Saki to join their group, to which she agreed. While Kazama was worrying about the cause of such nightmares, he came to realise that while everyone was having the same dream, Saki was not present. He also recalled that their dreams were being suck and converted into nightmares. Kazama gradually started to suspect that Saki and her family are the ones who are sucking up their good dreams.
Kazama went to Saki and questioned her about this. Shinnosuke told not to accuse Saki. But Saki finally decided to reveal the truth.
Saki had lost her mother in an accident when she was small. Her mother in order to protect Saki had sacrificed her life. Considering her mother's death to be her fault, Saki started having nightmares fearing that her mother is having a grudge against her. Saki's father, Nubatama Yumehiko, was worried about Saki and created a psychological magical world called the Yumemi-world. To protect her from having nightmares, he absorbed all the good dreams from others and poured it into Saki's dream world so that she could have happy dreams. As a result, others' dream energy was sucked and they all started having nightmares.
Despite knowing all this, Saki said that she didn't want to upset her father and so she neither said anything to him or to others.
In the Yumemi-world, Saki always had a stuffed toy baku(tapir) which ate all her nightmares. In Japanese mythology, the tapir (called ""Baku"") is a spirit that devours dreams and nightmares. Shinnosuke said that Baku must be existing somewhere and decided to find it together, but could not see it anywhere.
Meanwhile, Saki's father came to know about this and worrying about Saki, he interfered in their plan. Hiroshi and Misae too came to know about their plan. They said that children are pure in heart and adults shouldn't play with their feelings. They along with other adults decided to help the kids. In the dream, a grey old female monster appeared suddenly and swallowed Saki. Saki cried for her mother. Just then, the Yumemi-world broke and everybody woke up. But Saki was still in her dreams. So Shinnnosuke and the kids again slept, this time forming a circle around Saki and went into her dream.
In Saki's dream, the monster was powerful. They fought with the monster. Shinnosuke transformed to a tapir, Nene to a crab, Kazama to an airplane, Bo-chan to a rock and Masao used a pen as a sword, but they couldn’t win. Shinnosuke being a tapir ate Saki's nightmare, but the nightmare was born again. Just then, little Saki, around the age when her mother had died, appeared and said to Saki, ""Mom died because of you. She won’t forgive you. You can’t escape from nightmares.""
Seeing the children sleeping in torment, Misae couldn't resist and decided to go into their dream. Misae said that, ""There is no such parent who doesn't care about their children. It is the duty of every parent to protect their children during trouble. For a parent, children are more important than themselves. Even if a mother hates her child for some reason, still the child is much precious than her own self."" Misae being a mother herself fought the monster bravely and is able to defeat it.
Misae then embraced Saki explaining that parents never have a grudge against their children. She apologized for making her face sad and told that she is her dream and her smile is their power. Saki was able to accept her mother's death and was able to destroy the nightmare.
Then little Saki appeared again and asked if she was going to disappear. Saki said that since she was fine, little Saki can be inside her. So they two get unified into one. Seeing the nightmare getting disappeared, Kazama asked whether it was all over. Saki replied that it was still left but she is going to live better than before.
In order to prevent others from getting further nighmares, Saki's father along with Saki moved to overseas. Everybody returned to their normal lifestyles. Later Shinnosuke and others received an overseas letter from Saki saying that she wants to meet them in her dreams. In the Kasukabe Defense Group meeting, they decided to meet Saki in their dream world and slept together that night in excitement."

The story begins when Natsuki Enomoto confesses to her childhood friend Yu Setoguchi. The movie cuts to its opening, Blooming into the Color of Love (""Koi-iro ni Sake""). After the opening, an embarrassed Natsuki denies her love for Yu and calls it a ""practice confession."" The next day Natsuki is confronted by her friends, Akari Hayasaka and Mio Aida, and admits her failed confession. Her friends cheer her on and discuss Mio's love life; Mio has feelings for her close friend Haruki Serizawa. Although Mio and Natsuki are having problems confessing their love, Akari remains untroubled by the possibility of unrequited love. However, she is the main focus of a boy in her class named Sota Mochizuki, who has been in love with her since the opening ceremony of school. Sota, nicknamed Mochita by his friends, has never talked to Akari and constantly has conversations with his devilish conscience about whether to confess his love. As Sota is feeling alone in his battle to tell Akari, he notices that one of his classmates, Koyuki Ayase, is secretly in love with Natsuki. Koyuki has changed his look, no longer wearing glasses and having cut his hair.
After school, Natsuki goes over to Yu's house and plays videos game with his sister, Hina Setoguchi. When Yu arrives home they begin studying and Natsuki asks Yu what he would do if she got a boyfriend. He responds he would support her, even though he is secretly in love with her. The next day Sota musters up the courage to say good morning to Akari and tells her about her bedhead, making it the first time they have spoken to one another. She tells him it is their little secret and he falls in love with her more, pondering who she could like. At lunch, Natsuki, Mio, and Akari are talking about their guy troubles when Koyuki gives Natsuki tickets to a HoneyWorks concert. Ecstatic, she accepts and chases after him to ask him questions about merchandise while her friends question if the concert is a date or not. After school, Natsuki decides not to hangout with Yu and instead picks out her outfit for the concert. Natsuki's brother, Kotaro Enomoto, asks about Hina, whom he likes, and Natsuki teases him which results in bickering between them. The scene shifts to Yu's home where he is eating dinner with Hina. Hina comments on Kotaro's temper and how he will never get a girlfriend.
The next morning Yu is returning a DVD to Natsuki and learns about her concert date with Koyuki. The two fight about her outfit, but are actually fighting about their relationship. Natsuki goes to the concert and has a great time until one of the songs (Diagnosis: Lovesickness (""Byoumei Koi Wazura"")) makes her realize she is in love with Yu. Koyuki walks her home and notices Natsuki looking at Yu's house. Thinking about Natsuki and Yu's previous fight, Koyuki hugs Natsuki and tries to confess, saying he would not make her sad like Yu had. Koyuki is interrupted by Yu and the two argue about their hidden feelings in front of Natsuki, who begins to cry. Yu ends the conversation by leading Natsuki home. That night, Yu tries but fails to text Natsuki about his feelings. The next morning before school, the two pretend as if nothing has happened and walk together. Once at school, Koyuki apologizes to Natsuki.
On a train to school, Sota, still thinking over Akari, sees a trio of students from another school and gives up his seat to one of them and heads over to the next train car. Akari, riding in the same train, notices his act of kindness. Later during lunch, Sota gets motivation from Koyuki and musters his courage to confess his love to Akari; she accepts his confession and they walk to a cake shop after school.
Meanwhile, Haruki gets advice from their teacher, Mr. Akechi, about his feelings for Mio. Natsuki recalls a memory of witnessing a first year student delivering an unsuccessful confession to Yu. Troubled, Natsuki goes to Mio for advice. Afterwards, she musters her own personal courage and tells Yu to wait for her. The next day after school, she gathers her courage and confesses, but Yu still thinks that he was not the one she loves. He tells her she passed her confession rehearsal and wishes her luck in the real one. As he is about to leave, he is confronted by a crying Natsuki who finally tells him that the practice was a lie and her confessions were actually real. Yu embraces her, telling her that he accepts her feelings. The ending credits, Our Fraction of a Second (""Ippun Ichibyou Kimi to Boku no""), plays.
In the mid credits, Koyuki silently congratulates Natsuki in the background for finally confessing to Yu and getting accepted. Meanwhile, Hina is seen standing at the school lockers holding a letter, possibly a love letter that was meant for someone. After the credits, Natsuki barges into Yu's bedroom and wakes him, questioning his feelings for her since he didn't explicitly say that he loves her. After much pestering, Yu admits that he loves her. Natsuki is flustered and scolds him for saying it so abruptly, but happily hugs him."
Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions,"In the opening, KaibaCorp is doing research on the Millennium Puzzle. Suddenly, a mysterious cloaked man is at the underground as one of Kaiba's bodyguards tells him that he is behind schedule and to speed up his progress and they will find someone who could. A year after the departure of the Pharaoh, Yugi Muto and his closest friends are in their final year of High School and are talking about what they will do in the future. Meanwhile, Seto Kaiba has commissioned an excavation to retrieve the disassembled Millennium Puzzle from the ruins of the Millennium chamber. The item had previously housed the soul of his rival, Atem, whom he hopes to revive in order to settle their score. The excavation is interrupted by Diva, who faces Kaiba in a game of Duel Monsters and steals two pieces of the recovered Puzzle. He keeps one fragment and gives the other to his sister Sera who passes it on to Yugi Muto, aware that he was the host of the Pharaoh.
Diva, under the alias ""Aigami,"" forges a ""friendship"" with Yugi and the rest of his friends. He takes interest in Yugi's friend Ryo Bakura, whom he believes is responsible for the death of his father-like mentor, Shadi. Using his Quantum Cube, he transports Bakura and Jonouchi to another dimension. Bakura apologizes and explains that the evil spirit of the Millennium Ring had been responsible.

He abducts Diva and approaches Yugi, so he can have the two take part in the showcasing of his updated Duel Disk virtual reality technology. He intends to duel, both Diva and Yugi, while gambling their pieces of the puzzle. However, Yugi is furious with Diva over what he did to Bakura and insists he duel him instead, which Kaiba agrees to.
Yugi defeats Diva, resulting in Bakura's return to reality, and while dueling Kaiba, Yugi re-completes the Millennium Puzzle to demonstrate that the spirit of Atem is no longer inside it.

Terra Formars and Nicholas and Gordon’s Stranger Corps: The Fake Wave,"In the 21st century, overpopulation has become such a problem that scientists begin preparing for the colonization of Mars. Their first steps in the terraforming of Mars involve seeding the planet with moss in order to absorb the sunlight and create a hospitable atmosphere as well as increase the surface temperature. They also introduce cockroaches in order to spread the moss.
500 years later, in the year 2599, a manned mission is sent to the red planet to clear out the cockroach colony in preparation for the human colonization of Mars. The crew is an international team of misfits and criminals who are given the opportunity to take part in the mission to gain forgiveness for their crimes.
They enter the new atmosphere aboard the BUGS 2 and find the terraforming to have been successful. They release a roach bomb but when they walk onto the surface they do not find any dead roaches among the moss. Eventually they come upon human-sized anthropomorphic cockroaches wielding clubs that quickly kill two of the humans with their superior speed and physical strength. They determine that these creatures are the result of the accelerated evolution of the original small roaches sent by humans to aid in the terraforming efforts 500 years earlier.
In order to combat the creatures the team is given a range of specially concocted DNA infusions individually designed to give each member of the team special powers. God Lee is eager to accept the infusion, believing that his powers will also give him added bargaining power when he returns to Earth. He walks on the surface of Mars and injects the DNA when he encounters a giant cockroach, transforming into a miidera beetle (Pheropsophus jessoensis) with the power to emit fire. The cockroach survives the fire blast and kills God Lee.
A giant cockroach climbs on top of the spacecraft breaks through its transparent shell, killing two members of the team as it falls. Captain Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a bullet ant (Paraponera clavata) with the power to lift one hundred times his own weight and kills the giant cockroach.
Dozens of giant cockroaches swarm into the spacecraft as an expedition team prepares to venture out to grab parts from the BUGS 1, the vessel from the previous mission 10 years earlier, to get the current vessel BUGS 2 into shape to return to Earth. Tezuka injects the DNA and transforms into a Steninae MacLeay then sits on the back of the Mars rover and blows a jet of fire out to propel it across the terrain and kill giant cockroaches at the same time. The captain and Ichiro remain behind to battle the swarm of giant cockroaches. Ichiro injects the DNA and transforms into a sleeping chironomid (Polypedilum vanderplanki) then removes the oxygen from the vessel to cause the cockroaches to die of asphyxiation.
The expedition team encounters a wave of giant cockroaches but they push through it. A second larger wave approaches and the team fears that Tezuka will not be able to survive this one so Osako volunteers to go out to help him. She injects the DNA and transforms into a black weevil Pachyrhynchus infernalis, an insect strong enough to survive being stepped on by an elephant. Mary joins her, injecting the DNA to become a rainbow stag beetle Phalacrognathus muelleri with optical camouflage capabilities. They protect Tezuka as he propels the rover through the second wave. The three are thrown from the vehicle and killed by the giant cockroaches as the rover rolls over and enters into autopilot mode to continue its journey.
The remaining members discover and enter the BUGS 1. They find that it was already attempting to send something back to Earth. Outside two more members of the team are shot by giant cockroaches wielding large firearms. It is revealed that Ko Honda, the person who sent the team on this mission, is in communication with the giant cockroaches, who appear to have human intelligence. Keisuke Dojima injects the DNA and transforms into a deadly Asian giant hornet while Jim Muto injects the DNA and transforms into a desert locust with flying and powerful kicking and jumping abilities. Zhang Ming-Ming injects the DNA and transforms into an orchid mantis, a carnivorous insect. They then discover giant pyramids on the surface of Mars.
Asuka Moriki appears alive aboard the BUGS 2 and transformed into an emerald cockroach wasp, capable of entering the bodies of giant cockroaches and manipulating them. She revives Ichiro with water and they launch the BUGS 2 back toward Earth with a giant cockroach egg on board. The egg hatches and the giant cockroaches inside resist Asuka's manipulation and kill her.
Surprised at the new evolutionary advantage of the giant cockroaches, Ko Honda commands the BUGS 2 to fall back to the surface of Mars. The cockroaches aboard the BUGS 2 call for the assistance of the cockroaches on the surface, who sprout wings and ascend into the sky to soften the landing of the BUGS 2.
Back on the surface they face the remaining members of the human expedition team, all of whom inject another dose of DNA to transform and do battle with the hordes of cockroaches. Over the course of the battle they discover that taking a second dose will create an enhanced transformation with increased powers. Jim injects a third time, causing irreversible transformation. Shokichi attempts to defend him and is injured.
Nanao appears, transformed into a silk moth, and spreads her dust over the cockroach horde. A cockroach fires a weapon at her, causing an explosion that destroys the cockroach horde as well as Nanao. Jim and Shokichi escape the explosion and fly away, only to fall back to the surface where Jim dies in his permanent insect form. Shokichi boards the BUGS 2 again and confronts Ichiro, who saves him from a cockroach attack then suggests that they return to Earth quickly on a two-person spacecraft. As they blast off the cockroaches decide against flying after them.
Back on Earth, Sakakibara fears what the reaction will be when Earth learns of their actions. Ko Honda admits that it would be their downfall and suggests preventing the vessel from returning to Earth and then disappearing from Japanese society. She attempts to shoot him but he stops the bullet and tosses a spider at her which releases a toxic purple spray and kills her.
The film ends with Ichiro and Shokichi in the small vessel discussing their plans for the future. Shokichi plans to build graveyards for Nanao and every member. Besides, he decides to return to Mars."

Sadako vs. Kayako,"A social worker visits the residence of an elderly woman, only to find her strangled by an electric cord. A nearby video player suddenly plays the footage of the infamous cursed videotape. As the social worker watches, Sadako Yamamura manifests behind her. The social worker is eventually killed with a knife slitting her throat.
The video player is later sold at a shop and eventually bought by university students Yuri Kurahashi and Natsumi Ueno, who want to use it to burn a copy of Natsumi's parents' wedding tape onto a DVD. When they find the cursed videotape inside the player, a curious Yuri plays it. Yuri is then distracted by her phone, so she ends up not watching the footage – only a horrified Natsumi does. Meanwhile, a part-time worker in the shop where the two students purchased the video player informs the owners of the shop that she had watched the cursed videotape. The part-timer worker walks upstairs and suddenly falls off the upper level to her death. The girls decide to return the video player to the shop, where they also learn about the recent deaths related to the cursed videotape.
Desperate, the girls go to Morishige, their professor and an author on urban legends. Obsessed with the idea of meeting Sadako, Morishige eagerly watches the cursed videotape, although the girls are less than thrilled, as Natsumi only has one day to live. Morishige takes the girls to an exorcist in the hopes that she can save Natsumi. However, Sadako possesses Natsumi and forces Morishige, the exorcist and her two assistants to kill themselves for interfering. In her dying breath, the exorcist tells the girls that a man with psychic powers, Keizo Tokiwa, is on his way to help them.
When a despondent Natsumi blames Yuri for her situation, Yuri watches the tape, hoping that this will pass the curse on to her and Natsumi will be spared. However, Keizo arrives, accompanied by a blind psychic girl, Tamao, who tells Yuri that she has just unnecessarily cursed herself. The only way to permanently expunge the curse is to pit Sadako against another vengeful spirit so both obliterate each other. As Yuri hears that Natsumi has uploaded the cursed tape onto the Internet, Natsumi tries to commit suicide to escape her imminent death. Whilst Yuri rushes to save Natsumi, Sadako appears before Natsumi and kills her via hanging. Keizo and Tamao target Kayako Saeki to be the rival spirit.
Meanwhile, high school student Suzuka Takagi starts having dreams of the haunted Saeki house after moving in nearby with her family. She later runs into Keizo and Tamao, who states that the house beckons to Suzuka. Keizo warns her not to enter or she will be killed. After Suzuka leaves, a group of bullies arrive and force a schoolboy to enter the Saeki house. However, Kayako and Toshio violently drag all of them to their demise, including the schoolboy. That night, Suzuka thinks she sees someone inside the Saeki house and goes inside herself. She sees Toshio and her screams prompted her parents to rush in, but Kayako and Toshio kill them both. Keizo saves Suzuka, although she is already cursed. Yuri and Suzuka team up for Keizo's plan, where they enter the Saeki house so that Suzuka can watch the cursed videotape inside and Yuri can see Kayako, thus becoming afflicted with both curses. Keizo hopes this will make Sadako and Kayako fight over the girls and obliterate each other in the process. As the plan unfolds, Toshio appears, but Sadako drags him inside the TV with her hair. Sadako crawls out of the TV whilst Kayako crawls downstairs, prompting them to brutally confront each other, which ultimately ends in a stalemate. Keizo orders Yuri and Suzuka to flee, upon realizing that his plan failed.
Keizo reveals his last resort: one of the girls has to lure both ghosts into the well so they can be sealed inside. Yuri chooses to sacrifice herself, jumping into the well as Sadako and Kayako rush towards her, resulting in a collision that instantly bisects Keizo and forms a contorting mass of flesh. The mass enters the well and possesses Yuri. Suzuka seals the well and seemingly imprisons the mass for good. This last resort does not work either: Yuri, who has Sadako's appearance, crawls out, emitting Kayako’s death rattle; both Sadako and Kayako's curses have combined, and become a single entity – Sadakaya. Sadakaya approaches a screaming Suzuka while Toshio appears behind Tamao. Their fates are left unknown.
In a post-credits scene, Sadakaya is shown in the videotape footage, which is now set in Kayako's house instead of using the well as a backdrop. Now croaking and body contorting as she moves toward the screen, she enters through the doorway at the very back before teleporting to the front of the screen and shrieking."

He is confronted by the spirits of the past kings of Lucis; initially rejected due to being not of their bloodline, his resolve and the threat to the Crystal persuade them to allow his use of their power at the cost of his life. After fending off Glauca, Nyx returns the Ring to Lunafreya before entrusting her to Libertus, telling them to flee. With the Ring's borrowed power he engages Glauca in a titanic battle throughout Insomnia, animating the city's statues of past rulers, known as the ""Old Wall,"" to combat Niflheim's Daemons. Their fight ends as dawn approaches, with Nyx mortally wounding Glauca; Nyx dies shortly after as payment for using the Ring's power, wishing for Noctis to rule well in the future. In the aftermath, Libertus escorts Lunafreya out of the city, but she tells him to stay behind. Lunafreya then leaves with the Ring to find Noctis.

With Zoro as his prisoner, Tesoro gives the Straw Hats a chance to repay their debt by 12:00 the next night, threatening to execute Zoro otherwise.
The Straw Hats go outside and encounter Carina, whom Nami knew from the past. They eat at a diner with Carina, who reveals that Tesoro possesses 20% of the world's wealth, which he keeps in a suite area near the top of the hotel. She offers to help the Straw Hats break into the hotel and steal the money in order to repay their debt, and they accept. The next night, the Straw Hats don disguises and prepare to enter the hotel. Carina then lays out her plan: Team A, Luffy and Franky, will scale the hotel exterior and go to a room containing the Host Den Den Mushi. By disconnecting it from the Eizo Den Den Mushi, which act as security cameras in the hotel, Team B, the rest of them, can enter the hotel and reach the suite undetected. The two teams then split up, managing to successfully infiltrate the hotel and get past security. However, when Luffy infiltrates the Host Den Den Mushi room, he is spotted by security, and Tesoro and Tanaka come into the room. Tesoro overpowers Luffy and Franky, encasing Luffy's arms in gold, and Tanaka sends them into a large pit with his Devil Fruit powers. Tesoro deduces Team B's location, and sends security guards after them, forcing Team B to run back to where they came from.
Luffy and Franky fall into a giant gold cavern that has many golden objects inside it. They encounter several prisoners who have access to all this gold, but have no food, water, or way of escape. One of the prisoners, a legendary gambler and a member of the Revolutionary Army named Raise Max, tells the two that the only way to free Luffy's arms from their gold encasement is to enter a dangerous pipe system and travel to a room with a seawater pipeline. Luffy and Franky decide to go there, and Max and the prisoners come with them. They come to a vertical pipe that has a giant and fast fan spinning underneath them, and Luffy is quickly batted away by the fan when he jumps into it. However, after seeing Luffy's determination, Max jumps into the fan and uses all his strength to stop it, allowing them to get to the seawater pipeline. Meanwhile, Team B is forced to hide, but when they see a group of Celestial Dragons walking by, they steal the Dragons' clothes and resume their journey to the suite in their new disguises. However, when they open the door to the suite, they find themselves in the middle of an entertainment venue filled with a lot of people. Tesoro reveals that he had Carina lead them into this trap, and captures the Straw Hats. He then reveals that he knows Luffy's and Franky's location, and sends seawater flooding in the room, causing Luffy, Franky, and the prisoners to be submerged.
However, as Tesoro prepares to execute Zoro, seawater sprays out of Gran Tesoro's fountains instead of the usual liquid gold. The Straw Hats then reveal that it was actually they and Carina who tricked Tesoro, as their real plan had actually been to flood Gran Tesoro with seawater, which would wash all the gold dust off everyone and free them from Tesoro's control. Luffy and Franky then emerge from the fountains, and the other Straw Hats are freed from their gold bindings. Tesoro enters a rage and blows up the hotel, sending a deluge of gold on the Straw Hats and Carina. However, the Straw Hats manage to get to safety, but are confronted by Tesoro, who is inhabiting a giant gold golem, as well as his executives, who are now equipped with golden armor and weapons. Luffy attacks Tesoro, but is easily overpowered by Tesoro's golem. A Marine fleet then arrives to attack Gran Tesoro, but their commander Rob Lucci is intercepted by Sabo, and the two battle. Meanwhile, Luffy is caught by CP-0 officer Spandam and is nearly killed, but a young boy named Rikka intercepts Spandam's strike, allowing Luffy to free himself and defeat Spandam. Tesoro's executives attack the Straw Hats, but the Straw Hats eventually manage to counteract their abilities, with Sanji and Robin defeating Tanaka, Usopp defeating Baccarat, and Zoro defeating Dice. Tesoro attempts to kill Nami and Carina for revenge, but Luffy saves them and reenters the battle, in which he enters Gear Fourth and overpowers Tesoro, knocking his golem to the ground. Tesoro then liquefies his golem and sends it down on everyone in Gran Tesoro, causing them to sink in liquid gold. Tesoro stands on a mountain of gold and declares himself a god, and as Luffy charges at him in the air, he sends a massive golden tendril to finish him off. However, Luffy manages to break through the tendril and unleash a finishing blow on Tesoro, sending him flying to the Marine fleet, where he is arrested.
As the people of Gran Tesoro celebrate their liberation, a timer suddenly appears all across the city, and Carina says that once it reaches zero, the ship will explode. However, she states her intention to steer the ship away and prevent casualties, and as everyone evacuates, she and Nami embrace. The Straw Hats return to their ship, but when the timer reaches zero, nothing happens. They then see Carina standing atop Gran Tesoro, having taken control of it with her ruse. However, the Straw Hats have no hard feelings about being tricked as they are forced to flee from the attacking Marine fleet."
Shin Godzilla,"When the Japan Coast Guard investigates an abandoned yacht in Tokyo Bay, their boat is destroyed and the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is flooded. After seeing a viral video of the incident, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Rando Yaguchi theorizes that it was caused by a living creature. His theory is confirmed when news reports show a massive tail emerging from the ocean. The Prime Minister assures the public that the creature is unable to come onto land due to its weight, but it moves inland via rivers and makes landfall. It moves through the city, leaving a path of destruction and numerous civilian casualties. It evolves into a red-skinned form that can stand upright on its hind legs, and returns to the sea.
The government officials focus on military strategy and civilian safety, while Yaguchi is put in charge of a task force to research the creature. Due to high radiation readings, the group theorizes that it is energized by nuclear fission. The U.S. sends a special envoy, Kayoko Anne Patterson, who reveals that a disgraced, vehemently anti-nuclear zoology professor, Goro Maki, had been studying mutations caused by radioactive contamination and theorized the appearance of the creature, but the U.S. covered it up. The abandoned yacht belonged to Maki and he left his research notes there before disappearing.
The creature, named Godzilla after Maki's research, reappears, now twice its original size, and makes landfall near Kamakura en route for Tokyo. The Japan Self-Defense Forces mobilize, but their attacks have no effect and they are forced to withdraw to protect civilians. The U.S. intervenes based on defending their embassy, prompting the evacuation of civilians and government officials. U.S. B-2 bombers bombard Godzilla; Godzilla responds with highly destructive atomic rays fired from its mouth and dorsal fins, which hit and destroy the helicopter carrying the top government officials. The battle leaves radiation fallout and destruction in a huge part of Tokyo. After depleting its energy, Godzilla enters a dormant state and becomes immobile.
Yaguchi's team discovers that Godzilla's fins and blood work as a cooling system and theorize that they could use a coagulating agent to freeze it. After analyzing tissue samples, they find that Godzilla is an ever-evolving creature, able to reproduce asexually. The United Nations, aware of this, informs Japan that they will allow the use of thermonuclear weapons against Godzilla. Evacuations are ordered in multiple prefectures. Unwilling to see nuclear weapons detonated in Japan again, Patterson decides to use her political connections to buy time for Yaguchi's team, who the interim government has little faith in. Yaguchi's team has a breakthrough and procure the means to conduct their deep freeze plan through international cooperation.
Hours before the planned nuclear attack, Japan enacts the deep freeze plan. Godzilla is provoked into using its atomic breath with a large number of drones until it depletes. The team then detonates explosives in nearby buildings, knocking Godzilla down and giving the tankers full of coagulant access to inject it into Godzilla's mouth. Though many people are killed in the process, Godzilla is frozen solid. In the aftermath, it is discovered that the Godzilla fallout has a very short half-life and that Tokyo can be reconstructed. The international community agrees to cancel the strike but has the new Japanese government agree that, in the event of Godzilla's reawakening, an immediate thermonuclear strike will be executed. Godzilla's tail shows humanoid Godzilla-like creatures frozen in the middle of emerging."

Kizumonogatari Part 2: Nekketsu,"Koyomi Araragi, a second year high school student at Naoetsu High School, befriends Tsubasa Hanekawa, the top honors student at his school. Tsubasa mentions a rumor about a “blonde vampire” that has been sighted around their town recently. Koyomi, who is usually anti-social, takes a liking to Tsubasa’s down-to-earth personality. That evening, Koyomi encounters this rumored vampire: she is Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, also known as the “King of Apparitions.” The blonde, golden-eyed vampire cries out for Koyomi to save her as she lies in a pool of her own blood, all four of her limbs having been cut off by three vampire hunters. Kiss-shot asks Koyomi to give her his blood in order to save her life, and when he does, Koyomi finds himself reborn as her vampire subordinate.
Now a vampire, Koyomi is charged with retrieving Kiss-shot's severed limbs from the vampire hunters who took them. Before he confronts the first hunter, the gigantic full-vampire Dramaturgy, he has a conversation with Tsubasa. He hides his vampire nature, but Tsubasa is still interested in the rumors about vampires being spread around. At the fight, Dramaturgy tears Koyomi's arms off in one blow, but Koyomi discovers his vampire power of rapid regeneration. Seeing the fight as lost, Dramaturgy surrenders Kiss-shot's leg to Koyomi. At the time, Kiss-shot has taken the form of a child. But she morphs into a young teenager after she consumes her adult leg.
Koyomi next fights the vampire-human half-breed Episode, who can transform into mist and wields a giant silver cross as a weapon. Tsubasa walks into the fight and is disemboweled by Episode. Before she dies, Tsubasa points out to Koyomi that he can defeat Episode by throwing sand into his mist form. Koyomi uses sand to overwhelm Episode and beats Episode savagely. Meme Oshino, an ally of Kiss-shot, gets Koyomi to calm down and, for a price of ¥3 million, informs Koyomi that he can use his own blood to heal Tsubasa. Koyomi then uses his own blood to save Tsubasa's life. Consumption of the second leg enables Kiss-shot to morph into a young adult.
Koyomi now must face the fully human priest Guillotine Cutter for Kiss-shot's arms. Before the fight, he desperately pleads with Tsubasa to leave for her own safety. Tsubasa ultimately agrees, leaving her panties with Koyomi as a promise that they will reunite later. Nonetheless, Guillotine Cutter kidnaps Tsubasa, and Meme advises that Koyomi must ""forget about being human again"" in order to rescue her. Koyomi uses a power to transform his arms into tree roots to defeat Guillotine Cutter and save Tsubasa, but appears to have abandoned his wish to become human again.
Koyomi and Meme finally succeed at fully restoring Kiss-shot. Koyomi expects Kiss-Shot to then change him back to human. But before that, Kiss-shot and Koyomi spend an evening on a rooftop, where Kiss-shot reminisces about her previous subordinate, a Samurai who chose to commit suicide when Kiss-shot was not able to restore his humanity. Koyomi goes off to buy food, but when he returns he finds Kiss-shot eating the eviscerated corpse of Guillotine Cutter. He is horrified at the realization that Kiss-Shot will now hunt humans again, and that he himself will want to hunt as well.
The realization leaves Koyomi despondent enough to want to die. But then Tsubasa appears and persuades Koyomi to stay alive. She also points out that Koyomi himself has the power to stop Kiss-shot. Tsubasa's comforting words, as well as a clumsy attempt to fondle her breasts, bring Koyomi's spirits up enough to face Kiss-shot in a fight.
Kiss-shot and Koyomi face off in the Tokyo Olympic stadium. They repeatedly tear each other's limbs and heads off, but then regenerate their appendages back. Finally, Koyomi weakens Kiss-shot by sucking out her blood. But Tsubasa suddenly realizes that Kiss-shot wants to die. Kiss-shot admits that she was going to throw the fight, and explains that she has to die to restore a subordinate's humanity, but couldn't do so for her previous subordinate because she was too scared of death. Kiss-shot demands that Koyomi kill her, but Koyomi instead yells for Meme's help. Meme proposes a solution that will ""make everyone miserable"": Koyomi will suck out Kiss-shot's blood only to the point that she is too weak to hunt humans, leaving them both quasi-versions of vampire and human. Over Kiss-shot's protestations, Koyomi chooses this path. The next day, Koyomi explains to Tsubasa that he is mostly human but does have some vampire traits. Kiss-shot now has the form of a child, and can only eat by regularly sucking Koyomi's blood."

The two make a promise that they will join the brass band and baseball clubs, respectively, and support each other for the championship.
During their first year, Tsubasa and Daisuke befriend Yasushi Kido, who also joins the baseball club, and Himari Wakita, who warns Tsubasa of the brass band's strict commitments. Indeed, Tsubasa is overwhelmed by the club's unrelenting exercises, especially as she has no experience of playing a trumpet before, while her shyness is belittled by fellow freshman Aki Mizushima, a moody but prodigious trumpeter. Nevertheless, with Daisuke's encouragement, Tsubasa holds on and slowly learns the art of a trumpeter, aided by her upperclassman, Yuka Mori. When Yuka becomes depressed after being dismissed from the national championship team due to an injury, Tsubasa stubbornly visits her apartment to ask for her return. Though the brass band ultimately fails in claiming the gold medal, Yuka does return and thanks Tsubasa for her support.

Despite this, Tsubasa is initially not chosen to play for the national championship, though she requests for additional training and is ultimately selected. She and Mizushima have become friends and are facing a group of ambitious juniors unhappy with the team's current leadership. Meanwhile, a love rival for Tsubasa appears in the form of Akane Sawa, a junior member of the baseball club insisting that Tsubasa is merely hindering Daisuke, especially when Daisuke is handicapped after a training and has little chance to apply for the regional championship. To cheer him up, Tsubasa arranges for the entire brass band club to play an orchestra in front of Daisuke's ward. Daisuke eventually recovers enough for him to participate as a replacement member.
At the regional championship, Shirato's baseball team initially loses track until Daisuke emerges to replace an exhausted batter. He is able to score a homerun at the last minute, thus winning the champion title. That afternoon, Tsubasa visits the school's hall of fame and is approached by Daisuke, who confesses his love for her. She accepts and the two kiss.
During the credits, Shirato's brass band team is shown participating in the national championship and winning the gold medal."

She begins switching bodies intermittently with Taki, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by leaving notes in Mitsuha's notebook and memos on Taki's phone, and sometimes by writing on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school.
Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the shrine on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god who rules human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about a comet expected to pass Earth on the day of her town festival.
One day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha, but cannot reach her, and the body switching ends. He decides to visit Itomori, but does not know its name, his memories of it are fading, and Mitsuha's messages have disappeared. A restaurant owner in Hida finally recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him it was destroyed by a fragment of the comet. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers the date of the disaster. He realizes their timelines were separated by three years.
Taki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's kuchikamizake, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her of the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that Mitsuha, having fallen in love with him, met his past self while trying to meet him personally. He wakes in her body on the morning of the town festival; Mitsuha's grandmother deduces his identity, and tells him the body switching is part of the Miyamizu family history as caretakers of the shrine.

He recognizes Tessie and Sayaka in a Tokyo restaurant, now engaged, but cannot identify them, and both Taki and Mitsuha's friends and family are shown to be pursuing their own paths. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on a staircase. Feeling they have met before, they simultaneously ask for each other's name."
James Black and the New Treasure and Your Lie in April,"Kosei Arima is a pianist who has won many awards and recognition due to his precision, timing, and ability to switch between tempos easily, earning him the moniker ""human metronome"". However, he came so far to his position because he was meticulously taught by his terminally ill mother, Saki, who was abusive and demanding. When, as a seven-year-old, she slapped him after a victory that she deemed unwarranted, he declared his refusal to play the piano again and wished that she died. Indeed, Saki died the following day; this caused Kosei to experience a mental breakdown, making him unable to hear sounds from the piano as well as seeing everything as black and white. Kosei subsequently quit the venue.
Sometime in April of his teenage years, Kosei is asked by his childhood friends, Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryota Watari, to go on a double date with them and Kaori Miyazono, whom Tsubaki says is attracted to Watari. Kaori, as it turns out, is a bubbly children-loving violinist. She plays the violin in an unorthodox manner, refusing to follow the cues and instead creating her own flow that nevertheless impresses the audience. One of her competitions requires that a pianist play with her, so Kaori forces Kosei to come out retirement and assist her. During the competition, Kosei experiences a breakdown again, but Kaori encourages him to restart the recital, despite the fact that it will disqualify her. He succeeds and while Kaori is disqualified, she is invited to play at a gala concert. For the gala, Kaori picks Love's Sorrow, a piece that Saki used to play as a lullaby for her son. Kosei is initially hesitant, but his mother's pianist friend, Hiroko Seto, tells him that it would be a good chance to prove to his mother what a pianist he has become.
During the concert, Kaori is unexpectedly hospitalized, so Kosei plays the piece solo. Kaori is later released and forces Kosei to ""replace"" Watari for a date the two had made, as a punishment for his not showing up for her during her hospitalization. The two visit the school that night, where Kaori reveals that she had lied about the date, as she is still hospitalized, but she does not want her illness to make her helpless. When she collapses, Kosei takes her to the hospital but otherwise is unable to say anything else. Watari correctly deduces that he is in love with her and encourages him to meet and confess to her. Meanwhile, Tsubaki anguishedly declares her own love for Kosei and reveals that she agreed to introduce Kaori because she hoped that would make Kosei turn to her. Afterwards, Kosei confesses to Kaori as the two share a meal in the rooftop, also saying that he has taken up a piano competition. Hearing his wish for her to play with him again, Kaori decides to undergo an risky operation. During the competition, Kosei is aided by an image of Kaori playing violin alongside him.
At spring of the following year, Kosei opens a letter written by Kaori, who did not survive her operation. He learns that Kaori had been admiring him since very young and decided to take violin so she could someday play with him. When she learned that her illness was terminal, she transformed her image and personality drastically. Telling him to apologize to Tsubaki and Watari in her place, she also said about her lie in the April of the previous year: when she said that she was in love with Watari, she was in fact in love with Kosei."

Shōya visits the sign language center to return Shōko's once-waterlogged notebook in the hopes of making amends. The two begin meeting at a bridge to feed bread to koi.
Yuzuru, Shōko's younger sister, strongly doubts Shōya's intentions. One day, Shōya jumps into a river after Shōko does the same to retrieve a notebook, which happens to be prohibited, and posts the photo online. Shōya is suspended for the act, and Yuzuru reveals that she was responsible; instead of getting angry, Shōya brings her to stay at his house. When she leaves in the middle of the night, Shōya follows and tells her that he is genuinely remorseful for the way he treated Shōko.
Shōko soon gives Shōya a gift and confesses her feelings for him, but because she tries to speak her affections rather than signing it out, Shōya does not understand her.

The group has a heated confrontation about each member's level of responsibility which ends with Shōya callously calling out every one of them for who they really are.
To cheer Shōko up after her grandmother's death, Shōya takes her to the countryside, where he begins to understand how much she blames herself for everything that has happened to him. Desperate to reassure and change her mindset, Shōya contrives to regularly meet with the sisters.
During the fireworks festival, Shōko goes home under the guise of finishing some schoolwork. Shōya follows when Yuzuru asks him to get her camera. When he arrives, he finds Shōko standing on the balcony, on the verge of throwing herself to her death. Shōya succeeds in grabbing her and pulls her back up, but he falls over the side into the river and slips into a coma.
One night, Shōko dreams of receiving a farewell visit from Shōya. Horrified, she runs to the bridge where they fed the koi and collapses in tears. Shōya, awakening from his coma in a state of panic, stumbles to the bridge himself and finds her there, huddled in despair. He formally apologizes to her for the way he treated her, and for the many things he did which may have caused her to hate herself. He asks her to stop blaming herself, and also admits that, while he once considered giving up himself and ending his own life, he has since decided against it. Shōya then asks her to help him continue to live.
When Shōya goes to the school festival with Shōko, he finds out how much his friends from elementary school still care for him. After returning to school, finally able look at people's faces, he realizes that he has found redemption and forgiveness at last."
Rage,A grisly unsolved murder links three seemingly unrelated stories in three different Japanese cities.
Ajin Part 3: Shōgeki,"The story is about a student named Kei Nagai (永井 圭, Nagai Kei), who discovers he is an ""immortal"" ""Ajin"" when he is hit by a truck. He is wanted by the government because the Ajin are considered dangerous inhuman beings and the only person who is there to support him is his childhood friend, Kaito. While the government claims to help Ajin live in a safe environment, they are actually using them as subjects for cruel and inhumane experimentation. As a result, Ajins that have escaped are bent on revenge – with the exception of Kei, who wants no part in the Ajin conflict. Kei is initially shown to lack empathy for others, even the people closest to him, but as Sato's actions become even more extreme, he eventually joins the fight to stop Sato's violent campaign."

GANTZ: O and Morrison Steel: The Greatest Years of My Life,"While fighting invading monsters, Kei Kurono rescues his friend, Reika. Though she protests, he attacks the monsters' leader, dying after killing it. Reika and her surviving teammates are teleported back to their base. Elsewhere, Masaru Kato dies attempting to save someone from a knife attack in a subway. He wakes up in a room with Reika and her teammates: Yoshikazu Suzuki, an old man; Joichiro Nishi, a surly teenager; and an angry, unidentified man. Suzuki explains that they have each died and woken in the room, and have been forced to fight against waves of monsters ever since. Before Suzuki can explain further, a black orb identified as ""Gantz"" announces that their next mission is about to begin. The angry man refuses to participate and is killed by Nishi, who reasons that he would have been a liability.
After putting on skintight suits containing advanced technology, the group is teleported to Osaka. When Kato presses for answers, Nishi threatens to kill him. Suzuki quickly explains the ""game"": the team is given two hours to kill every monster in the city; if they fail, the team members die. After Kato and his team meet another team, some of whom have exotic weapons, Suzuki tells him that players accrue points for killing monsters. Anyone who scores 100 points can choose from three bonuses: upgraded weaponry, resurrection of a fallen teammate, or freedom from the ""game"".
Nishi turns invisible to stealthily wait for high point monsters. The others watch as the better-equipped Osaka team easily slaughters monsters. Reika and Suzuki urge Kato to not engage the monsters needlessly, but he insists that they rescue the city's citizens. They refuse, saying they are too weak.
Anzu Yamasaki, a member of the Osaka team, follows Kato, trying to figure out his motivation. Kato says he is a student who has been living alone with his younger brother since the death of their parents. Yamasaki reveals that she has a young son and says they have something in common: both must stay alive to help someone who depends on them. Although Yamasaki initially believes that Kato is showing off, she eventually concludes that he genuinely wants to help others and joins him in killing a monster that was menacing civilians.
A gigantic monster rises from the water, and an equally large mecha appears, piloted by seven-time winner Hachiro Oka. Oka kills the monster but loses his mecha. In the mean time, another monster kills the two most competent players on the Osaka team.
Oka, wounded and weaponless, engages the lead monster, who appears in a series of increasingly deadly forms. Oka appears to win but tells the team it is not dead; it must be taken by surprise to be truly killed. After rising, the demon easily defeats the remaining players. Suzuki is heavily wounded after sacrificing himself to save Kato, and Nishi's arm is ripped off. Instead of killing them, it goes after Oka, who has left to retrieve better weapons.
Knowing someone must defeat the demon and Oka may be too wounded, Kato decides to act as a decoy while Reika and Yamasaki snipe the monster. Before the plan begins, Yamasaki proposes that, if she and Kato survive, they begin living together with her son and Kato's brother. Although surprised, Kato agrees, and they take their positions.
The demon, having killed Oka, attacks Kato, and the others shoot it from a distance. Before dying, the demon kills Yamasaki and maims Kato. Kato collapses beside Yamasaki's body, and the others assume him dead. Reika, Suzuki, and Nishi are surprised when he rejoins them at the base, where all are fully healed. When the scores are tallied up, Kato has 100 points; Reika and Suzuki encourage him to choose his freedom, but he resurrects Yamasaki. After Gantz allows them to leave, Kato races to his brother. The others reveal that this is Kato's second time in Gantz' game: after winning a previous game, he was granted his freedom and had his memories wiped. Although they do not know how he returned, they state that his self-sacrificing nature remains the same."

Her Love Boils Bathwater,"After Futaba is diagnosed with cancer, she hopes to reunite with her estranged husband and bond with their teenage daughter."
Death Note: Light Up the New World,"In 2006, Light Yagami (aka ""Kira"") battled the detective L in his attempt to rid the world of crime, aided by the power of a Death Note - a supernatural notebook that kills anyone whose name is written inside. Ten years later, in a world afflicted with cyber-terrorism, a chain of unexplained deaths suggests that Death Notes are being used once more. Interpol quickly assigns L's biological successor, Ryuzaki, to the newly established ""Death Note Task Force"", led by Detective Tsukuru Mishima. They quickly secure a notebook during a murder spree in Shibuya, after its owner, Sakura Aoi, is killed by another Death Note. Upon touching Aoi's notebook, the Task Force meets and questions its original owner - a Shinigami (""god of death"") named Beppo - who reveals that there are six Death Notes currently in the human world; this is the maximum number that can exist there at any one time. The Task Force resolves to find the remaining five Death Notes.
Similarly, Aoi's killer - cyber-terrorist Yuki Shien - vows to acquire all the notebooks, believing he is on a mission from Light via his Shinigami, Ryuk. Inciting global panic with a virus featuring a video of Light as Kira, Shien then makes contact with Light's girlfriend and former ally, Misa Amane. After restoring her memories of Death Notes and gifting her with his, Shien asks Misa to disclose information which he believes will reveal where Light is hiding; she refuses, having watched Light seemingly die ten years ago. Undaunted, Shien uses his exceptional hacking abilities to locate three Death Notes, killing their owners in the process. He then impersonates Kira via another virus, threatening a killing spree unless L's successor reveals his name and face. In response, Ryuzaki spreads a CGI video of the original L, inviting Kira to a website intended to trick him into revealing his location. Anticipating this, Shien escapes before killing one of the original Kira investigators - Touta Matsuda. Fearing that the investigation is compromised, the Japanese government dissolves the Death Note Task Force.
Refusing to give up, Mishima finds a hidden message in Ryuzaki's video: ""I own the last Death Note"". Enraged, Mishima confronts Ryuzaki in his home and discovers the latter's unconventional relationship with his Shinigami, Arma. However, Ryuzaki reveals that his Death Note is blank, having promised L before his death that he would never use one. Upon leaving, Mishima is arrested on suspicion of compromising the investigation. A year prior, Mishima was tasked with locating Hikari Yagami, Light's secret successor who was placed in the care of prosecutor Teru Mikami. However, both Yagami and Mikami subsequently vanished, leading the police to suspect Mishima of conspiring with Kira. After Mishima is interrogated, Ryuzaki frees him so that he can access the Task Force's Death Note and confront the new Kira. Agreeing to meet Ryuzaki at the National Arts Centre, Shien again asks Misa for her help, which she reluctantly gives.
After three Task Force members return to the case, they head with Ryuzaki to meet Shien, who has been lured with the promise that Ryuzaki will reveal his face and the team's Death Notes. Mishima remains at headquarters to instruct them - however, contact is cut by a jamming signal made by Shien. Forced to reveal their faces, Ryuzaki and two Task Force members are killed by Misa, who has acquired ""Shinigami Eyes"" which display a person's real name above their head. Misa then gives Shien the information he needs but warns him that Light is definitely dead; his name did not appear when she looked at her picture of him. Finally, Misa kills herself with a Death Note page.
Realising that the Kira who gave him his task is an imposter, Shien arrives at the secret location and sacrifices half of his life span to obtain Shinigami Eyes - deciding to kill the imposter and take his place as Neo Kira. Shien is then shocked to be confronted by Mishima and Ryuzaki; the latter suspects Neo Kira wrote his name much earlier and specified a later time of death. Ryuzaki then reveals that he believes Mishima is Neo Kira - and upon touching Shien's Death Note, Mishima remembers everything. Having witnessed Teru Mikami turn insane and murder Hikari Yagami, Mishima killed Mikami and replaced Yagami as Neo Kira. Mishima later gave up ownership of his notebook and instructed Ryuk to give it to Shien, confident that the cyber-terrorist would find the remaining Death Notes. With this new information, Shien attempts to kill Mishima, but the police arrive with orders to kill all three of them. Mortally wounded in the initial crossfire, Shien dies after giving Mishima the Death Notes, allowing him and Ryuzaki to escape through an abandoned subway. They are then confronted by the last remaining Task Force member, who realises that Mishima is Kira and thus the one who killed a member of her family. However, Arma kills her when she attempts to shoot Mishima - at the cost of her own life, much to Ryuzaki's despair.
Mishima and Ryuzaki's execution order is annulled by Interpol and Mishima is taken into custody. Ryuk then explains why the six Death Notes were dropped down to earth - the dying Shinigami King, intrigued by Light Yagami, has promised to give his throne to the Shinigami who finds the next Kira. When Mishima points out that all six Death Notes have been secured, Ryuk suggests that human greed will result in their use once again, and leaves. Shortly after being led to his cell, Mishima is greeted by Ryuzaki, who informs him that the vehicle containing the notebooks was attacked by a terrorist group, destroying four and leaving the other two missing. Revealing that today is his appointed date of death, Ryuzaki suggests trading places with Mishima, as he believes that the latter is the only one who can retrieve the missing Death Notes. Accepting his new role, Mishima reveals his real name - Ryo Nakagami - and leaves Ryuzaki to die peacefully in the cell.
A post-credit scene shows a video of Light saying ""Just as I planned"" and ironically smiling."
Kagerou Daze -in a day's-,"Shintarō Kisaragi is an 18-year-old hiki-NEET who has not left his room in two years, engrossing himself with his computer and the internet. However, on August 14, due to the messing about of the cyber girl Ene, who lives inside his computer, Shintarō spills soda on his computer keyboard and is forced to go outside to buy a new one, due to the fact that during the Obon festival none of the stores will deliver until August 17. Shintarō goes to the department store, where a group of criminals break in and hold the people inside hostage for ransom. Here he comes in contact with a group of teenagers calling themselves the ""Mekakushi Dan"" (メカクシ団, lit. ""Blindfold Gang""), who stop the robbery with their mysterious eye powers and force Shintarō to join into their group.
Before this occurs, Shintarō's younger sister, Momo Kisaragi, is a popular idol who has the ability to attract people's attention. This is due to the ""Drawing Eyes"" ability, which she cannot control and causes people to look at her wherever she goes. One day, while fleeing from a horde of fans, she meets the Mekakushi Dan leader, Tsubomi Kido, who invites Momo to join, which she does. While meeting the first four members of the Mekakushi Dan, Marry trips and gets Momo's phone wet, they all go to the department store to buy a new phone for Momo. Kido uses her ability to keep people from staring at Momo, but while in the store, they find out Shintarō is there at the same time. The terrorists break in and take all the shoppers hostage, but with Kido's eye power, she, Momo, Marry, Seto, and Kano are invisible and thus do not get caught. They work together to stop the heist, though Shintarō passes out, and they bring him to their hideout and introduce him and Ene as members once the former awakens. They all go to the amusement park and have fun afterwards.
The prologue is told in the second novel, -a headphone actor-. Takane Enomoto and Haruka Kokonose, students of Kenjirō Tateyama, plan a class booth for their school's cultural festival. Haruka gets an idea to host a shooting booth; however this idea could not be fulfilled due to Kenjirō spending all their booth funds on a rare specimen. Takane, being a highly skilled gamer, decides that instead of a shooting booth with a large amount of equipment, they should make a video game of a first-person shooter. Kenjirō would be in charge of programming, Haruka was in charge of illustration and Takane was responsible for playing as the opponent. Their plan captured a great amount of attention, good and bad.
The series had about 3 endings:
Bad Ending: Also known as 'Route XX'. In this route, Shintaro becomes mentally unstable in the years after Ayano's death due to his loss of her and regret of not recognising her more. Two years later, Shintaro kills Ene and himself as a result, is sent into the Heat Haze Daze. Although he is reunited with Ayano in the Daze he was unable to accept her death, so was unable to receive the Snake of Favouring Eyes from her, leading to the whole main cast's demise and the time being reversed once again by Marry,
Good Ending: Also known as 'Route 1'. In this route, Shintaro accepts Ayano's death and meets all of the Mekakushi Dan. He is killed after Black Konoha (the possessed version of Konoha) aims a gun at his own head (reasons unknown), and Shintaro then knocks Konoha aside and is fatally shot. Shintaro is then sent into the Heat Haze Daze and summarily reunited with Ayano who then gave him her power, as the requirement to receive a new life and a Snake is that a pair of people must have died on August 14/15, and one of the pair must stay in the Heat Haze Daze permanently. Ayano chooses to stay and give the new life to Shintaro, along with the Snake. Shintaro then exits the Heat Haze Daze, and the Snake of Clearing Eyes is defeated (through unknown means), allowing the cast to move on with their life.
True Ending: 'Anime only'.
Happened after Routes 1 and XX. Instead of Shintaro being killed by Black Konoha, Shintaro is reminded of his power given to him personally by Marry at the very first route after seeing a family picture of Ayano with Kido, Kano and Seto that was on a shelf at the Mekakushi Dan's hideout. This shocked him into remembering all the routes that he dreamt about were reality via his dormant Snake speaking to him. Whilst this happens, Ene regains her original body. He then commits suicide to purposefully enter the Daze to retrieve Ayano and awaken Haruka to help the Mekakushi Dan to fight against Black Konoha. Ayano and Shintaro return from the Daze, and Ayano transfers Shintaro's memories of all the routes into Marry, allowing Marry the ability to make the Snakes swallow the time line. Kenjiro declines the Snake of Clearing Eyes' services (as his wish to be with his wife Ayaka was granted with his death) and instead Konoha forces upon the Snake his last wish - for Hiyori, the pair of Hibiya in the Heat Haze Daze to be alive. As such, Hiyori receives the Snake of Clearing Eyes power, and a new life. The Snake of Clearing Eyes' consciousness then ceases to exist. Haruka regains his original body and is healed of his illness, and all the members of the Mekakushi Dan continue on their lives, vowing to make a new future."

In This Corner of the World,"A young woman named Suzu, who is innocent and loves drawing, lives in a seaside town called Eba[a] in Hiroshima City. In 1944, 18-year-old Suzu, working for her grandmother's small family business of cultivating Nori (edible sea weed), is told by her parents that an unknown young man has come to propose marriage to her. The man, whose name is Shusaku, lives in Kure City,[b] a large naval port city 15 miles away from Hiroshima City, as a navy civilian. He remembers that he and Suzu had first met during one of Suzu's childhood visits to the city. Suzu decides to marry him and moves to join Shusaku's family in Kure. As Suzu adjusts to her new life in Kure, the threat of the Pacific War slowly begins to encroach on the daily lives of the townspeople.
As food shortages become commonplace, the government implements food rationing. Warning and evacuation preparations against U.S. air raids also begin. Suzu, as a young housewife in a Tonarigumi,[c] takes turns overseeing food distribution and attends training against air raids. Like other Japanese housewives, she makes women's trousers fit for emergency evacuation by cutting traditionally designed clothing, such as kimonos, into parts. As officially allocated food becomes scarce, Suzu looks for any way to feed her family, picking edible plants and trying recommended recipes. Suzu, maintaining her cheerful character, makes efforts to improve the living conditions and to prepare for the air bombing with her family and neighbors. The family build the air-raid shelter in the garden. Her daily lives are full of humorous and lovely episodes.
The family house of Suzu & Shusaku is located on a hillside in the suburbs of Kure, with a view of the Japanese Naval Fleet in the harbor, including the largest battleships, Yamato and Musashi. Suzu enjoys touching nature and viewing boats moving on the sea with her niece, Harumi. One day, as Suzu draws pictures of floating warships, the military police accost her and come close to accusing her of espionage. In December 1944, a navy sailor named Tetsu comes to visit Suzu: he was a childhood friend of hers, and he has been assigned to the Japanese cruiser Aoba, which is stationed in Kure. Understanding it might be Suzu's last chance to see Tetsu alive, Shusaku leaves them alone to talk without a chaperone. The next spring, Shusaku is drafted by the Navy and temporarily quartered with troops in Otake City, 40 miles away from Kure.
In 1945, the U.S. begins air raids on the Japanese mainland; in Kure, U.S. naval airplanes heavily attack warships and its naval facilities. In July, urban areas of Kure are firebombed, and most of the city burns. Suzu is nearly killed by a U.S. low-level strafing run, but saved by Shusaku. Like many other Japanese, Suzu is unable to avoid tragedy; in addition to the death of her brother Yōichi, Suzu loses her niece, Harumi, and her right hand, which she describes as an ""irreplaceable"" part of her body due to its dominance, when a delay-action bomb detonates very close to them. Keiko, Harumi's mother blames Suzu for her daughter's death. As she suffers from depression, Suzu debates returning to the relative safety of her hometown (Eba) in Hiroshima City in time for the local summer festival on August 6; when she is unable to see a doctor, however, she decides to stay an extra week in Kure. On that particular morning, Suzu, still at her marriage home in Kure, notices a bizarre light and an abrupt quake from a distance. Strangely, Hiroshima Radio Station of Japan Broadcasting Corporation goes off the air, and a towering, roiling cloud rises ominously over the mountain from the direction of Hiroshima City. Soon, Suzu learns what has occurred in Hiroshima City; a new, devastating bomb has fallen on the town, destroying countless citizens and buildings in Hiroshima City. For a while, Suzu is unable to enter or get information about her hometown.
A few days later, in a radio address, the Emperor of Japan announces the end of the War. Suzu, having faced countless setbacks and tragedies during the war, and had grown accustomed to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and temporarily falls into despair. Soon, the times begin to change rapidly: US occupation forces, no longer the enemy, come to Kure and provide food for its citizens. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu,[d] a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, who took refuge from deserted Hiroshima and is the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs Suzu of the fate of their parents; Sumi herself has fallen seriously ill from the radiation left behind by the atomic‐bomb radiation. Shusaku, who returns from his naval service, meets with Suzu by chance in a deserted area of Hiroshima and tells her that he has found a new job. They come across a little girl, a war (atomic bomb) orphan struggling to survive in the ruins after losing her mother, and adopt her into their home in Kure. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits roll, their adopted daughter is shown growing up in the Hojo residence, sewing clothes with her own hands, aided by Suzu in peaceful post-war Japan."

The Fleet decides to investigate and commences an operation, consisting of 4 task forces, where the true goal was to escort Fubuki into this dark portal in the middle of the Crimson Sea, which is a source of the Abyssal Vessels' power. (This portal looks practically the same as the final map in PS VITA KanColle Kai.)
Several battles occur, where several Fleet Girls become heavily damaged from battle but no one gets sunk. When they arrive at the Dark Portal, only Yamato, Mutsuki and Fubuki remain. Yamato and Mutsuki become Heavily Damaged from battle but out of nowhere, half-transformed Abyssal Kisaragi comes to their aid, and Fubuki takes the chance to jump into the Dark Portal.
It is revealed that this area was the place where the actual IJN Destroyer Fubuki got sunk in 1942 (Cape Esperance, the infamous 'Ware-Aoba'). The secret is revealed, that when all of the Ships sunk during back in World War II, their Souls left the ships, wandering around the sea, while constantly switching back and forth from Abyssal Vessels to Fleet Girls. Fubuki meets her Dark Persona, an Abyssal Fubuki, who tries to persuade Fubuki into becoming an Abyssal Vessel. Fubuki refuses, and both go through a mental breakdown through a Mind Battle, through which Fubuki and her doppelganger become one.
Afterwards, the Dark Portal disappears, similar to when an Event map is cleared. Abyssal Vessels disappear from the area, but Abyssal Kisaragi disappears as well, after exchanging few last words with Mutsuki. Fubuki is promoted to both 11th Destroyer Division, as well as the Vanguard of the 2nd Torpedo Squadron for her efforts, but is immediately after called out for a mission, to which she promises her Dark Persona to make peace in the oceans one day.
In a post-credits scene, Mutsuki is able to reunite with Kisaragi; the movie concludes just as Mutsuki jumps to embrace her sister."

"My Tomorrow, Your Yesterday","On February 15, 20-year-old Takatoshi Minamiyama, a visual arts undergraduate and satirist in Kyoto, falls in love at first sight with Emi Fukuju while boarding a train for college. After awkwardly introducing each other, the two promise to meet again in the following days. With the help of his friend, Shoichi Ueyama, Takatoshi asks for a date with Emi, at the end of which he confesses his love for her.
Takatoshi finds Emi to be strange, being able to predict things that would happen to him, with the tendency to cry whenever he does something nice to her. She also never wants to spend time with him after midnight. After the two consummate their relationship on March 1, Takatoshi discovers Emi's journal that she purposefully left on the table. Much to his confusion, Emi wrote them as if she races through time backwards: the first page is dated March 16, and the last February 15.
The next day, Emi reveals that she is a being from a world in which time runs backwards; what humans perceive as the future she already experienced as her past, and vice versa. Emi has been watching Takatoshi from afar since he was young; she was the adult woman who rescued him from drowning at the age of 5. Because her memories of him fade as time goes on (and her time goes backwards), she keeps a journal to remind her of him. She also tells him that they can only be together for a month every five years, and because 20 is the only time their age matches, the current month is the last time where they can pursue a relationship.
Takatoshi initially feels conflicted of the fake nature of his and Emi's relationship. However, he is encouraged by Ueyama to pursue it nevertheless. On March 16, the last day they would be together as equals, Takatoshi draws a sketch of Emi, then the two wait for the day to pass at the train station where they first met, after which Emi disappears.
Five years later, Takatoshi meets with 15-year-old Emi and gives her her sketch. A further ten years later, Takatoshi rescues 5-year-old Emi from a festival fire. The film then cuts to a montage of the film presented from Emi's perspective, i.e. backwards, ending with her and Takatoshi's introduction on February 15, her last day she met him as equals."

Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress Pt.1,"A mysterious virus appears during the industrial revolution that transforms infected humans into Kabane (カバネ, ""corpses"") and rapidly spreads. Kabane are aggressive, undead creatures that cannot be defeated unless the glowing heart, which is protected by a layer of lead, is pierced, or an important body part is completely severed (such as the head). Unfortunately, most melee weapons and the steam-pressure guns used by the bushi (武士, ""soldiers"") are not very effective against them.

Kizumonogatari Part 3: Reiketsu,"Koyomi Araragi, a second year high school student at Naoetsu High School, befriends Tsubasa Hanekawa, the top honors student at his school. Tsubasa mentions a rumor about a “blonde vampire” that has been sighted around their town recently. Koyomi, who is usually anti-social, takes a liking to Tsubasa’s down-to-earth personality. That evening, Koyomi encounters this rumored vampire: she is Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, also known as the “King of Apparitions.” The blonde, golden-eyed vampire cries out for Koyomi to save her as she lies in a pool of her own blood, all four of her limbs having been cut off by three vampire hunters. Kiss-shot asks Koyomi to give her his blood in order to save her life, and when he does, Koyomi finds himself reborn as her vampire subordinate.
Now a vampire, Koyomi is charged with retrieving Kiss-shot's severed limbs from the vampire hunters who took them. Before he confronts the first hunter, the gigantic full-vampire Dramaturgy, he has a conversation with Tsubasa. He hides his vampire nature, but Tsubasa is still interested in the rumors about vampires being spread around. At the fight, Dramaturgy tears Koyomi's arms off in one blow, but Koyomi discovers his vampire power of rapid regeneration. Seeing the fight as lost, Dramaturgy surrenders Kiss-shot's leg to Koyomi. At the time, Kiss-shot has taken the form of a child. But she morphs into a young teenager after she consumes her adult leg.
Koyomi next fights the vampire-human half-breed Episode, who can transform into mist and wields a giant silver cross as a weapon. Tsubasa walks into the fight and is disemboweled by Episode. Before she dies, Tsubasa points out to Koyomi that he can defeat Episode by throwing sand into his mist form. Koyomi uses sand to overwhelm Episode and beats Episode savagely. Meme Oshino, an ally of Kiss-shot, gets Koyomi to calm down and, for a price of ¥3 million, informs Koyomi that he can use his own blood to heal Tsubasa. Koyomi then uses his own blood to save Tsubasa's life. Consumption of the second leg enables Kiss-shot to morph into a young adult.
Koyomi now must face the fully human priest Guillotine Cutter for Kiss-shot's arms. Before the fight, he desperately pleads with Tsubasa to leave for her own safety. Tsubasa ultimately agrees, leaving her panties with Koyomi as a promise that they will reunite later. Nonetheless, Guillotine Cutter kidnaps Tsubasa, and Meme advises that Koyomi must ""forget about being human again"" in order to rescue her. Koyomi uses a power to transform his arms into tree roots to defeat Guillotine Cutter and save Tsubasa, but appears to have abandoned his wish to become human again.
Koyomi and Meme finally succeed at fully restoring Kiss-shot. Koyomi expects Kiss-Shot to then change him back to human. But before that, Kiss-shot and Koyomi spend an evening on a rooftop, where Kiss-shot reminisces about her previous subordinate, a Samurai who chose to commit suicide when Kiss-shot was not able to restore his humanity. Koyomi goes off to buy food, but when he returns he finds Kiss-shot eating the eviscerated corpse of Guillotine Cutter. He is horrified at the realization that Kiss-Shot will now hunt humans again, and that he himself will want to hunt as well.
The realization leaves Koyomi despondent enough to want to die. But then Tsubasa appears and persuades Koyomi to stay alive. She also points out that Koyomi himself has the power to stop Kiss-shot. Tsubasa's comforting words, as well as a clumsy attempt to fondle her breasts, bring Koyomi's spirits up enough to face Kiss-shot in a fight.
Kiss-shot and Koyomi face off in the Tokyo Olympic stadium. They repeatedly tear each other's limbs and heads off, but then regenerate their appendages back. Finally, Koyomi weakens Kiss-shot by sucking out her blood. But Tsubasa suddenly realizes that Kiss-shot wants to die. Kiss-shot admits that she was going to throw the fight, and explains that she has to die to restore a subordinate's humanity, but couldn't do so for her previous subordinate because she was too scared of death. Kiss-shot demands that Koyomi kill her, but Koyomi instead yells for Meme's help. Meme proposes a solution that will ""make everyone miserable"": Koyomi will suck out Kiss-shot's blood only to the point that she is too weak to hunt humans, leaving them both quasi-versions of vampire and human. Over Kiss-shot's protestations, Koyomi chooses this path. The next day, Koyomi explains to Tsubasa that he is mostly human but does have some vampire traits. Kiss-shot now has the form of a child, and can only eat by regularly sucking Koyomi's blood."

Shortly after entering the mansion, the doors lock behind them. Hiroshi doubts that the mansion is haunted, but soon finds himself being pursued by an enigmatic purple Oni. Hiroshi must now find a way to save as many of his friends as possible and escape the mansion alive.

The Oni is a muscular, tall humanoid with purple skin who is roughly twice the size of an average human. When he appears in the game, a characteristic ""shrieking"" string chord plays until the player outruns him. Normally, his mouth is kept closed in an amused smirk, but in a secret ending he is shown to have a set of sharp, knife-like teeth. If the Oni captures and kills one of Hiroshi's friends, they too turn into an Oni, distinguishable by their hairstyles, which they kept when transformed by the Oni. In addition to the standard Oni, the player can enter an ""Oni Room"" containing numerous deformed, mutated and completely original Onis, including a rectangular oni called ""Blockman"", who resembles the popular Japanese character Domo-kun, and a gigantic, muscle-bound Oni who humorously appears to be hefting invisible weights when encountered for the first time. Both of these Onis can chase the player more than once if the player enters their names when creating a new game.
In general, the Oni will chase the player at random after he has first been seen, but several of the chases are necessary to advance the storyline."

Asuna, Lisbeth and Silica encourage Kirito to play OS upon hearing that Aincrad bosses have appeared. Kirito joins Asuna and Klein in a boss fight where the game's mascot, AI idol singer Yuna, appears and gives players buff effects as she sings. Kirito fails to achieve anything due to lack of physical strength and quickness. Eiji, the number-two player, aides the group in defeating the boss. Before Asuna makes the killing blow, Eiji whispers the word ""Switch,"" a game mechanic from SAO that she recognizes.
The next night, Asuna joins Klein and his group for another boss fight while waiting for their last group member, unaware that he was injured by Eiji the night before. Asuna proceeds to the fight which is again presided over by Yuna. Klein and his group are ambushed and defeated by the sudden appearance of another boss and Eiji. The following morning, as Kirito practices with OS in a park, a girl in a white hood appears and points off into the distance before disappearing. Kirito meets with Asuna, who theorizes that Eiji was a member of the Knights of the Blood Oath named Nautilus, while Yui deduces that the spawn locations of the Aincrad bosses line up with the SAO dungeon maps.
Asuna, Lisbeth and Silica enter another fight where Yuna and Eiji appear again. Asuna is hit by the boss and passes out upon saving Silica who was pushed into the boss' path by Eiji. Asuna realizes her memories of SAO are fading and at a hospital visit with Kirito, learn that the Augma scanned her brain for SAO memories and that it could also happen to other SAO survivors playing OS. Kirito investigates the issue with Sinon during a boss battle, where an SAO player is defeated and a glowing orb floats upward into an OS drone. Yui fails to retrieve it after being locked out by the game. Later, Kirito meets the hooded girl again who repeats her actions from before. Kirito and Yui discover she is pointing towards Touto Technical University.
Kirito goes to the school and meets Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura who developed Augma, but Shigemura refuses to answer any questions. Before leaving, Kirito notices on Shigemura's desk a picture of a girl who resembles Yuna. Kirito discusses with Kikuoka Seijirou, who informs him that Shigemura's daughter, Yuna, died in SAO. Visiting Asuna's home, Kirito promises Asuna to get her memories back. Kirito encounters the hooded girl again, revealed to be Yuna. When she tells him his rank is too low, Kirito decides to level up, solo-killing as many bosses as he can with aid from Sinon and Leafa.
Days later, the OS players gather at a stadium for Yuna's concert. In the lower levels, Kirito duels with Eiji who claims he has a way to return Asuna's memories. Kirito wins but Eiji reveals that Shigemura has been harvesting memories of SAO players in an attempt to reconstruct his lost daughter's soul and download her as an AI; having all players in the concert would make removing memories easier. Eiji adds that the drones used for harvesting possess enough power to damage the players' brains, killing them like the NerveGear did in SAO.
As a horde of Aincrad bosses raid the arena, Kirito and Yuna join the battle. Yuna tells Kirito that the Augma has a hidden full-dive feature and he can use it to defeat SAO's 100th floor boss to end the battle. Before diving, Kirito gives Asuna an engagement ring. Entering the Ruby Palace of Floor 100, Kirito, Lisbeth, Silica, Agil, and Sinon confront the boss. They are easily defeated until Asuna, Leafa, Klein, and several others from ALO and GGO come to their aid. Yui restores their saved abilities from SAO, allowing everyone to defeat the boss. The voice of Akihiko Kayaba congratulates them on their victory and gives Kirito an extremely powerful sword as a reward.
The group returns to the arena still in full-dive where Kirito, now OS's top-ranked player, dispatches the bosses with his new sword as Kikuoka finds Shigemura in the server room of Argus (the defunct company that ran SAO) and arrests him. The hooded Yuna restores the survivors' memories and fades out of existence since she was coded from the Floor 100 boss. Afterwards, Kirito and Asuna fulfill their promise they made to each other in Aincrad, to watch a meteor shower together. Asuna returns Kirito's engagement ring so to properly put it on her hand, which he does.
In a post-credits scene, Kikuoka, who was impressed with Shigemura's attempt at AI and soul reconstruction, recruits Shigemura to Rath."

When she wakes up, she appears to remember him in personal terms.
That autumn, the school holds a fair. Mayu visits the school again to meet Kaori, in the process informing Saki, Kujo, and Shogo of the latter's condition. She reveals that she had indirectly caused Kaori's accident and amnesia. During middle school, when Kujo had to transfer to Tokyo, he confessed his love for Kaori and asked to meet her one last time before he moved away. Words of the confession reached out to the school, ostracizing Kaori due to Kujo's popularity among the female students. They, including Mayu, sabotaged the meeting by throwing insults at Kaori, who fled in shame and was hit by a car. Following this revelation, Kaori fully remembers Kujo. Realizing that he could never compete with someone she remembers permanently, Yuki decides to stop befriending Kaori and tearfully burns the shared journal. Despite this, he politely rejects Saki's love confession several months later, declaring that he only have eyes for Kaori.
The next two spring seasons, Yuki and Kaori graduate. Kaori is called to the library to return a book, which turns out to be the French dictionary Yuki had borrowed a year ago using her member card. She learns that Yuki has illustrated the content of their shared journal into flip book drawings inside the dictionary. Finally remembering him, she rushes to meet him and asks to be her friend, an offer he accepts."
Kyō no Kira-kun,"Ninon Okamura is an introverted high schoolgirl who cannot talk with anyone other than her parents and Kansai dialect-speaking pet parrot, Sensei, due to the trauma of being bullied when she was in elementary school. However, her life changes when her mother requests her to befriend her next-door neighbor and classmate, Yuiji Kira, who suffers from a heart disease and likely only has one year left to live. Ninon encourages Kira to abandon his lewd lifestyle and instead fill his life with happiness, vowing to always remain on his side. The two become fast friends and ultimately fall for each other, though both are aware that their relationship likely has no future.
In the meantime, Ninon and Kira's relationship is rocked by several events, including Kira's brief relationship with the school nurse, Mio Shitara, who seeks solace after her fiance's death, Kira's estrangement from his tsundere friend Kazuhiro Yabe who once became the ringleader of Ninon's bullies until he humbles himself and falls in love with her, as well as Kira's ambiguous relationship with Rei Uchida, although she is revealed to be a mere sociopath who does not like indecisive people and later befriends Ninon after the misunderstanding is cleared. Yabe and Rei later develop feelings for each other and become a couple.
As time goes on, Kira's illness grows worse and he has to go overseas to find medication that can finally cure it. While his illness ultimately subsides after several tense months, the Kira family is left in great debt and have to move to Osaka to find work, separating Kira from Ninon just as the two are reunited. Meanwhile, Sensei grows a tumor and loses his ability to talk, ultimately dying a few months after Kira's return. Ninon's depression is prevented, though, with a video recorded by Sensei telling her to lift her face and move on with her life.
Several years afterward, Ninon and Kira are shown visiting Tokyo Tower with their son, who speaks in the Kansai dialect."

Haruta & Chika,"Freshman high school student and flute novice Chika Homura wants to reopen her high school's Brass Club, which abruptly closed a year before. However, the principal refuses to give permit unless she manages to gather nine members in three weeks time. Although she is helped by her childhood friend, Haruta Kamijo, who plays the French horn, none of the ex-members seem interested to accept her invitation. Nevertheless, when Chika shows determination while convincing junior Kyoji Miyamoto, a sulky alto saxophone player, to join, members begin to trickle into the club: seniors and couple Seiji Katagiri and Wakaba Noguchi, who play trumpet and oboe, are the first to join, followed by freshmen Megumi Nagatsuka and Taeko Yonezawa, who play trombone and tuba, respectively. Kyoji also decides to sign up after some hesitation.
Chika and Haruta attempt to invite senior Naoko Serizawa, a talented clarinet player, next, but she harshly refuses. Instead, Haruta deduces from a local radio station Chika regularly listens to locate Serizawa's close friend, Kaiyu Hiyama, a percussion player. Kaiyu dropped out of school to take his late grandfather's place to run a retirement home, and his departure was what caused the Brass Club's disbandment. Despite some misgivings, he ultimately chooses to return to school and join the club. His entry does favor to the club's fortune: once the team locate clarinet player and junior Kota Tezuka, the ninth member before the deadline, more and more students, many of them ex-members, sign up until the membership swells to 20.
Under the tutelage of music teacher Shinjiro Kusakabe, the club trains for the national competition. Because Chika has never played an instrument before, she has the most difficulty integrating and drags the other members back. This briefly causes a rift in the club, although Haruta manages to rally them together to help Chika. Haruta also personally encourages Chika when the latter blames herself upon learning that many members have to sacrifice their private goals to focus on the Brass Club. Chika is further encouraged in her endeavor by Serizawa, whom she befriended after she helped her find her hearing aid. While Serizawa does not sign up, she teaches Chika how to play a difficult note.
During the competition, Chika fails her part and the team loses as a result. Disheartened, she temporarily leaves the club. To instill her spirit back, Haruta arranges for the Brass Club to play the score used for the competition, ""Spring Light, Summer Wind"". At the last second, Chika joins and, following two failed attempts, manages to get her part right."

Ancien and the Magic Tablet (a.k.a. Napping Princess),"The plot of Napping Princess takes place in two concurrent settings: a near-future Japan and Heartland, a fantastical realm. The main character, Kokone Morikawa, has strange dreams of Heartland while taking naps. In these dreams, Heartland is a society entirely revolving around cars; the King's castle is a car factory, and his subjects all come to it to make a constant stream of new cars. His daughter, Ancien (who appears as a younger Kokone), has a ""magic tablet"" computer she uses to give life to various machines: notably, a blue toy bear named Joy, and a motorcycle named Heart. The king disapproves of this, however, and orders Ancien confined to her tower. Additionally, the society of Heartland is under threat from a gigantic monster of molten metal called the Colossus. The king builds giant robots to face the Colossus. Ancien, spying a motorcycle-driving subject of the king's named Peach, decides to ally with him and seek to defeat the Colossus together with him, while the king's chief adviser Bewan plots against the king and Ancien alike.
In normal Japan, Kokone is finishing up her school term, considering where to go to college, and reconnecting with old friend Morio who has returned from Tokyo from his first year in college. Kokone lives with her single father Momotarō; her mother perished in an accident while Kokone was still young, and Kokone complains that her father never told her much about her mother. Momotarō is an eccentric car mechanic and has a jacket similar to Peach's, a blue bear doll, a motorcycle, and a cracked tablet, all similar to the ones seen in Kokone's dreams. The situation takes a turn for the worse when Momotarō is unceremoniously arrested three days prior to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and accused of stealing the car company Shijima Motors' secrets. A suited figure who looks identical to the Heartland king's evil adviser visits the Morikawa home, and is overheard to be searching for both the tablet and Kokone. Via text message from jail, Momotarō warns his daughter not to trust the adviser, who is named Watanabe. The message includes a picture of a younger Momotarō, his wife, and Watanabe. With Morio's help, Kokone evades Watanabe and his men and recovers the stolen tablet and bear doll, driving away in the family's motorcycle. They also discover a business card for Isshin Shijima, the chairman of Shijima Motors, and consider visiting him for help after Kokone is told that her mother, Ikumi, was the daughter of the Chairman. The two take a nap in the motorcycle, visit Heartland where they dream of the motorcycle soaring through the sky, and are surprised to find on waking up that the motorcycle has driven itself to Osaka overnight before running out of gas. Kokone's attempts to contact her father via the tablet seemingly fail, but surprisingly enough, the ""magic"" seems to work in the real world when a request to the tablet's e-Heart chat for train tickets results in an attendant giving them paid-for Shinkansen tickets to Tokyo. There, Kokone seeks an audience with the Chairman, while Morio learns that mechanics from Shijima Motors were the ones who saw Kokone's message and had bought the tickets for the pair. The mechanics explain that after the chairman's daughter had a falling out with her father and eloped with Momotarō, they used this chat to keep in contact with Momotarō, who had been continuing his wife's self-driving car programming and research. Ikumi had run a project researching self-driving car technology years ago, but Ikumi's father, as chairman, refused her proposal at the time.
Kokone has a final dream of Ancien and Peach's adventures, but unlike earlier dreams, Kokone appears as a separate bystander rather than as Ancien. Ancien seeks to empower one of the giant robots with her magic tablet over the objections of the captain. While the empowered robot engages with the Colossus, the captain turns off the engines. Ancien frantically attempts to reignite the engines, but falls off the robot. Peach keeps her in his grip, but she loses her grasp. Appearing now as Ikumi (rather than a young Kokone), she swears to help out Peach one last time, then falls to her death and cracks the tablet's glass. Kokone understands that the bedtime stories she was told as a young girl of ""Ancien and the Magic Tablet"" by her father that she has been dreaming of were actually stories of her mother. Now, Shijima Motors has changed course and wants to use the once ignored technology to impress the world during the Olympics with self-driving cars, hence Watanabe's frantic hunt for the tablet. Kokone, prominently carrying Ikumi's old bear doll Joy, finds Chairman Shijima, who talks of his regrets. The action shifts to Heartland, where Bewan / Watanabe detains Kokone. He describes his plan to overthrow the King via letting the King's giant robots fail, and then to prominently save the kingdom with his own giant robot. The King orders Watanabe arrested, while Peach enters the remaining robot to do battle with the Colossus, which Kokone empowers with the tablet. Watanabe manages to emit a ""curse"" from his cell phone to sabotage the robot, and the kingdom is briefly engulfed in flames. Regardless, Peach and Kokone are able to prevail over the Colossus, albeit via flying into space and crashing back to Heartland. In the real world, Kokone and her father Momotarō are now stuck in the rafters of the building while Watanabe is carried off, and Momotarō is holding onto Kokone just as Peach once had for Ancien. The people beneath, and the self-driving motorcycle Heart, in seeming fulfillment of Ikumi's claim to be there for the family one more time when it is most needed, are able to drag a giant balloon into place; as the family falls, they hit every banner to slow their descent, and survive the fall thanks to the balloon. A safe Kokone, seeing the company's motto on the banners explains that her name must have been based on the company's motto, a combination of ""heart"" (kokoro) and ""wing"" (hane).
During the credits, scenes of Momotarō and Ikumi's courtship, and the original tests of her software, are shown."

March Comes in Like a Lion: Part 1,"Rei Kiriyama is a 17 year old professional shōgi player and is the fifth person to become a professional in middle school. Rei was orphaned at a young age when his parents and sister were killed in a car accident, but is taken in by his father's best friend – Masachika Kōda, a professional shōgi player – when he realizes Rei's talent for shōgi. Rei and Masachika's children – Kyoko and Ayamu – fail to get along at all when Kōda begin's to show more favor for Rei, with Kyoko becoming particularly antagonistic towards the young Rei. After his adoptive father forces his children to stop playing shōgi when they are unable to defeat Rei, he decides to live independently, hoping that his absence might lessen the stress on the family brought on by his presence. He begins living alone in a single-room apartment in Rokugatsu-chō and stops going to school, only to start going to high school after a year delay.
When Rei defeats his adoptive father in shōgi in a professional match, he goes into a panic out of guilt, and ends up collapsing in the street when he accidentally gets drunk. He is discovered by the kindly Akari Kawamoto, who welcomes him into her home to re-cooperate. Waking up in the Kawamoto home in Sangatsu-chō and meets Akari's two sisters: Hinata and Momo Kawamoto, who are under the care of Akari, their grandfather and their aunt following the sister's mother's death. Rei begins spending time with the Kawamotos, practically becoming a member of the family and they even spend New Years together.
When spending the holidays with the Kawamotos, Rei runs into Kyoko and her boyfriend, middle aged professional shōgi player, Masamune Gotō. When Rei expresses his disgust with his adoptive sister's relationship with the older, married man, Gotō beats down a furious Rei. Rei then forces Gotō to agree to break off his relationship with Kyoko if he can defeat the elder shōgi player in the finals of Lion King shōgi tournament. Rei begins solely focusing on shōgi. When he faces off against Kai Shimada in the semi-finals, Rei completely underestimates his opponent, and loses the match in shame. Still reeling from the loss, Rei runs into Kyoko again, who believes that he told their father about her relationship with Gotō due to her being cut off financially. They are interrupted by the Kawamoto sisters, who had been coming to deliver a large box lunch to Rei. Kyoko spends the night at Rei's place but leaves the following morning, with Rei realizing that his relationship with his sister has left them in a state where they can never truly be siblings or strangers. Shimada faces off against Gotō in the Lion King final match, fighting for the chance to face off against Tōji Sōya, the reigning Meijin who has retained the position for over a decade. When Shimada emerges as victor against Gotō, Rei approaches the exhausted pro and asks to join Shimada's shōgi study group in hopes of bettering himself. Shimada accepts.
Rei begins making his way through the Newcomer shōgi tournament, with his rival and close friend, Harunobu Nikaidō excitedly pushing Rei along so the two might be able to face off against each other in the finals. However, Rei is shocked when he discovered that not only had Nikaidō had been eliminated, he had been hospitalized, due to a life long condition that leaves him constantly unwell. Rei realizes that Nikaidō's opponent, Junkei Yamazaki knew of Nikaidō's condition and stalled out the game as much as possible to exhaust Nikaidō and instigate a win by default. Rei faces off against Yamazaki in the Newcomer finals, ready to avenge his friend. However, as Rei is about to make a rash aggressive move instead of defending and improving his position on the board, he suddenly remembers Nikaidō's passionate words of advice to cherish his shogi more, and elects to take the safer option. Rei realizes that the reason Yamazaki played dirty was out of desperation to win, similar to Rei's own desperation to defeat Gotō in the Lion King tournament. With that, Rei emerges as victor and becomes the Newcomer King. Kyoko congratulates Rei on his victory.
After the conclusion of the Newcomer Tournament, Rei accompanies Shimada as he plays against Sōya. As the match plays out heavily in Soya's favor, Rei, who is acting as board commentator on the match, desperately insists that game could still be won by Shimada, only to be dismissed by Gotō. Seeing an unnoticed move that Shimada could have taken to turn the game completely around, Rei runs to Shimada, only realize that Shimada had already resigned. Sōya remarks that Shimada has unfortunately missed a potential move that would have turned the tide on the game, the very same move that Rei had noticed. As Sōya makes his exit, he turns towards an awestruck Rei and goes off in the rain.
After his victory in the Newcomer tournament, Rei is asked to have a commemorative shōgi match against Tōji Sōya as a marketing ploy, as both of them are professional shōgi players who made their start in middle school, and that since Rei have become the Newcomer champion like Soya did, people had begun to expect Rei to become Meijin himself one day. Despite the gap of their skill level, Rei plays the game with the intention of winning, and finds himself entranced in the joy of playing with a powerful opponent.

Hina reveals that a friend of hers was being bullied at school, and in defending her friend, she became a target as well. Hina admits privately to Rei that while she was scared that she might become a target if she intervened, and even though no one – not even her teacher – helped her, she insists that she does not regret defending her friend and what she did was absolutely not wrong. Rei, who had spent his childhood isolated and bullied, is deeply touched by Hina's words. Feeling as though Hina saved him, Rei thanks Hina and promises to stay by her side. Rei initially tries to save up prize money from his shogi games help Hina, but when his teacher points out that the Kawamotos would never accept the money, he simply tries to be emotionally supportive of Hina instead. The bullying eventually comes to a head when Hina's homeroom teacher has a breakdown over the bullying, drawing the rest of the school's attention to the bullying and finally putting a stop to it. Rei apologizes for being ultimately unable to help Hina, but Hina insists that simply being on her side and listening to her was enough and thanks him.
The Kawamoto sisters are then visited by their long-absent father, Seijirō; who had left the sister's mother when he had a child with another woman. When he says he wants part of the family again, Rei is asked by Akari to help, who uncovers that Seijirō had been fired from his job and is being forced to leave his work-provided apartment, suggesting that he is only asking the Kawamoto sisters to join his new family out of desperation. Seijirō insists that Rei is not relevant to the discussion as he is not a member of the family, to which Rei responds with claiming that he has every intention of marrying Hinata at some point in the future, which shocks Hina. When Seijirō goes to pick up Momo from nursery school without telling the family, Rei snaps at Seijirō, but over steps his bounds and alienates the Kawamotos in the process. In despair, Rei once again fully dedicates himself to shōgi, with plans to once again drop out of school.
The Kawamoto sisters appear to give their father the benefit of the doubt, agreeing to his offer to spend the day at an amusement part. However, they ultimately decide that they do not want him to be part of the family and elect to cut him out of their lives permanently after having one last fond memory with him.
During a match, it is revealed to Masamune Gotō that his wife, who has been in a coma for several years, had passed away. Although heartbroken, Gotō ultimately realizes that with his wife gone, he's become better at shōgi now that he's not worried about her anymore. To that end, he breaks up with Kyoko so he can further put his focus on shōgi. Kyoko returns to the Kōda home in a drunken stupor, angrily asking her father how he can dedicate himself to the sport that had ruined their family. The following morning, Mr. Kōda speaks to Kyoko about the time she hit Rei after losing to him at shōgi. He shows her that if she had looked closer, she could have turned the game around to her favor, but since she didn't believe in herself, she failed to see the opportunity. He promises to Kyoko that no matter what she chooses in life, he will always support her.
Rei and Gotō face off against each other in the Lion King final, and play a very close match. Rei, still heartbroken over the schism he caused with Kawamotos, appears to have a breakdown while playing against Gotō. As the game continues, he breaks into tears. Gotō chides the younger pro for acting indecently while playing shōgi, before admitting defeat to Rei. As the journalists come to interview Rei, Rei runs past them to the Kawamoto home. At the door, he apologizes to Hina and the other two sisters for hurting them while trying to defend them, admitting that in the end, he was completely terrified of losing them.

March Comes in Like a Lion: Part 2,"Rei Kiriyama is a 17 year old professional shōgi player and is the fifth person to become a professional in middle school. Rei was orphaned at a young age when his parents and sister were killed in a car accident, but is taken in by his father's best friend – Masachika Kōda, a professional shōgi player – when he realizes Rei's talent for shōgi. Rei and Masachika's children – Kyoko and Ayamu – fail to get along at all when Kōda begin's to show more favor for Rei, with Kyoko becoming particularly antagonistic towards the young Rei. After his adoptive father forces his children to stop playing shōgi when they are unable to defeat Rei, he decides to live independently, hoping that his absence might lessen the stress on the family brought on by his presence. He begins living alone in a single-room apartment in Rokugatsu-chō and stops going to school, only to start going to high school after a year delay.
When Rei defeats his adoptive father in shōgi in a professional match, he goes into a panic out of guilt, and ends up collapsing in the street when he accidentally gets drunk. He is discovered by the kindly Akari Kawamoto, who welcomes him into her home to re-cooperate. Waking up in the Kawamoto home in Sangatsu-chō and meets Akari's two sisters: Hinata and Momo Kawamoto, who are under the care of Akari, their grandfather and their aunt following the sister's mother's death. Rei begins spending time with the Kawamotos, practically becoming a member of the family and they even spend New Years together.
When spending the holidays with the Kawamotos, Rei runs into Kyoko and her boyfriend, middle aged professional shōgi player, Masamune Gotō. When Rei expresses his disgust with his adoptive sister's relationship with the older, married man, Gotō beats down a furious Rei. Rei then forces Gotō to agree to break off his relationship with Kyoko if he can defeat the elder shōgi player in the finals of Lion King shōgi tournament. Rei begins solely focusing on shōgi. When he faces off against Kai Shimada in the semi-finals, Rei completely underestimates his opponent, and loses the match in shame. Still reeling from the loss, Rei runs into Kyoko again, who believes that he told their father about her relationship with Gotō due to her being cut off financially. They are interrupted by the Kawamoto sisters, who had been coming to deliver a large box lunch to Rei. Kyoko spends the night at Rei's place but leaves the following morning, with Rei realizing that his relationship with his sister has left them in a state where they can never truly be siblings or strangers. Shimada faces off against Gotō in the Lion King final match, fighting for the chance to face off against Tōji Sōya, the reigning Meijin who has retained the position for over a decade. When Shimada emerges as victor against Gotō, Rei approaches the exhausted pro and asks to join Shimada's shōgi study group in hopes of bettering himself. Shimada accepts.
Rei begins making his way through the Newcomer shōgi tournament, with his rival and close friend, Harunobu Nikaidō excitedly pushing Rei along so the two might be able to face off against each other in the finals. However, Rei is shocked when he discovered that not only had Nikaidō had been eliminated, he had been hospitalized, due to a life long condition that leaves him constantly unwell. Rei realizes that Nikaidō's opponent, Junkei Yamazaki knew of Nikaidō's condition and stalled out the game as much as possible to exhaust Nikaidō and instigate a win by default. Rei faces off against Yamazaki in the Newcomer finals, ready to avenge his friend. However, as Rei is about to make a rash aggressive move instead of defending and improving his position on the board, he suddenly remembers Nikaidō's passionate words of advice to cherish his shogi more, and elects to take the safer option. Rei realizes that the reason Yamazaki played dirty was out of desperation to win, similar to Rei's own desperation to defeat Gotō in the Lion King tournament. With that, Rei emerges as victor and becomes the Newcomer King. Kyoko congratulates Rei on his victory.
After the conclusion of the Newcomer Tournament, Rei accompanies Shimada as he plays against Sōya. As the match plays out heavily in Soya's favor, Rei, who is acting as board commentator on the match, desperately insists that game could still be won by Shimada, only to be dismissed by Gotō. Seeing an unnoticed move that Shimada could have taken to turn the game completely around, Rei runs to Shimada, only realize that Shimada had already resigned. Sōya remarks that Shimada has unfortunately missed a potential move that would have turned the tide on the game, the very same move that Rei had noticed. As Sōya makes his exit, he turns towards an awestruck Rei and goes off in the rain.
After his victory in the Newcomer tournament, Rei is asked to have a commemorative shōgi match against Tōji Sōya as a marketing ploy, as both of them are professional shōgi players who made their start in middle school, and that since Rei have become the Newcomer champion like Soya did, people had begun to expect Rei to become Meijin himself one day. Despite the gap of their skill level, Rei plays the game with the intention of winning, and finds himself entranced in the joy of playing with a powerful opponent. Rei also learns of Sōya's secret, that he is completely deaf for unknown reasons – a fact only known to the people who have faced him in sh

Eiga Tamagotchi: Himitsu no Otodake Daisakusen!,"Following the events of Tamagotchi: Happiest Story in the Universe!, Mametchi, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and all other Tamagotchi Planet residents move on with their daily lives. However, a very famous Tamagotchi idol named Lovelin moves to Tamagotchi Town to host a footrace. The following day, at school, a shy, yet sweet new girl named Lovelitchi came to class. Little were her classmates aware that she was actually Lovelin. Poor experiences in prior schools caused Lovelitchi to decide to keep her Lovelin identity a secret when transferring to Tamagotchi School. After Mametchi told Lovelitchi he sees her as a Tama-Friend, she soon gets nervous due to the fact that Tama-Friends are never dishonest with each other. On Mametchi's birthday, Lovelitchi announced that she was, indeed, Lovelin. She feared that her newly-made friendships would come to an end, but everyone was quick to forgive her, and she was relieved. Daily life continued from that point until a legend about ""The Kuchipatchi of Truth"" was learned about by Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi. It caused a variety of shenanigans, included being teleported back in time and Lovelitchi's cell phone, Telelin, coming to life. Not long after the legend of The Kuchipatchi of Truth was discovered, an outgoing violinist named Melodytchi moves to Tamagotchi Town. Lovelitchi quickly became friends with her and they became an idol and violinist duet, performing many songs together. Not too long afterward, a bright and optimistic fashion designer named Moriritchi moves in and quickly became Tama-Friends with the cast, especially Lovelitchi and Melodytchi. Shortly after, a human girl named Tomomi arrives on Tamagotchi Planet following a malfunction from one of Mametchi's inventions. At that time, a new conflict unfolds; the legend of the Tama-Hearts. These mythical hearts were floating about on Tamagotchi Planet, and if they weren't found in time, Tamagotchi Planet would face a permanent curse. Mametchi created Tama-Profies, devices that could store the Tama-Hearts shortly after they were uncovered, and gave them to Lovelitchi and Melodytchi. Every time a Tama-Heart was found, Lovelitchi and Melodytchi would take out their Tama-Profies and store the Tama-Heart inside. At one time around that time, a mysterious Tamagotchi named Kizunatchi got out of the devices and offered to help with the search. Not long after, Tomomi leaves to return to the Earth and a new Tamagotchi girl with a massive crush on Mametchi, Himespetchi, arrives and agrees to help with the search. With all the Tama-Hearts eventually found and stored in the Tama-Profies, citizens of Tamagotchi Town were soon turning into eggs. This was the beginning for what may be a permanent curse in Tamagotchi Planet, and if the Tama-Hearts weren't returned to their respective pillars on Heart Island in time, a rather unhappy ending is rest assured. Luckily, The Tamagotchis make it to Heart Island just before the curse gets any worse and manage to store the Tama-Hearts in their proper pillars. The sky then darkens, making them think something awful is bound to happen. Mametchi, Lovelitchi, Melodytchi, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and Himespetchi each made their hopes on the Tamagotchi Planet being Okay and the Egg curse to being stopped. Kizunatchi, only able to do so much to stop the curse, descented in a manner that saddened her Tama-Friends and made them run towards her, screaming her name. Kizunatchi soon changed appearance and ended the egg curse once and for all. Everyone was turned back to their regular selves and, after a tearful farewell to Kizunatchi, everything went back to normal. Ms. Perfect called Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi, and announced that the three Tamagotchis have won the Robotic Soccer Tournament and that they would be transferring to Dream Town in light of their Victory. The entire class was surprised, especially Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi. Makiko remarked that the three will need to leave Tamagotchi Town, making Himespetchi tear up in the thought that her love was leaving.
Following Ms. Perfect's announcement, Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi take to Dream Town by plane. Each of them were given Home-Stay residences by the Principle of Dream School. Kuchipatchi's was a fancy restaurant named Dream Hakken, and Memetchi's was a beautiful salon called Salon de Dream. While this seemed like paradise for Kuchipatchi, Memetchi, and Mametchi's home stay wasn't quite the same way. He did a homestay in a garage with an elder Tamagotchi named Ikaritchi, who didn't think very fond of him. Meanwhile, shifting to another story, Yumemitchi, the sweet daughter of a wealthy Tamagotchi family, meets up with her best Tama-Friend, Kiraritchi. The girls achieve so much more together than either one could on their own, and they share a dream; to become famous idols, which was inspired by a duet called D2. Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi see D2 as role models, and after dancing and singing to help get a lion's thorn out of its paw at a circus, a fortune-telling Tamagotchi gives them mythical bags called Yume Kira Bags, which must be used with careful consideration and much be kept secret from other Tamagotchis. Not long afterward, a surprise awaits Mametchi and friends; Himespetchi returns to reunite with her crush and to fulfill her dream of being Mametchi's bride. The Yume Kira Bags cause Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi to undergo disguise and assist other Tamagotchis with tight situations. One Christmas in Dream Town, a Tamagotchi named Yumecantchi emerges from the bags to help the two after Yumemitchi wished for a Tama-Pet of her own. While Yumemitchi admires her cute charms, Kiraritchi thinks it's an overreaction. Not long after, Mametchi refused to take anymore of Ikaritchi's mistreatment for him and ran away, trying to find a new homestay. The next day, a friendly pianist named Pianitchi came to Dream Town to reunite with her mother, Cafe Mama, who runs Music Cafe. She befriended Mametchi and helped him change Ikaritchi's ways. After Ikaritchi was reminded about a childhood memory picking apples with a friend, he finally displays his courteous side to Mametchi, and parted Dream Town to sell the apples. Mametchi has since done a homestay at Music Cafe with Pianitchi. Yumemitchi, Kiraritchi, Memetchi, Pianitchi, and Himespetchi soon formed a band called the Kira Kira Girls. After an important performance, Dream Town learned that Himespetchi had to leave under her parents' request. After a tearful farewell, a talkative make-up artist named Coffretchi moved in and agreed to take Himespetchi's place in the Kira Kira Girls' band. Later on, after Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi make frequent use of the Yume Kira Bag, a Tamagotchi named Nandetchi notices the true identities and decided to take photos of them and show them to Dream School, much to the girls' humiliation. After reconsolidation, Nandetchi tore up the photos. Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi then learned it was time to return the Yume Kira Bags and Yumecantchi back to the fortune teller that gave them the items. Not long afterward, Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi then leave Dream Town and go to Melody Town to study idolism and make their dream come true.
Sometime after Yumemitchi and Kiraritchi pursuit their dream at a new destination, a new story is to be told, and this one is about time. Two Twin sisters were Home sweet Home in Dream Town of the Future. Miraitchi, the one-day older twin, is a little more sarcastic, which Clulutchi, the one-day younger twin, is a little more serious. One day, a mysterious face that calls himself X-Kamen lets loose eight mythical Tama-Pets called Dreambakutchis. The father of the twins, Doctor Future, orders them to go retrieve the Dreambakutchis. Miraitchi and Clulutchi use pocket designers, devices that provide outfits necessary for fulfilling tasks and assignments, to give Miraitchi wings and Clulutchi a hoverboard. While Miraitchi enjoyed flying, Clulutchi feared it. Despite different receptions on taking to the skies, the twins retrieve most of the Dreambakutchis. However, Purplebakutchi, the only one still flying, does something which causes Watchlin, the living watch owned by the twins, to malfunction and send everyone back in time. At that time frame, Mametchi, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, Pianitchi, and Coffretchi were doing homework. That evening, both of the twins were famished, so they headed over to Music Cafe and were warmly welcomed by Mametchi and Pianitchi. Miraitchi and Clulutchi made a request for Mametchi and Tama-Friends; to assist them in getting back the Dreambakutchis so they can go back home, and all 5 Tamagotchis agreed. X-Kamen was still as much of an obstacle in the present as he was in the future. For the time being, Miraitchi and Clulutchi both attended Dream School, when a mysterious boy named Smartotchi was also attending. Pianitchi was quite fond of Smartotchi due to his exceptional piano playing, but little were the Tamagotchis aware that he was X-Kamen in a ""normal"" disguise. Miraitchi and Clulutchi also wanted to become fashion designers, and did a homestay with Madamtchi, owner of the miracle shop, as a result. Smartotchi eventually informed Miraitchi, Clulutchi, and friends that he is actually X-Kamen, and turned from a foe to a friend. Not long after, a cheerful young girl named Candy Paku Paku, who's a close friend of the twins, also teleported to the past and agreed to help find the Dreambakutchis. After all 8 were found, Miraitchi, Clulutchi, Smartotchi, and Candy Paku Paku, despite being reluctant to bid farewell to their friends, did so and returned to the future. .[1]
Every thousand years on Tamagotchi Planet, continents collide in an event called the Tamagottssun, causing Dream Town and Tamagotchi Town to fuse as ""DreamTamatown"". Mametchi, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi reunited with Lovelitchi, Melodytchi, Moriritchi, Himespetchi, Yumemitchi, Kiraritchi, and numerous other characters that left previously. Miraitchi, Clulutchi, and Candy Paku Paku also return to the past to reunite, but Smartotchi didn't for unknown reasons. A Massive reunion took place as the Tamagotchis learn about the legends of the Tamagottssun in a wonderful world. Towards Tamagottssun's conclusion, though, something tragic happens; The Tamagotchi Planet itself is crying, limiting the supply of water available. If Tamagotchi Planet wasn't cheered up in time, it would be a permanent drought and the Tamagotchi species would become extinct because just like humans, Tamagotchis need water to survive. Luckily, with a lot of work and effort, Tamagotchi Planet cheered up, Dream Town and Tamagotchi Town returned to their normal, non-fused statuses, and everyone was home with their families. That, however, didn't stop Mametchi from creating his most developed invention ever; the DreamTama Rainbow. It's a special flying submarine-like vehicle that permitted transportation all across Tamagotchi Planet, meaning that the bonds the citizens of Dream Town made with the citizens of Tamagotchi Town and vice versa can last forevermore. After flashbacks from several episodes from the past few seasons, Mametchi and all his Tama-Friends thanked the viewers for watching and everyone waved good-bye to the viewers to show that the anime has officially ended."
Blade of the Immortal,"Manji is a samurai on the run after killing his corrupt lord and his bodyguards, which included the husband of his sister Machi. As a result of her husbands death at the hands of her brother, Machi lost her mind from grief. Rather than commit ritual suicide as honor dictates, Manji was forced to care after his now insane sister. While on the run, Manji encounters an 800-year-old nun named Yaobikuni who questions him about his decisions distracting him from his sister who runs off. Machi is found being held hostage by a group of ronin out for the bounty on Manji's head. The ronin's leaders demands Manji disarm himself, implying that he would kill Machi if he did not. When Manji does comply with the ronin's demands, the ronin proceeds to kill Machi anyway. In retaliation Manji kills every member of the group before he begins dying from his wounds as Yaobikuni implants ""sacred bloodworms"" into his body.
Fifty two years later, now an ageless immortal, Manji is approached by Rin Asano who requests his aid as bodyguard to help avenge the death of her father, Kurose, at the hands of Kagehisa Anotsu and the Ittō-ryū. While Manji initially refused, he reconsiders when Rin is attacked by the Ittō-ryū member Sabato Kuroi who had the severed head of Rin's mother mounted on his left shoulder. Word of Sabato's death reaches Kagehisa after setting up the Ittō-ryū's contract with Kagimura Habaki for a place in the shogunate, sending Taito Magatsu to deal with Rin and her bodyguard. Magatsu is defeated, but is spared as he reveals Manji's immortality to the other Ittō-ryū members. Manji later encounters the Ittō-ryū member Eiku Shizuma, who reveals himself to have also had bloodworms placed in his body by Yaobikuni while nearly killing Manji with a rare poison that disrupts the bloodworms.
Manji and Rin later arrive in Fukagawa where they encounter Kagehisa's loyal subordinate Makie Otono-Tachibana. While Makie had the upper hands, she could not bring herself to kill Manji out of shock from slashing his arm off. When Rin intervenes, her words reach Makie as she ceased her attack on Manji and left Kagehisa in shame. The duo later encounter the Mugai-ryū, learning that Kagehisa is going to Mt. Takeo to recruit a dojo master. But things go south when the Mugai-ryū's sadist member Shira attacks Rin when she intervened in his attempt to rape a prostitute that the Ittō-ryū hired to pose as Kagehisa, running off after Manji chopped his hand off. Following Rin's encounter with the real Kagehisa, learning that Kagehisa's actions were influenced by the history between their grandfathers Takayoshi Asano and Saburō Anotsu, Rin leaves Manji to continue her hunt alone while he follows.
But when Kagehisa arrives to Mt. Takao, learning later that his followers were murdered in his absence, he learns too late that Habaki set him up as he runs into Rin before they are surrounded by Habaki's men. Manji and Makie arrive soon after, resulting in an epic all-out battle as Makie sacrifices herself to protect Kagehisa while Manji runs off after Shira as he abducts Rin to make the swordsman suffer. Manji learns from his previous mistakes to save Rin and sends Shira falling to his death while Kagehisa kills Habaki, the two swordsmen fighting each other with Manji allowing Rin to deliver the deathblow after he is seemingly killed. But Manji is revealed to still be alive as Rin cries over him."

Fairy Tail: Dragon Cry,"Zash Caine (ザッシュ・ケイン, Zasshu Kein), the Kingdom of Stella's minister of state and a practitioner of black magic, infiltrates the Kingdom of Fiore and steals the Dragon Cry, a mystical staff discovered in the dragon graveyard beneath the capital city. Fiore's royal family enlists Natsu Dragneel and his team from the Fairy Tail guild to recover the staff, detailing that it is imbued with magical power capable of annihilating the kingdom. The wizards follow Zash to Stella, whose ruler, King Animus (アニムス, Animusu), intends to use the staff for a ritual. Upon touching the staff, Natsu triggers an alarm and attracts Zash's attention. After a lengthy pursuit, Fairy Tail is defeated by Zash and the kingdom's elite military unit, the Three Stars – Swan (スワン, Suwan), Doll (ドール, Dōru), and Gapri (ガプリ, Gapuri) – who arrest them and take the staff back.
Natsu escapes from his airborne cell and frees the others, stopping Zash from using Lucy Heartfilia as a blood sacrifice for his magic. The wizards evade Zash with the help of his reluctant accomplice, Sonya (ソーニャ, Sōnya), who is also Animus' aide and childhood friend. Sonya pleads with Fairy Tail to leave the staff in Stella, explaining that the king's ritual could prevent a potential magical disaster from destroying her kingdom. However, Natsu rejects her request, sensing that the staff contains the malicious intent of dragons that were killed by Acnologia.
The wizards re-infiltrate the city to retrieve the staff, defeating the Three Stars in the process. Sonya grabs the Dragon Cry and, realizing its true nature, refuses to give the staff to Animus. Natsu arrives and sees Sonya speaking to herself; possessing Sonya, Animus reveals himself to be a dragon who has sealed himself within her body to cheat death, appearing to her in a human guise to manipulate her. Unable to escape Sonya's body on his own, Animus performs the ritual to free himself using the staff's magic, but only manages to emerge in an imperfect form after Zash steals the staff for himself, wanting vengeance against Fiore for exiling him. Zash uses the staff to activate an army of artificial soldiers against Fairy Tail, then prepares to destroy Fiore with it, but he is unwittingly disintegrated by its magic energy.
In a struggle over the staff, Animus impales Natsu on one of his spikes and finishes absorbing the staff's magic, regaining his full strength. Natsu survives his injury and viciously attacks Animus, half of his body taking on the appearance of a dragon; Animus recognizes Natsu as E.N.D., the ""destroyer of all"", before Natsu defeats him. Returning to normal, Natsu is deeply shaken by his transformation, but Lucy comforts him, saying he still looks like himself. Meanwhile, Sonya shatters the Dragon Cry, deactivating the soldiers and causing Animus' body to fade away. The broken staff reverts to its original form, a ribbon, which is blown away in the breeze.
In a post-credits scene, the ribbon is picked up by Acnologia in his human form. In a flashback 400 years prior, Sonya loses her ribbon after being mortally wounded by Animus' gang of dragons, who are assaulted by Acnologia in retaliation; a dying Animus inhabits Sonya's body during this time, enabling their survival into the present day. In the present, Acnologia callously destroys the ribbon as Zeref observes him from afar alongside Brandish μ and Invel Yura, declaring that his battle with Natsu is imminent."

Hurricane Polymar,"Onigawara, the director of the International Secret Police Agency, looked forward to making Takeshi a top-notch criminal investigator. Takeshi was given training, which turned him into an all-around sportsman as well as martial arts expert. However, Takeshi's attitude toward crime-fighting was so incompatible with Onigawara's, that he disowned him. For a while Takeshi investigated crime alone; then he became a private detective Joe Kuruma's assistant and general handyman under the alias Takeshi Yoroi. Secretly, however, Takeshi obtained from a scientist a new artificial polymer, polymet, that was far stronger than steel. With this polymet Takeshi transformed himself into Hurricane Polymar, an invincible costumed hero for fight for the justice and defeat to the different gangs.[6][7][8]
Hurricane Polymar's main ability, aside from augmented strength and high-speed rotation, is transforming into one of five different vehicles (described below). Polymar's suit can also last up to forty-six minutes and one second before having to transform back; if Takeshi does not reverse the transformation, he is in danger of dying from hyperthermia. Since the suit is powered by magnetism, it is vulnerable to high voltage and will also lose power in temperatures lower than −50 degrees Celsius. When inactive, the suit is disguised as Takeshi's motorcycle helmet.

Blame!,"In the distant technological future, civilization has reached its ultimate Net-based form. An ""infection"" in the past caused the automated systems to spiral out of control, resulting in a multi-leveled city structure that replicates itself infinitely in all directions. Now humanity has lost access to the city's controls and is hunted down to be purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. In a tiny corner of the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and dwindling food supplies. A girl named Zuru goes on a journey to find food for her village with a group of friends, only to inadvertently cause doom when an observation tower senses her and summons a Safeguard pack to eliminate the threat. With her companions dead and all escape routes blocked, the sudden arrival of Killy the Wanderer, on his quest to find a human who possesses the Net Terminal Gene, saves her along with Kae, her close friend.
Killy is brought back to the village, where he meets the two elders of the village, who express interest in him after they hear that he has been from '6000 levels below'. Killy even helps to assist with the village's food problem by passing them a large amount of rations. Abruptly, he leaves for the nearby area named by the villages as the Rotting Shrine, and followed by Zuru and Kae, he finds the spoilt machine-corpse of Cibo, a former scientist from before the disaster. Cibo reveals that it is her that built a shield generator that protects the village from the safeguard, and tells the villagers that it is possible to produce more of the rations by going to a nearby 'automated factory'.
Heeding her words, a group of villagers including Kae and Zuru travel to the automated factory in search of more rations. Arriving there, Cibo assists in logging into the system and produces a large amount of rations, much to the delight of the villagers. However, right after she produces a machine for Killy, the system rejects her log-in and builds multiple Exterminators to eliminate the villagers. Cibo, who remakes herself using the system in a cyborg form, leads the villagers, with Kae now having broken her arm, to a railway car and escapes back to the village. During the ride, Killy is knocked unconscious trying to save the villagers.
Arriving at the village, the villagers celebrate at the sudden amount of food. While holding the celebration, Cibo secretly wakes Killy up with only Zuru as a witness and leads him down towards the shield generator with the machine. While heading down, Kae takes her gun to the observatory platform and shoots the shield generator, whereupon it is revealed that she had been converted into a cyborg representative for the Safeguard back at the factory. Sanakan, as she now calls herself, proceeds to kill multiple villagers, deeming them illegal residents.
Killy, realising what has occurred, runs back up to the village on his own. Cibo travels further down at a faster pace, where she sets the machine right next to the destroyed Shield Generator and connects herself to it. Back at the top, Sanakan is killing residents, but the village elders frantically lead the rest of the villagers to the top of the village where they resist her using their remaining weapons. Killy himself enters combat with Sanakan, who after knocking him down, notes that he is a body 'stolen from the Safeguard'. Killy is saved at the last minute by Zuru, who throws his gun to him; which he shoots and destroys Sanakan, but not before Sanakan destroys Cibo.
Cibo, in an alternate dimension, pleads with the Authority, which controls the Safeguard, to let the villagers go. Unable to do so, they allow her to edit their base of levels of the City, which disconnects the level below the village from Safeguard control.
Cibo, now functioning through her only remaining arm, leads the remaining villagers to a trans-level railway car, but right after the villagers get in, an observatory tower spots them. Killy throws the device which has been keeping him safe from the Safeguard to Zuru, upon which he says that he still wants to find the NetControl Gene, which enables human control of the Safeguard. The villagers are then able to escape.
At the end, Zuru's granddaughter narrates that the village still lives in the level below to this day, still waiting for Killy to find the Gene. She then says that Zuru still talks about Killy, to the point that he sounds like the last hope for humanity."

He (Glenn Arias) is on a mission of vengeance against the U.S. government for killing his family, friends, and wife in a drone strike at their wedding. Chris and his fellow agents infiltrate a mansion in Mexico, after Cathy White, their undercover source who followed Arias's organization vanished along with her son, Zack. Inside the mansion, Chris's fellow agents are ambushed by aggressive zombies (Zack included) and death traps, with Chris being the sole survivor and barely making it out alive. Chris then comes face-to-face with Arias outside the mansion and engages him in close quarters combat only to be swiftly defeated. He then finds out that Cathy has become a zombie, who now obeys Arias. As Arias leaves with his associates, Maria and Diego Gomez, the BSAA arrives just in time to rescue Chris by slaughtering Cathy and the remaining zombie horde with Chris vowing revenge on Arias. Meanwhile, Professor Rebecca Chambers, former S.T.A.R.S. unit member and survivor of the Mansion incident, studies a new virus coined the ""Animality Virus""—""A-Virus"" for short—that is capable of laying dormant inside any individual until the right trigger is presented. She identifies three components to the virus: the base virus, the trigger virus, and the vaccine. The research labs are soon attacked by Maria who works for Arias and who releases the virus via aerosol form. While her colleagues quickly turn into zombies, Rebecca is able to formulate a vaccine that she administers on herself, immediately rendering herself immune to the gas. After fending off some zombies, Rebecca is then rescued by Chris, who briefs her on Arias's plan and motives.
Rebecca recognizes the zombies' loyalty to the host and makes a connection to Las Plagas, the bioweapon used by the Los Illuminados, and theorizes that the remaining members of the cult are providing information to Arias in developing the A-Virus. Both identify the need for an expert on the matter and make contact with DSO agent Leon S. Kennedy in Colorado. But Leon, drinking his sorrows away, is hesitant to join their mission after his fellow officers were ambushed and turned into zombies from receiving poor intel about Los Illuminados. Chris and Rebecca try to get Leon on board the mission, but the trio is soon attacked by Maria and Diego. They succeed in capturing Rebecca, while Chris and Leon, who finally agrees to help, team up to plan a rescue operation and decrypt Arias's plan of a large-scale attack on New York City.
Arias intends to make Rebecca his bride as she shares a striking resemblance to his late wife. It is also revealed here that Diego and Maria are father and daughter, and close friends of Arias who also survived the wedding massacre. He develops a new strain of the A-Virus that is not affected by the vaccine and injects it into Rebecca. Arias then challenges Chris to rescue Rebecca within twenty minutes, after which the virus will take full effect on Rebecca. As Arias's associates initiate their attack on New York City by releasing the gas form of the virus via tankers, Leon and Chris's new BSAA team—D.C., Damian, and Nadia—manage to destroy the vehicles, contain the virus and incapacitate Maria in the process, although Damian is brutally decapitated by zombie dogs in the process. Chris then infiltrates Arias's safe house, defeats Diego and rescues Rebecca. On the terrace, he is confronted by Arias, and a brutal gun-kata and close quarters fight ends with Arias falling through the glass terrace below to his demise. Diego then arrives and, despite being badly injured after being defeated by Chris, merges with Arias to form a new Tyrant monster. Chris is no match against the Tyrant until Leon joins the fight after working his way through the safehouse, mowing down zombies. With the assistance of D.C. and Nadia, they manage to trap the Tyrant, at which point Chris finishes it off with a grenade launcher. They are then able to locate the antidote that Arias kept and cure Rebecca just before the twenty minutes run out before escaping by helicopter, wondering what may lie ahead.
The epilogue features Maria being alive and vowing vengeance for her father's and Arias's deaths."

Mary and the Witch's Flower,"A fire burns as workers struggle to control it. A red-haired girl slips away with a satchel slung on her wrist, but is quickly seen and followed. A group of workers transforms into watery, bird-like creatures, who pursue the girl in the air as she escapes via a flying broomstick.
However, a large, bright-blue explosion envelops the creatures, and the girl falls off the broomstick, her satchel opening upon impact. The small seeds inside drop to the forest floor, causing trees to rapidly grow, and young birds to mature to adulthood and fly away. The broomstick is also quickly swallowed up by the growing foliage.
- Young Mary Smith moves into the British estate of her Great Aunt Charlotte ahead of her parents. The bored, friendless girl tries to make herself useful through chores, but she repeatedly creates messes in the process. A local boy named Peter teases her for both her clumsiness and her wild red hair, which she hates.
Tib and Gib, Peter's cats, lead Mary to some mysterious glowing flowers. Zebedee, the estate gardener, identifies the flowers as ""fly-by-night""; legend has it that witches covet the flower for its magical power. The next day, Gib disappears and Mary follows Tib to go look for her. Tib leads her to a broomstick ensnared in a tree's roots. Mary frees the broomstick, but accidentally bursts a fly-by-night bulb on it. The bulb releases magical power in the form of a blue gelatinous substance, making the broomstick come to life and enabling Mary to ride it like a witch. The Little Broomstick whisks Mary and Tib away to a complex of buildings hidden in the clouds. Flanagan, a fox creature who looks after student's broomsticks, scolds her for crash-landing her broomstick and tells her she's at the Endor College for witches.
The headmistress Madame Mumblechook assumes Mary is a new pupil with Tib as her familiar, and takes her on a tour of the college. The tour reveals a campus with modern technology and conveniences, wherein witches take courses in the magic arts alongside fields of science such as chemistry. During the tour Madame introduces Mary to Doctor Dee, the College's renowned chemistry teacher. Mary finds herself able to perform advanced spells such as invisibility. Madame and Doctor Dee become convinced that Mary is a prodigy, because of her performance as well as her red hair, which turns out be a distinguishing feature among the best witches.
At Madame's office, Mary finds a spell book hidden behind a picture of fly-by-night. Mary admits that her magical ability comes from fly-by-night, and that Tib actually belongs to Peter. Madame's attitude to Mary suddenly changes, but she still lets Mary return home. The magic granted to Mary by the flower ends as the sun sets and Mary barely makes it home safely. That night, Madame sends a message to Mary informing her that she's kidnapped Peter, and demands that Mary turn the fly-by-night bulbs to her. She and Tib fly back to Endor with the bulbs and Mary leaves the Little Broomstick by the school entrance. Madame and Doctor Dee imprison her and steal the bulbs, locking her in Doctor Dee's transformation spell lab. Mary finds Peter locked in the lab with her, and discovers Doctor Dee has been experimenting on animals transforming them into fantastic creatures, including Gib. In the spell book, Mary finds a spell that can undo all magic, and uses it to undo all the transformations and unlock the lab. As they try to escape, they find themselves cornered on a balcony, only for Flanagan to return the Little Broomstick, scolding Mary for leaving it lying around anywhere. They then try to escape, but Madame and Doctor Dee recapture Peter.
The Little Broomstick takes Mary to an isolated cottage. Within the cottage, Mary finds notes on transformation spells and a mirror that Great Aunt Charlotte uses to contact her. Charlotte reveals that the cottage was her previous home, and she used to be a red haired pupil that excelled at Endor (the one from the introduction). But one day Charlotte found fly-by-night on the campus, leading Madame and Doctor Dee to obsessively pursue a project to use the flower to transform all humans into witches. When one of their experiments disastrously failed, Charlotte decided to escape Endor, taking the flower with her. Charlotte begs Mary to use her last bulbs to return home, but Mary vows to rescue Peter instead.
As Mary attempts to return to Endor, Madame gives chase, demanding the spell book back. An aerial chase ensues, in which the book is stolen and Mary falls onto the island where the lab is. The Little Broomstick breaks and the magic of the flower runs out. Mary makes her way across the island where the lab is and finds Madame and Doctor Dee are trying to use the flower to transform Peter into a witch. The experiment fails again, leaving Peter trapped within a gelatinous monster that rampages across the lab, draining the magic of all in its path. Mary gets the spell book from Madame after she is drained and tries to break the enchantments on a canister to reach the last fly-by-night bulb. If she can regain her magic she can undo the spell binding Peter. She fails to reach it but realizes Peter can use magic now, and takes Peter's hand from within the monster and gives him the book with the spell to undo magic, allowing him to activate it. It undos the failed experiment as well as all of Madame and Doctor Dee's research relating to it. The lab is destroyed.
Mary awakens in the ruins of the lab, which has been completely grown over. Flanagan returns her broomstick to her, having repaired it, and scolds her for leaving her broomstick lying wherever she wants. The two take the Broomstick back home, but while flying, Peter sees a Witch's Flower bulb in her hair. She throws it away, stating she doesn't need magic anymore. The last bulb of the flower explodes in midair, no longer needed, presumably ending the Witch's Flower.
In the credits, Mary is shown to be back home, on her way to school with Peter. The Little Broomstick is shown leaning against the wall at the manor, home."
Gintama,"Yorozuya receives two similar and ultimately connected jobs: Elizabeth needs Odd Jobs to find Katsura, and a swordsmith needs the crew to find a dangerous sword named Benizakura. There is more to both requests than Gintoki and his friends thought."
Pokémon the Movie 20: I Choose You!,"Ash Ketchum wakes up late one morning after having broken his alarm clock in his sleep. He eventually makes it to Professor Oak's lab, but is told that the three starter Pokémon (Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander) have already been taken by Trainers who were on time. However, Oak reveals that he has one more Pokémon, an Electric-type named Pikachu. Despite its volatile and feisty personality, as well as its refusal to get inside a Poké Ball, Ash happily takes Pikachu for his journey.
Outside of Pallet Town, Ash encounters a Pidgey. When Pikachu refuses to fight it, Ash tosses a rock at it, but it hits a Spearow that mistakes Pikachu as the culprit. Soon, more Spearow show up forcing Ash and Pikachu to run. Injured and tired, Ash tells Pikachu to get inside its Ball, but it once again refuses. Instead, Pikachu defends Ash from the Spearow by summoning a large Thunderbolt that scares them away. As the storm ceases, a Ho-Oh flies above and drops a feather called a Rainbow Wing. Ash and Pikachu decide to go and find the Legendary Pokémon.
During their travels, Ash catches a Caterpie and the group eventually settle at a Pokémon Center. A Trainer bursts in claiming that they encountered an Entei, a Legendary Fire-type Pokémon, causing Ash, as well as several other Trainers, to rush into the woods to look for it. Ash finds the Entei, but ends up fighting over it with a Trainer with a Piplup named Verity. They are also joined by an aspiring young Pokémon Professor named Sorrel who uses a Lucario in battle. When Entei escapes, Ash and Verity get into an argument and Sorrel leaves, telling them that they need to find shelter soon. As Ash and Verity fight, they accidentally disturb an Onix that starts chasing them. They manage to get it to leave just as it begins to rain. As they look to find shelter, they find a Charmander that has been left out. They quickly learn that it belongs to a ruthless trainer named Cross who, along with his Midnight form Lycanroc, left it out in the rain. He carelessly refuses to take it back, calling it weak, and Ash and Verity are forced to find it shelter.
They come across a cave where Sorrel and Lucario happen to be and help Charmander back to health. Entei and several other Pokémon arrive to sleep for the night and Ash reveals the Rainbow Wing. Sorrel reveals that Ho-Oh only gives the Wing to the ""rainbow hero"" who is destined to fight it, as a shadow Pokémon named Marshadow watches. The next morning, Ash convinces Charmander to join them. The group venture on with Caterpie evolving into a Metapod, and Charmander evolving into Charmeleon. Sorrel studies more about Ho-Oh and the Legendary Pokémon while Verity spots a Suicune. Eventually, while battling other Trainers in town, Cross returns and challenges Ash's Charmeleon with his Incineroar. Charmeleon is savagely defeated, causing Ash much grief.
Upset over his loss, Ash openly admits that he could have won with Pikachu and later states that he wished he had gotten Bulbasaur or Squirtle. Alone in the woods, Marshadow puts Ash in a sleep-like state as the Rainbow Wing turns dark. Ash has a dream where no Pokémon exist and he attends regular school with Verity and Sorrel. Realizing something is missing, he remembers Pikachu and wakes up to his friends, and the Wing regains its color. After escaping some angry Primeape, Metapod evolves into Butterfree. They rescue a pink Butterfree from a Fearow and realize that Ash's Butterfree needs to mate. Saddened but happy, Ash lets his Butterfree go. The group soon spot a Raikou and realize they are getting close when the Wing begins to glow in the direction of Mount Tensei.
The group make it there and meet Bonji, an old researcher who has been studying Ho-Oh. They make it to a crystal-like structure, but are interrupted by Cross who wants to fight Ho-Oh himself (he too saw Ho-oh, but it did not give him the Wing). Cross' Incineroar fights Ash's Charmeleon which quickly evolves into Charizard and defeats Incineroar. Cross, refusing to accept his loss, grabs the Wing and places it on the crystal, but it turns dark, causing Marshadow, as arceus agent, to turn the local Pokémon (including Cross's midnight form Lycanroc) evil and attack Ash and his friends. The Trainers fight back, but are overwhelmed by the severity of the situation. Ash finally forces Pikachu to get in his Poké Ball as the Pokémon destroy Ash, turning him into pure energy as Marshadow notices the Wing has disintegrated.
Ash finds himself in a grey world, but is brought back, presumably through Ho-Oh's power when Ash protected Pikachu. Ash takes the newly formed Rainbow Wing and places it on the crystal structure. Ho-Oh arrives and Ash challenges it with Pikachu to battle, but the outcome is never shown. The gang return to the Pokémon Center as Bonji states that Ho-Oh will find a new trainer to leave its Wing to. Cross leaves on good terms with the group and eventually Verity and Sorrel leave to achieve their own dreams. Ash and Pikachu decide to continue their journey in the world of Pokémon.
During the credits, Ash's recurring friends from the main series (Brock, Misty, Tracey, May, Max, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Clemont, Bonnie and Serena) are shown. Verity is seen returning home, presumably to amend her relationship with her mother, and Sorrel is seen traveling and spotting an Articuno that he wanted to study. Ash and Pikachu are seen traveling together while being tailed by Team Rocket who appeared throughout the film, unnoticed by the protagonists for comic relief."

The Anthem of the Heart,"The story revolves around a girl named Jun Naruse, a chatterbox. One day she sees her father come out from one love hotel with another woman and tells her mother, resulting in her parents' divorce. Her father blames her, saddening Jun. While she is crying, a fairy egg appears and seals her words so she won't hurt people again.
When Jun is in high school, as the result of the ""curse"", Jun is unable to speak. Her homeroom teacher, Kazuki Jōshima, signs her up to Charity Committee members along with three other people: Takumi Sakagami, Natsuki Nitō, and Daiki Tasaki. Going to the committee room to properly reject becoming a committee member, Jun hears Takumi singing and is captivated. She then tells Takumi of her past and requests him to turn her words into a song, thinking that the curse won't apply if she's singing.
Jun, Takumi, and Natsuki decide to hold a musical performance, something that Daiki refuses as he mocks Jun for being unable to talk, but Jun proves herself by singing in front of the class. They decide to do a musical based on Jun's experience in the form of a fairy tale. While discussing the musical, Daiki has a falling out with his teammates that is stopped by Jun, who consequently has another stomachache for talking, but this improves her bonds with Takumi, Natsuki, and Daiki. Misunderstanding Takumi's concern for Jun as a sign that he is falling in love with her, Natsuki tells Takumi that she will cheer them on despite her own feelings for Takumi.
The next day, Daiki makes amends with his teammates. As they spend time together preparing for the musical, Jun starts to develop feelings for Takumi, while Daiki starts to develop feelings for Jun. Daiki asks Takumi regarding his relationship with Natsuki, having heard rumours that both of them were dating during middle school, but Takumi denies this since Natsuki had told her classmates then that they were not dating when she was asked. At the night before the musical, Takumi asks Natsuki about the boy she's dating currently, leading Natsuki to finally reveal that the boy she's referring to is none other than Takumi himself, before she accuses him of falling in love with Jun. Takumi reveals that while he is concerned about Jun, he is not in love with her and he has always regretted not trying to convey his feelings for Natsuki during middle school even when he was aware of her feelings for him at that time. Unbeknownst to them, Jun overhears their conversation. Heartbroken, she runs away and meets the fairy egg, who reveals that she has worsened the curse by trying to convey her feelings for Takumi. Jun doesn't show up on the day of the musical, leaving Natsuki to fill her role while Takumi frantically goes searching for her.
Takumi finds Jun at the love hotel that has been shut down. To his surprise, she is able to talk normally. Jun angrily lashes out at Takumi as he tells her that the reason she is unable to convey her words is not because of the fairy egg's curse but because of Jun's own fear. Wanting to hear her voice once more, Takumi allows Jun to lash out all of her anger and frustration until she is satisfied. Jun confesses her feelings for Takumi, but it is revealed that Takumi is still in love with Natsuki, to which Jun replies that she knew. Takumi then expresses his gratitude for Jun because before he met her, he was unable to say what he truly felt properly and only went along with everyone else. This convinces Jun to perform in the musical. Jun and Takumi arrives just in time before the final scene, allowing Jun to sing and convey her feelings to her mother who finally understands what she had been through. As the musical ends, Jun realises that the fairy egg was actually nothing but an imagination that she created to have someone she could blame for her condition, and now she decides to open up her heart, coming to terms with her past.
As the movie ends, Takumi and Natsuki reconciles their relationship, while Daiki finally confesses his feelings to Jun."

Fate/kaleid liner Prisma Illya: Oath Under Snow,"A young Shirou Emiya and his adoptive father Kiritsugu travel to Fuyuki in order to investigate the Sakatsuki family, who are rumored to be harboring a child with powerful magic abilities. However, they arrive to find the city engulfed in a massive black vortex which is banished by a mysterious light. They enter the ruins of the city where they find and rescue Miyu, the child they are looking for. Kiritsugu explains that Miyu has the power to grant wishes unconditionally, and that the storm was most likely caused when she was inadvertently exposed to humans thoughts and desires. Kiritsugu declares that he will use her power to save humanity. Shirou and Kiritsugu take Miyu back to their home, where Kiritsugu makes it clear to Shirou that they should only consider her a tool and not a human. Regardless, Shirou begins to bond with Miyu and Kiritsugu passes away before he can learn how to use Miyu's powers.
Five years later, Shirou is living as a regular high school student with Miyu as his adopted younger sister and attends school with his classmates Julian and Sakura. During this, it appears that Miyu's powers have disappeared with age as Kiritsugu had originally feared. Shirou decides it's finally time to let Miyu experience the world outside their home, with Miyu saying she wants to see the ocean. Feeling guilt for his past actions, he takes her to the ruins of her original family's home where he admits that he and Kiritsugu originally took her in to exploit her powers, not save her. Julian then arrives, telling Shirou that he had been looking for Miyu for the past five years in order to finish the ritual he had started. Shirou realizes that Julian was the cause of the vortex that consumed Fuyuki and attempts to protect Miyu, but is easily defeated by Julian and his followers and left for dead while Miyu is kidnapped.
Shirou then wakes up in the care of a local priest, Kirei Kotomine. Kirei explains that Julian is part of the Ainsworth family, an ancient family of mages who foresaw the end of humanity and sought to obtain the wish granting Holy Grail to avert it. However, their four past attempts to obtain it in a ritual called the Holy Grail War ended in failure, with the Fourth Grail War resulting in the vortex that destroyed much of Fuyuki. However, this time, Julian plans to use Miyu as a sacrifice to start the Fifth Grail War. Kirei tells Shirou where Julian's hideout is, but Shirou is unable to penetrate its magical defenses. Sakura then visits him and informs him that the Fifth Grail War has started, and the participants have been given special Servant Cards that can imbue them with the power of a Heroic Spirit. She offers one to Shirou to give him a way to rescue Miyu, but admits that she would rather see him leave the city and not get involved in the War due to her feelings for him. They are then attacked by her older brother Shinji, who holds the Assassin Card. Sakura is killed and Shirou uses her Archer Card to empower himself and kill Shinji, who is revealed to merely be a puppet sent by Julian.
With his Archer Card, Shirou begins hunting down the other Servant Card holders and killing them, who are all revealed to be Julian's puppets as well. Julian observes Shirou's progress along with Miyu, who now only sees herself as a tool to be used and does nothing to stop Julian's plans. Kirei congratulates Shirou for winning the Fifth Grail War and directs him to an ancient cave where Miyu is being held. Julian confonts Shirou and tries to talk him out of taking Miyu back, explaining how she is a necessary sacrifice to save humanity. Shirou counters by pointing out that for all four hundred years of their existence, the Sakatsuki family never used their wish granting powers for personal gain, but only to wish for their children to grow up healthy.
Shirou continues on and finally reunites with Miyu. He decides to use his wish to send Miyu to a different world where she can find happiness. As the wish takes effect, Shirou confronts the holder of the real Archer Card. Having used his Card to make his wish, Shirou is forced to fight the real Archer with his own abilities. While Shirou is eventually overpowered and defeated, he manages to buy enough time for the ritual to complete and Miyu is transported away.
Miyu then wakes up in an alternate Fuyuki that has not been ravaged by disaster, where she meets Star Sapphire, Magical Ruby, Rin Tohsaka, Luviagelita Edelfelt, and Illyasviel von Einzbern for the first time."

The take-over could not have taken place without the move of Otomo as a former lieutenant of the Sanno-kai with his loyal followers to join the Hanabishi-kai in making their power move against the Sanno-kai. Now that the Hanabishi-kai have succeeded in the take-over, they decide that the former Sanno-kai followers who assisted them have become expendable and start to eliminate them one-by-one. When Otomo sees this, he determines that his best chances are to accept a previous offer to join one of the powerful Korean crime organizations and he leaves Japan to accept the offer of Mr. Chang to go to the resort island of Jeju in South Korea.

Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel Series,"When Shirou was seven years old, a devastating fire that destroyed Fuyuki City left him orphaned and mentally traumatized. He was rescued and adopted by Kiritsugu Emiya, a mysterious magic user who later inspired Shirou to pursue his ultimate goal to become a ""Hero of Justice"". When Kiritsugu passed away, his friend and neighbor Taiga Fujimura became Shirou's guardian. Shirou grew up to be the star of his high school's archery team alongside Shinji Matou, until an injury sidelines him. Around that time, Shinji's sister Sakura befriends Shirou and starts to regularly visit him at his home. This ultimately causes a rift between Shirou and Shinji, but over the course of 18 months, Sakura nevertheless forms a close bond with Shirou and Taiga. Shirou's simple life with Sakura and Taiga suddenly becomes upended when he has a violent encounter with a blue-clad warrior with super human strength, wielding a red spear. He is revived from imminent death, and later accidentally summons Saber, an armored swordswoman, who goes on to protect him from the spearman and drive him off and then defeat another superpowered foe, Archer, nearly killing him in the process. However, Archer turns out to be under the service of Rin Tohsaka, a school acquaintance of Shirou. Noting that Shirou is utterly clueless regarding the current situation, Rin declares a temporary truce and takes Shirou and Saber to see Kirei Kotomine, a brooding priest at a nearby church.
Kirei explains to Shirou that he is now entangled in a deadly conflict between magi that occurs in Fuyuki every few decades called the Holy Grail War -- a battle royale to claim an ancient, magical artifact that is said to grant a wish to the victor. Each of the seven chosen magi that becomes a participant, or Master, is given the responsibility and protection of a single Servant, which takes the form of a powerful hero of legend. He also explains to Shirou that Kiritsugu himself was a Master in the previous war, but he inexplicably ordered his Servant (the Saber-class hero whom Shirou now commands) to destroy the Holy Grail, causing the catastrophic fire that devastated Fuyuki and orphaned Shirou. Resolved to prevent any other mage with evil intentions from claiming the Grail, Shirou resolves to remain a Master and confirms his pact with Saber.
En route back home, Shirou and Rin encounter Illyasviel von Einzbern, a mysterious white-haired girl. She attacks Shirou with her giant Servant Berserker. Saber intervenes but begins to lose badly against the enraged enemy. Unable to watch Saber be killed, Shirou leaps into the fray and is nearly cleaved in half by Berserker's assault. Disappointed by the conclusion of the battle, Illya recalls Berserker and leaves Shirou to die. Later, Shirou wakes up with his wounds healing, which Rin reveals to be a form of magical healing coming from Shirou himself. Saber dissuades Shirou from risking his life in the future, explaining that his death means that Saber would die anyway. Rin and Shirou go their separate ways, with Rin making clear to Shirou that they are both participants of the War, and only one of them will survive in the end.
Despite Rin's warnings to stay away from her at school, Shirou confronts Rin about the news of citizens suddenly falling ill and dying. Rin agrees that they should set aside their participation in the War until they find the cause of the disruption and once again forms a temporary truce with Shirou. Shirou insists that Sakura stays at his home, hoping to keep her safe with Saber. Sakura accepts his offer and stays at the Emiya residence for the time being.
Some time later, Shirou and Saber run into Shinji, who reveals himself as the Master of Rider, a purple-haired Servant with a mask concealing her eyes. Confident of his victory due to Shirou hardly being trained as a magus, Shinji hastily orders Rider to attack Saber. However, Saber proves to be the far superior combatant and defeats Rider in a single blow, seemingly killing her. In a panic, Shinji attempts to flee, but is stopped by the sudden appearance of his grandfather Zouken, who admonishes Shinji for his failure. Shinji, distraught and angered by his humiliation at Shirou's hands, bitterly leaves the scene.
At the nearby Ryuudou Temple, the Servant Assassin stands guard, but is suddenly killed by an entity emerging from within himself. This dark figure goes on to kill Souichirou Kuzuki, a teacher at Shirou's high school, and his Servant Caster, revealing himself to be the Heroic Spirit meant to be the ""True"" Assassin. A shadow arrives soon after and devours Caster's body.
Shirou begins to notice bruises on Sakura's body. When Shinji arrives and strikes his sister, Shirou nearly attacks Shinji, but Sakura implores him to stop. Shirou complies and lets Shinji leave. When Souichirou never returns to school, Rin confirms her suspicions about his identity as a Master and she and Shirou investigate the matter further. They encounter Zouken, but the tense stand-off is interrupted by the sudden arrival of a shadowy figure that shocks even the old man. The shadow attempts to swallow Rin, but Shirou pushes Rin out of the way. While he is injured, the shadow retreats.
Kirei meets with Shirou to discuss the mysterious circumstances of the current Holy Grail War. He admits that he had his ambitions, but those must be cast aside as the shadow's actions prove to be a grave threat to the entire city. Shirou declines Kirei's invitation to work together. The blue spearman, Lancer, is ordered by Kirei to track down the new Assassin. After an intense duel spanning across the city, Lancer overwhelms Assassin, but is defeated by Assassin's Noble Phantasm Zabaniya and the assistance of the shadow. The shadow devours Lancer while he laments the bleakness of the situation.
Shirou and Saber go to investigate Ryuudou Temple, where Souichirou was killed. There, they find True Assassin, who attacks Saber. Assassin draws Saber away in a duel, while Zouken corners Shirou and attacks him with Crest Worms. Saber is trapped between Assassin's fatal attack and the encroaching shadow, unable to break free. Shirou finds that his Command Seals, the marks on his hand indicating him to be a Master, are now gone, signifying Saber's death. He momentarily breaks free from Zouken's assault, intriguing the old magus, but Assassin returns and attacks Shirou, while Zouken leaves them to their battle. Hopelessly outmatched, Shirou nears defeat, but is suddenly saved by Rider, who appears out of thin air. Displaying speed and strength she did not possess during the previous fight, she handily defeats Assassin and drives him away. Rider confirms that Shirou will live and leaves him confused about her intentions. As he departs the temple, Shirou finds himself face-to-face with the shadow, but the shadow disappears without harming him.
Battered, defeated, and having just failed Saber, Shirou returns home and finds Sakura waiting for him in the snow. She displays her concern over him continually returning in an injured state, but Shirou consoles her and the two come back inside -- for Shirou is no longer a Master and can no longer fight.
However, Saber is revealed to have survived, having chosen to be devoured by the shadow rather than killed by Assassin. Within the shadow, she reaches for a light, but she is discouraged by a familiar voice; she turns and is greeted by an altered image of herself, with deathly pale skin, ominous amber eyes, and a black dress."
Yowamushi Pedal: Re:GENERATION!,"Sakamichi Onoda is an otaku who has just entered high school.

Also known as Europa United in Akito the Exiled). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or ""Knightmare Frame"". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia. Lelouch has one sister, Nunnally vi Britannia.

After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.

Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called C.C. (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as Geass (ギアス, Giasu). This power, also known as the ""Power of Kings"" (王の力, Ō no Chikara), allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf. This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named Kallen Stadtfeld, the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world."

My Teacher,"Second year high school student and archery enthusiast Hibiki Shimada has never felt romantic love all her life. This comes despite befriending Megumi Chigusa and Kosuke Kawai, two lovestruck teenagers who shamelessly flaunt their feelings for the school's mathematics and visual arts teachers, Masato Sekiya and Sachiko Nakajima, respectively.
One day, Hibiki wrongly sends Chigusa's love letter for Sekiya to Kosaku Ito, the school's history teacher. Volunteering to take it back, she ends up becoming attracted to him. Days after their meeting, Hibiki is further fascinated by Ito's kindness, as he is well-known among the school as a stern and cold person. Ito takes Hibiki to a hospital when he spots her limping with a wounded leg, helps her finish an assignment after hours, and frequently gives her a ride home. Meanwhile, Chigusa quietly drops her romantic pursuit when she finds out that Sekiya is in love with Nakajima. However, Hibiki and Kosuke learn shortly after that Nakajima is in love with Ito when they overhear her confession to Ito, who rejects her.
Eventually, Hibiki professes her love to Ito before the finals. She makes a deal with him: if she manages to score over 90 in the history test, he will allow her to love him. Along the way, Hibiki is discouraged from reaching her goal by Nakajima and Ito himself. She regains her spirit after a pep talk with Yusuke Fujioka, an archery student from a neighboring school. Her efforts bear fruit when the test results are out. During the cultural festival, she approaches Ito in a wedding dress and pledges that she will love him forever. Unexpectedly, Ito kisses her. The next day, words of the kiss spread among the school. Hibiki is suspended, while Ito is called for disciplinary action. When the two meet later, Ito decides to end their relationship. Dejectedly walking home, Hibiki is comforted by Fujioka, who confesses his feelings for her.
The result of the disciplinary meeting is announced the next day: Ito will leave his post. As she is still suspended, Hibiki does not learn about it until Chigusa hurriedly goes to her home and pleads her to meet with him one last time. Kosuke, angry at Ito's halfheartedness, gives him a tongue lashing about abandoning Hibiki, asking him whether the words he said at the disciplinary meeting — that he sincerely loves Hibiki — were lies. Each encouraged, Hibiki and Ito race for a final meeting, where Ito promises to wait until Hibiki's graduation for them to begin a relationship.
Around one and a half year later, Hibiki graduates. Chigusa has found love in an underclassman, while Kosuke is still attempting to woo Nakajima, this time as an adult. As she is walking home, Hibiki is greeted by Ito."

"Gekijōban Haikara-san ga Tōru Zenpen ~Benio, Hana no 17-sai~","The haikara of the title is Benio Hanamura (voiced by: Keiko Yokozawa, known as Anne or Marie in European dub versions of the anime), a 17-year-old schoolgirl in Tokyo circa 1920 (during the Taishō era). Benio lost her mother when she was very young and has been raised by her father, a high-ranking official in the Japanese army. As a result, she has grown into a tomboy - contrary to traditional Japanese notions of femininity, she studies kendo, drinks sake, dresses in often outlandish-looking Western fashions instead of the traditional kimono, and isn't as interested in housework as she is in literature. She also rejects the idea of arranged marriages and believes in a woman's right to a career and to marry for love. Benio's best friends are the beautiful Tamaki (voiced by: Rihoko Yoshida), who is much more feminine than Benio but equally interested in women's rights, and Ranmaru (voiced by: Kazuko Sugiyama), a young man who was raised to play female roles in the kabuki theater and as a result has acquired very effeminate mannerisms.
One day, Benio has a series of embarrassing encounters with the handsome army lieutenant Shinobu Ijuin (voiced by: Katsuji Mori). Shinobu witnesses Benio crash into a tree and fall while riding her bicycle, and Benio slaps him for laughing at her. Later, Shinobu also rescues Benio when she falls from a tree while flying a kite. Benio encounters Shinobu again when she arrives home that day, and promptly attacks him with her kendo stick, only to receive a shock when her father (voiced by: Ichiro Nagai) tells her that Shinobu is to be her husband, due to a pact made between the Hanamura and Ijuin families before Benio's birth. Shinobu (who is of mixed Japanese and German ancestry) wishes to fulfill the dream of his grandmother, who once fell in love with a man of the Hanamura family but was unable to marry him because of the difference in their social standings. In keeping with her feminist ideals, Benio flatly refuses and even attempts to elope with Ranmaru, but is caught when she becomes involved in a brawl at a local tavern. Since Benio's friend Tamaki is in love with Shinobu, Benio also wants out of the engagement to avoid hurting Tamaki. Benio finally agrees to move into Shinobu's household to learn how to be a good wife, according to Japanese custom.
Initially, Benio's plan is to purposely err in her wifely duties in every way imaginable, from cooking badly to embarrassing her fiance in public, in the hopes that his family will cancel the engagement. Benio frequently argues with Shinobu's grandfather and is a constant irritant to the family's strict governmess. Ranmaru even moves into the Ijuin house and poses as Benio's personal maid. However, her scheme fails - Shinobu genuinely loves Benio and patiently forgives her for her many blunders, and Benio soon realizes that in spite of herself, she is also falling in love with him. However, a major in the army who holds a grudge against Shinobu then sends the young lieutenant to fight in Manchuria.
Benio stays on in the Ijuin home to care for Shinobu's grandparents and wait for his return. She cuts her waist-length hair short and decides to get a job to help out with the family's dire financial situation. After a failed try as a geisha, Benio becomes a reporter for a small local newspaper and convinces her misogynistic boss, Tosei (who is allergic to women because of his hatred of his mother, but somehow appears to be immune to Benio), to send her to Manchuria to cover the war. Once in China, she learns that Shinobu is missing in action and feared dead. Heartbroken, Benio attempts suicide (by trying to drown herself first in a bowl of water, and then in a jar of sake, which only results in her getting drunk), but is convinced to return to Japan and move on with her life.
Some time later, Benio is assigned to cover the visit of a Russian noble couple to Tokyo. She notices how much the count looks like Shinobu, and Shinobu's army friend Onijima (voiced by: Yoshito Yasuhara) proves Benio's hunch to be true. Unfortunately for Benio, Shinobu is suffering from amnesia and believes himself to be the husband of the countess Lalissa. Lalissa's sad story complicates the situation even more - she lost her previous husband who was actually Shinobu's half-brother who resembles him and shared the same mother and is herself dying of tuberculosis. In addition, the Ijuin mansion is about to be repossessed - until a mysterious good Samaritan steps in to pay the mortgage on the mansion. The mystery benefactor is in fact Benio's boss, Tosei. Moved by this unexpected show of kindness, Benio decides to forget Shinobu and accept Tosei's proposal of marriage. Meanwhile, Benio's friend Tamaki has fallen for Onijima, although the two try to deny their feelings since they are from different social classes.
Everything appears to be set in stone, until Benio and Tosei's wedding day, when the Kanto earthquake of 1923 rocks Tokyo and forces a bittersweet ending to the story. Lalissa is fatally injured in the quake trying to save Shinobu, and as she lies dying, she tells Shinobu to marry Benio and be happy. Shinobu, memories restored and himself severely injured, finds Benio amid the wreckage of the ruined city, and the two vow to never be separated from each other again. Tosei tries to save Benio, but Benio refuses, preferring to die alongside her beloved rather than face life without him; thus, Tosei rescues both Benio and Shinobu. In the end, Tosei comes to terms with his feelings about his mother and rededicates himself to his business; Onijima returns to Manchuria, and Tamaki decides to obey her heart and follow him; and Benio and Shinobu are wed at last."
Godzilla: Planet of the Monsters,"In the last summer of the 20th century, giant monsters began appearing all over the world and wreaking havoc. A powerful creature called Godzilla appeared which destroyed humans and monsters alike. Two species of aliens, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, arrived with the former attempting to convert humanity to their religion and the latter seeking to emigrate to Earth with promises to defeat Godzilla with Mechagodzilla, should humanity accept them. However, the Bilusaludo were unable to activate Mechagodzilla, which forced the aliens and humanity to abandon Earth and emigrate to Tau Ceti e.
20 years later and 11.9 light years away, Captain Haruo Sakaki locks himself in a shuttle, threatening to bomb the area unless the ship leaves Planet Tau-e and abandons the emigration project. Haruo believes the planet is uninhabitable and the emigration crew only consists of the elderly, including his grandfather, because he believes the ship's committee are trying to reduce the population due to limited resources. Haruo fails, is arrested and thrown in a cell where he witnesses the emigration shuttle exploding upon entering the planet.
Metphies, an Exif priest, visits Haruo, where he hands him classified data regarding Godzilla. Haruo anonymously publishes an essay detailing Godzilla's weak points, which convinces the central committee to return to Earth after concluding that finding another habitable planet seems unlikely. Upon returning to Earth, the ship sends recon drones to scout the Earth but reveal that Godzilla is still alive after all these years.
Metphies explains to the committee that they cannot co-exist with Godzilla and suggests killing it. He also explains that the anonymous essay was the result of a thorough investigation and is sound, promising to reveal the author under the condition that Haruo is released.
Haruo is released on bail and explains to the committee that a certain unknown organ in Godzilla's body can emit a high frequency electromagnetic pulse that generates an asymmetrical permeable shield. Haruo proposes shoving an EMP probe within the cracked organ before it regenerates so Godzilla can implode. However, Haruo stresses that close quarters combat would be needed for accurately coordinated attacks in order to find its weak organ, as well as 600 people.
The committee reluctantly accepts and upon landing two battalions on Earth, discovering that 20,000 years have passed and that Godzilla's presence has radically altered Earth's biosphere. They are attacked by a group of flying creatures called Servums and Leland, the company's commander, orders a retreat but Metphies stresses that they would need to rendezvous with Companies D and E through a pass where Godzilla frequents.
However, once the group mobilizes, they encounter Godzilla. Haruo proceeds with the original plan on his own and attacks Godzilla. Leland manages to provoke Godzilla to use its atomic breath, but at the cost of his life. Leland's actions reveal that Godzilla's weak point is its dorsal fins. Command falls to Metphies, who promotes Haruo to commander. In a speech, Haruo convinces the remaining survivors to continue with the plan and defeat Godzilla.
The group attacks Godzilla and manage to trap it within a collapsed mountain pass. EMP probes are drilled into Godzilla's dorsal fins which causes it to implode. Martin Lazzari, the group's environmental biologist, theorizes that this Godzilla may be different from the one that drove humanity away, believing it to be an offspring. Subsequently, the original Godzilla, which has grown several times larger, surfaces from beneath a nearby mountain and destroys the remaining crew. Trapped beneath rubble, Haruo watches Godzilla leave, vowing to kill it.
In a post-credits scene, Haruo wakes up in a secluded area, finding an indigenous girl next to him."

When the brothers commit the taboo act of Human Transmutation to resurrect Trisha after she dies of illness, it backfires and they suffer the consequences via the Law of Equivalent Exchange: Edward loses his left leg, while Alphonse is dragged into the Gate of Truth. Edward then sacrifices his right arm to save his brother's soul and bind it to a suit of armor via a blood seal, later replacing his missing limbs with ""automail"" prosthetics. Edward later receives an invitation by Colonel Roy Mustang to join the military so he can research a means of restoring Alphonse's body. After becoming a State Alchemist with the title ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", accompanied by their childhood friend and Automail mechanic Winry Rockwell, Edward begins his quest with Alphonse to find the legendary philosopher's stone which could repair their bodies.
Years later, Edward and Alphonse confront a cultist named Father Cornello, whom they believe is using a philosopher's stone to recruit the people of Liore. As Mustang arrives to personally handle the situation, Edward exposes Cornello while the stone is revealed to be a fake. After reaching East City and spending the night at the home of Major Maes Hughes and his pregnant wife, the brothers are provided with lodging when Major General Hakuro introduces them to Shou Tucker, a bio-alchemy authority who obtained his State Alchemist credentials by creating a talking chimera. As the brothers become fast friends with the man's young daughter Nina and their dog Alexander, Tucker suggests Edward to find Dr. Tim Marcoh as he created a philosopher's stone prior to going into hiding. Alphonse remains behind to be examined by Tucker, who causes Alphonse to question his existence, while Edward and Winry head to Marcoh's last known whereabouts.
Though Marcoh was murdered by Cornello's benefactor Lust as he and Winry find him, Edward acquires the man's notes and asks Hughes to decipher them while unknowingly alienating Alphonse to keep him safe. Hughes later makes a horrific discovery from his investigation and ends up being killed by Lust's associate Envy, who assumes Mustang's form to frame the colonel for the murder. Edward manages to escape being interrogated with help from Mustang's aide Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, using what he could deduce from the notes to investigate the clandestine Fifth Laboratory. At the same time, after revealing the new talking chimera that he created from Nina and Alexander, Tucker forces Alphonse and Winry to accompany him to the Fifth Laboratory, where they find Edward as he verbally realizes that the Philosopher's Stone is created from humans.
Tucker confirms Edward's realization, justifying their respective actions of selfishly manipulating life before Lust kills him while revealing herself as a homunculus. After Lust cryptically hints of her group's reach in the government and an upcoming event that Edward has a vital role in, Hakuro reveals the Mannequin Soldier homunculi and gets killed when he prematurely activates them. Mustang has Riza and their men keep the Mannequin Soldiers from flooding out of the laboratory while he confronts Lust and Envy, killing the former while ripping her philosopher's stone core from her body. While Mustang gives Edward the stone so he can restore Alphonse, Edward instead uses it to appear before his brother's body and promises to find another way to restore him. Edward then returns to his reality to reaffirm Alphonse's existence to him. Sometime after, as Gluttony mourns Lust's death, Envy is revealed to have survived Mustang's attack but has been diminished to its true parasitic form as a result."

Hardcore,"Waking inside a laboratory on an airship, a man recalls bullies from his childhood. A scientist, Estelle (Haley Bennett), greets him and says his name is Henry, she is his wife, and that he has been revived from an accident that left him amnesiac and mute. After she replaces a missing arm and leg with cybernetic prostheses, mercenaries led by the psychokinetic Akan (Danila Kozlovsky) raid the ship, claiming all of Estelle's research is Akan's corporate property. He kills Estelle's scientists before attempting to murder Henry, but Henry and Estelle flee in an escape pod, landing in Moscow. Estelle is abducted by the mercenaries, who try to kill Henry.
Henry is rescued by a mysterious man, Jimmy (Sharlto Copley), who informs him that his cybernetic implants are running out of power, which will kill him if he can't recharge. Jimmy is killed by corrupt cops bought out by Akan, and Henry is forced to fight his way through both cops and mercenaries, sneaking onto a bus. He is joined by Jimmy — not dead, now an alcoholic, odorous bum — who informs him that one of Akan's associates, Slick Dimitry, has a cybernetic charging pump implanted, which Henry needs to recharge. The two are attacked by a flamethrower-wielding goon. Jimmy is incinerated, but Henry escapes, locating and chasing Dimitry throughout Moscow before capturing him; just as Dimitry promises him information, he is killed by a sniper. Henry removes the pump and receives a call from Jimmy, who directs Henry to a brothel.
Henry meets two more versions of Jimmy — a cocaine-addicted lothario and a shy, awkward geek — who replace his pump. The brothel is attacked by Akan's forces. Henry fights his way through, but encounters Akan, who taunts him with Estelle's kidnapping, revealing she is being transported by an armored convoy. Akan hurls Henry out of the brothel.
Outside, Henry encounters another Jimmy — now a marijuana-obsessed hippie-biker — who transports him to Akan's convoy. Henry finds Estelle - and Akan, who (seemingly) kills him and buries him in the woods.
Jimmy finds and resuscitates Henry, only to be shelled by a tank. After killing the tank crew, fending off a helicopter, and failing to ride a runaway horse, Henry finds another Jimmy — a gruff sniper in a ghillie suit — who leads him to an abandoned hotel, where Jimmy is headquartered in a hidden laboratory. Jimmy and Henry encounter a number of policemen surrounding a girl. They are in the process of forcing her to perform oral sex on one of the cops. Henry kills them all. Here, the real Jimmy — a quadriplegic scientist — reveals his motive for helping Henry: revenge against Akan, who crippled him after his own cyborg super-soldiers failed. He reveals the other Jimmys are dormant clones that he can control, through which he lives a vice-filled life. The clones attack Henry after Jimmy realizes that Henry has been unknowingly broadcasting his location to Akan, with a strike force closing in. Fending off Jimmy, Henry convinces him to help. Henry and the clones of Jimmy — ranging from a punk rocker to a posh WWII Colonel — fight their way out, killing the force by collapsing the laboratory on them.
Jimmy and Henry drive to Akan's headquarters. They fight their way into an elevator, but Jimmy is mortally wounded. Before dying, Jimmy thanks Henry for being the closest thing to a friend he had, and removes a memory blocker, gradually restoring Henry's memories. Henry fights his way to the highest floor, where he is greeted by Akan, revealing an army of cyborg super-soldiers being fed Henry's memories. One such soldier fights Henry, followed by the rest of the army, chasing Henry to the roof.
Henry wipes out the entire army. Akan arrives and severely wounds Henry. Shortly after, Estelle arrives as well. In reality, Estelle was Akan's wife, forming an elaborate ruse to field-test Henry and use his memories to manipulate cyborg soldiers into doing anything to ""rescue"" their ""wife"" — specifically, terrorist attacks and world domination as Akan's loyal slaves. The two leave Henry for dead, leaving in a helicopter. Henry blacks out, but is energized by an emerging memory of his father (Tim Roth) encouraging him to fight back against the childhood bullies seen in the intro. Henry manages to reach Akan, decapitating him with his cybernetic eyestalk. He jumps onto Estelle's helicopter, presenting her Akan's head. Estelle shoots him, but the bullet ricochets off his cybernetic hand and wounds her, leaving her hanging from the helicopter. Estelle pleads with Henry to save her, but Henry slams the door, sending her falling to her death.
Mid-credits, an answering machine message from Jimmy is heard, telling Henry there is ""one more thing"" to do."
Flight Crew,"Alexey Gushchin is a talented young military pilot does not accept authority and acts in accordance with a personal code of honor. He is given a mission to deliver a cargo of supplies for charity, but the plane is also filled with cars for a general whose friend's daughter is getting married. During the mission, realising that the plane cannot go through the storm easily, he disposes of one of the cars in mid-air. For his actions, he is prevented from flying a military aircraft again and in spite of that, he asks his father Igor (famous aircraft engineer) for help getting back on the scene. He applies to a passenger airline, with Leonid Zinchenko overseeing his examination in a simulation. During the test, Alexey demonstrates impressive flying skills, but fails the test when he is unable to prevent the plane from crashing into a building on landing. Leonid, under pressure from his peers, retries the test and also crashes, forcing him to hire Alexey as the second pilot-trainee on the Tu-204SM along with attendant Andrey under the guidance of Zinchenko. Meanwhile, Zinchenko is experiencing family problems due to his absence from home and his alienation from his son Valera, who has abandoned education. Meanwhile, Alexey begins a relationship with pilot Alexandra Kuzmina.
On one of their flights, Gushchin and Zinchenko evacuate tourists from an African country in a revolution, but Gushchin becomes appalled when he learns that Zinchenko refused to allow the locals to board the plane. Zinchenko tells him that he must just stick to his orders.
While preparing for a flight, Gushchin confronts a wealthy man who refuses to obey safety regulations. Eventually, this leads to a fight on a plane, and Gushchin is fired. At the same time, he and Alexandra strain their relationship. The next day, on the train, Gushchin is confronted by Zinchenko who, impressed with Alexey's abilities, wants him back. Zinchenko also plans to take Valera on the next flight as well to convince him to continue his education.
The crew boards the plane for their next flight to Southeast Asia. During the flight, the crew receives a message about a volcanic eruption on one of the Aleutian Islands called Kanwoo and decides to go to the epicenter of the disaster to evacuate people before the expected volcano eruption. The crew arrives at the Kanwoo airport, where they discover that many people were killed or injured. They must now evacuate the remaining people who are coming on minibuses. Gushchin goes to the airport, when suddenly a powerful earthquake destroys the airport's infrastructure and destroys one of the runways, while the other one is covered with burning oil.
The crew then receives word that one of the minibuses has become trapped in a rockfall. Gushchin, Andrey and Valera go on two minibuses to retrieve the passengers. After the minibuses leave, Zinchenko, Alexandra and the rest of the passengers observe the eruption of the volcano. Realising that the runway will be soon overflowed with lava, Zinchenko and Alexandra abandon Tu-204 in favour of An-26, intending to leave Tu-204 for Alexey. Meanwhile, Gushchin, Andrey and Valera find the stranded passengers, but on their way back to the airport, the road is blocked by a lava flow. Andrey, who has driven his minivan into the lava, tells the passengers to get out of the back and climb into Gushchin's van. He manages to then save himself just in time before the van is swept off the cliff by the flow.
The trio and the passengers make it back to the airport on foot, only to find Tu-204 standing empty and Zinchenko and the rest of the passengers gone. The group climbs into the plane. Seeing that it is impossible to take off at the main runway due to its damage, Gushchin decides to use the shorter runway, which is covered in burning oil. After a water tower breaks and puts out the fire, Gushchin is able to take off successfully. Despite several engine fires from the ash cloud, the crew manages to escape the zone. The crew then comes into contact with Zinchenko's plane. Valera, knowing of his father's actions and seeing them as unjust, tells him over the radio, ""I will never forgive you"".
The only appropriate airport of them to land in Elisovo Airport, but a storm is now approaching the airport. Zinchenko reports to Alexei the fuel tank was damaged during take off, resulting in them rapidly losing fuel. This means that they would not be able to reach the coast. Igor, who has discovered his son's whereabouts, and is now at the air company's HQ, tells him over the radio his proposed plan: using the cage on An-26, they can transfer the passengers from that plane to Tu-204, which has much more fuel. Gushchin accepts the idea, and is backed by Valera, Andrey and the passengers.
The planes meet at an acceptable height, and the passengers of An-26 transfer a cable to Tu-204, allowing them to begin evacuating the passengers on An-26 via the cage. The first two operations are successful, with Alexandra being amongst the ones saved, but on the third go, the cage's ropes snap, sending 11 people falling to their deaths, forcing Zinchenko to evacuate An-26 on the cable before the plane plunges into the ocean. The crew then receives the news that conditions at Elisovo have worsened, but the crew still decides to land there due to their plane having one engine and a faulty chassis, disobeying their order. Gushchin admits to fearing landing the malfunctioning plane in bad weather and risking the lives of passangers, but Zinchenko reminds him of his skill. At landing, the landing chassis breaks and one of the engines flies off with its wing, but nevertheless, the entire crew survives. Zinchenko congratulates Gushchin with the landing, and leaves the plane, helped by Valera, who has forgiven his father. As emergency services begin to arrive, the survivors rejoice and mourn the loss of their loved ones. Victorious, Gushchin leaves the scene into the night while Alexandra looks on.
Sometime later, Gushchin and Alexandra have married and Zinchenko has fully reconciled with Valera. Despite this, they are fired from their jobs as pilots by the flight company's director for disobeying the order to not land at Elisovo. However, after the two leave, the director make a call to Aeroflot, asking them if they ""need any pilots in their company"". Gushchin and Zinchenko are transferred to Aeroflot as flight interns, while Alexandra becomes a pilot in the same company."

Although duels of honor are technically illegal in Russia at the time, most people turn a blind eye to the law. The code of practice is not written down anywhere, and yet everyone knows the rules and rituals, while many participants see it as an almost mystical rite.

He is a shadowy puppet master with a grudge and designs on Princess Martha Tuchkova whose brother (Prince Tuchkov) Yakovlev is scheduled to duel with next.

Attraction,"The storyline revolves around colonel Valentin Lebedev, who is in charge of the military operation, his daughter Yulia, who develops a romantic relationship with the alien Hekon, and her former boyfriend Artyom who is the main antagonist.
Hekon is a representative of a technologically-advanced humanoid race who arrives to Earth incognito for research purposes. His spaceship is damaged by a meteor shower. The Russian Air Force mistakes his spaceship for a NATO spy satellite/spacecraft and damages it by firing missiles into it, causing it to crash into several buildings in Moscow and kill hundreds of people. It is on that same day when Yulia and Artyom have finished attending a meteor-watching event, that Yulia's friend Svetlana is killed while watching some meteors.
The Russian government decides not to enter into a contact with the ship and let it fix itself on its own. The landing area is evacuated, fenced, and guarded, and Moscow is placed under a curfew. Meanwhile, Yulia, Artyom, and his friends Khariton, Ruslan, and Piton sneak into the crash site to investigate the alien: after they beat him up and cause him to crash down a building, they retrieve his armor before an army patrol may find them. On another day, Yulia sneaks again to retrieve the alien, placing him to a nerdy classmate known as ""Google"" to help the alien recover. While examining his body, she notices a wristband forming on her right wrist, which manipulates water.
The alien, who introduces himself as ""Hekon"", was initially unsure about Earth and its people, but tells them that he is looking for a device known as ""Shilk"", that allows him to travel through space without destroying his body. Shilk, like the spaceship, appears to be attracting water. As he goes out to the streets to look for the device, the police mistake him for a drug addict and send him off to a police station to be interrogated.
Meanwhile, Artyom and his friends drive in their car to inform Colonel Lebedev about the alien's armor that they had hidden in their garage. and stumble upon a crowd who is angry over rationed water, as the spaceship appears to absorb water in order to repair itself. Ruslan decides to provoke the crowd into becoming a disorderly riot. Artyom is hit by a policeman's baton as he tries to convince people to stop rioting, and is taken to the police station but he forgets to tell Colonel Lebedev about his discovery.
In order to get Shilk, Yulia goes to see her father, who interrupts his meeting with his officers when she informed him that she is pregnant with Hekon's child. She actually says this to distract him, so Hekon can disguise himself as a scientist and take Shilk from its container, and also because she was upset that he did not spend much time with her after her mother passed away.
Yulia confesses her true feelings for Hekon in a phone call to Artyom, while Artyom arrives with his friends to beat up the alien. Hekon fights back, and when one of Artyom's friends tries to shoot Hekon, Ruslan is shot by accident instead. Artyom and one of his friends flee before the police would arrest them. He reports this incident to gather many supporters and form a group to attack Hekon's spaceship, and avenge Ruslan's death, whom he blames the alien for causing it. In spite of his initial support, Piton sometimes expresses doubt on Artyom's goals.
Artyom's group breaks through a police barricade, triggering several other robotic suits to come out and fight against the mob. Yulia and Hekon drive through the police barricade and the mob using a military car to return him and Shilk back to their ship, while fending off against Artyom, who angrily rampages using Hekon's suit. Hekon defeats Artyom, but Artyom shoots him and Yulia with a dropped military rifle. Saddened by this, Colonel Lebedev follows several walking suits as they carry Yulia and Hekon to the spaceship, where its machinery uses water to nurse Yulia's injuries. The spaceship's computer also responds to Lebedev's questions about Hekon's mission to observe the Earth, as its warlike civilizations and history had made it very unsafe for interstellar contact. However, Yulia's love for Hekon, and her willingness to protect him, have caused the computer's authorities to rewrite the results of their study on Earth.
Yulia, her father, and everyone else return to their daily lives, as the spaceship departs and releases excess water. Meanwhile, Artyom is arrested and presumably sent to a prison camp.
The fabula of the movie is vocalized by Yulia at the end: The truth is that one alien from far away trusted us more than we trust ourselves."

While Grom talks to the guard, the ""Leader"" sits in the car and tells to the driver, another accomplice of the robbery nicknamed ""Vodila"", to leave the bank as soon as possible, but he starts to waste time. They drive off just when Grom leaves the bank, but they can not go far away - at the intersection the car is knocked down by a garbage truck. The Driver turns out to be badly wounded, and the ""Leader"" gets off only with a couple of scratches. He climbs out of the car and runs towards the hotel under construction. Major Grom catches up with the villain, and between them begins a fight, at the end of which the contused Grom loses. While Grom comes to, the criminal runs up the stairs to the top of the building. To shorten the path, Grom climbs onto the statue of Poseidon and jumps from it to the third floor. The pursuit continues and every time the hero overtakes the ""leader"", the late manages to escape. In the end, Grom waits for the robber behind one of the wooden walls and carries it while the ""Leader"" runs past.
The action is transferred to the news studio, where TV presenter Anna Terebkina tells about the rendered robbers, the capture of which is the merit of Major of the MVD, Igor Grom.
Before the beginning of the credits, a scene is shown showing the Plague Doctor, lighting a match and throwing it to the ground, after which a bright flame flares up."

Guardians,"During the Cold War, a secret organization known as ""Patriot"" gathers a team of Soviet superheroes, altering and augmenting the DNA of many selected individuals throughout the former state's territory, in order to defend the homeland from superhuman threats. The team includes representatives of the different nationalities of the Soviet Union and allegedly implies restoration of former USSR. Arseniy, codenamed Ursus (Anton Pampushny), can change into a huge, incredible strong bear-man. Temirkhan, codenamed Khan (Sanjar Madi), has super-speed and wields a pair of curved swords. Lernik, codenamed Ler (Sebastien Sisak), has the ability to control earth and stone. Finally, Xenia (Alina Lanina) has the power of invisibility and can transform her body into water.
The program succeeds where a second program called Module-1 fails. This prompts Professor August Kuratov (Stanislav Shirin), creator of Module-1, to flee to the remote wilderness, away from Soviet authorities, to continue working on his experiments. When the military is summoned to arrest him, he bombs the Patriot laboratory, surviving because he was covered with some chemicals. He rebuilds his damaged body making himself into a cyborg. This gives him the power to generate electricity and control machines. He also created an army of clones of himself, and sets out to prove to the world that he is a genius. After the explosion, Arsus, Ler, Khan, and Xenia go into hiding for years.
In the present day, several walking robots used in a training exercise turn against their supervising officials and kill them. This leads to the Ministry of Defence holding a meeting and deciding to revive the Patriot organization under the leadership of Major Elena Larina (Valeriya Shkirando) and to locate their missing super agents. She finds Ler spending his time meditating in the Khor Virap Monastery in Armenia; Khan living on the steppes of Kazakhstan; Ursus in a remote cabin on the Putorana Plateau in northern Siberia; and Xenia performing stunts in a circus in Moscow. Their first task is to raid Kuratov's laboratory within an old factory, but they are captured.
Kuratov offers the Guardians a chance to join him but they refuse. This angers him and he keeps three of them trapped within a magnetic force field and injures Ler. He later goes to a military facility at Noginsk to take control of the tanks and other vehicles stationed there. Using them, he launches an invasion of Moscow and makes preparations to use the Ostankino Tower and the Federation Tower for his Module-2 Projec. He intends to transmit a signal through an old Soviet satellite, which will then be sent to every other satellite orbiting Earth, and use it to seize control of all technology in the world. He uses a force field to protect his beacon-tower and destroy several jet fighters that are sent to stop him. When a collaborator within the Russian military, Major-General Nikolai Dolgov, asks Kuratov for a reward for his help, Kuratov strangles him to death.
While Ler recovers, he reflects on the fact that his superhuman abilities prevent him from aging normally. He has stayed the same age while his wife and grandchildren have grown older and passed away. At the meantime, Major Elena frees the other team members from Kuratov's laboratory. She sends Kuratov's former rival to study one of Kuratov's clones. Unfortunately the real Kuratov releases poison gas to kill him. Arsus and the other Guardians are trained in the Patriots' facility and are given suits and weapons.
The Guardians go to Moscow: Xenia and Ursus advance through the streets, Ler defeats several soldiers patrolling an underground car park, and Khan uses an airplane to try to fly above Kuratov's force field. The three Guardians enter a shopping mall, and cross an iron bar linking it to the tower-beacon, but are attacked by more of Kuratov's troops. Khan jumps from the airplane and slices the pipe, causing Kuratov's troops to fall.
While the other Guardians figure out a way to destroy the power source for Kuratov's beacon, Xenia touches the power source and injures herself, temporarily disabling the beacon's transmissions and causing the force field to collapse. The Guardians battle Kuratov on the platform, but fail to defeat and kill him. As the guardians leave on a grappling rope hanging from an airplane, Kuratov's beacon interferes with the plane's controls. Khan cuts the grappling rope linking them to the falling airplane and they land to a river.
As they swim to a road, they consider going back to Kuratov's beacon to destroy it and kill Kuratov, but Major Elena arrives and commands them not to. She tells them that as superhumans, they can also pool their energy and release it as a blast, but doing so can be fatal. The Guardians touch each other and generate a blast of energy that damages Kuratov's tower, causing Kuratov to fall to his death. Major Elena says that, while Kuratov boasted that he created the Guardians, they really created themselves.
The Guardians recover, rendezvousing with Major Elena on a bridge in the rebuilt Moscow. Although they choose to go back to their normal lives, they also consider continuing their service to the Patriot organization. In a post-credits scene, Elena is seen attacking a soldier after his truck stops. When she questions the soldier, he tells her that ""Ferrum"" has sent him as part of an unspecified mission."
After You're Gone,"Famous ballet dancer Alexey Temnikov (Sergey Bezrukov) dedicated his whole life to the stage, performing in various halls around the world. The press referred to him as ""genius of dance"" and compared him with Mikhail Baryshnikov.
But in the 1990s, Temnikov suffered a serious spinal injury, which interrupted his dancing career. Alexey returned to his native town in the suburbs with a population of 70 thousand people and opened his own dance school-studio and an apothecary business.
After 20 years, Alexey's life does not change, he still lives in his hometown, where he teaches dance. He has a girlfriend named Marina (Karina Andolenko), who is pregnant with his child. Also, Alexey finds out that he has a 12 year old daughter Chiara, who wants Alexey to teach her dance. But Alexey does not show any initiative in marriage or being a father.

The Age of Pioneers,"The film is set in the 1960s, during the Cold War and the Space Race between USSR and the United States. The Soviets plan to send a man into space. During the construction of the craft, a technician is killed and the engineers question the safety of the craft. A test vehicle, representing the Voskhod 2 spacecraft is destroyed two weeks before the official launch and Soviet engineers cannot identify the causes of the explosion and sudden loss of communication. Ex-WW2 pilot, Pavel Belyayev, and military test pilot Alexey Leonov are called to man the Voskhod 2 craft but during a skydive, Pavel injuries his leg landing and is not considered fit; instead, he is replaced by a new, young and immature cosmonaut (Yevgeny Khrunov), much to the dismay of Alex. Fuelled by anger and determination, Pavel trains himself to become stronger and eventually is re-admitted into the space program, much to the delight of Alexey.
The Voskhod 2 launches into space and Alexey is ordered to commence his spacewalk. The spacewalk is successful and the Soviets celebrate but Alexey's suit begins to inflate, rendering him inflexible and unable to enter the airlock. The ship loses communication with ground control when it enters a dead zone. Alexey defies instructions and enters the airlock head first but the outer hatch fails to fully close. He forces himself to turn within the airlock and manages to close the airlock right before his oxygen supply runs out and he passes out. Pavel drags him into the pod and succeeds in reviving him. The two are then instructed to orbit for 22 hours until Cycle 4, an automatic system that will land them. Pavel detaches the airlock, but it causes the Voskhod 2 to spin slightly. Before Cycle 4, Pavel and Alexey begin to feel queasy and find that the oxygen partial pressure is uncommonly high. Ground control states that the system mistakenly detected a leak and began pumping pure oxygen into the cabin. They are told to find and disconnect a yellow wire to disable the system.
Pavel passes out from oxygen toxicity, and Alexey takes control, reaching for the wire. The oxygen causes Alexey to hallucinate about his times as a young boy, running in a field, searching for the nest of a bird. He manages to twist the yellow wire but passes out before it is disconnected. During his hallucination, he remembers of reaching out to the bird who injured him, this moment in his hallucination causes him to flinch and disconnect the yellow wire. The system stops pumping oxygen into the cabin.
Both cosmonauts awake to find that Cycle 4 has failed to run and Soviet engineers and mathematicians on the ground fail to respond with an explanation, concluding that the spin of the craft may have caused the problem. The cosmonauts are permitted to use manual mode to re-direct the ship. After Pavel successfully stabilizes the craft, it re-enters the atmosphere and is detached from the instrument section. The craft lands by parachute into the Ural mountain range, far from the expected landing site. A search party is sent after the cosmonauts, but their radio signals are not picked up. A radio fan on Sakhalin accidentally picks up their radio signals and phones the Space Agency, notifying them of the cosmonauts' position. A nearby rescue helicopter is ordered to search for them but is unable to see them due to severe weather conditions. The helicopter is called back to base, but with the cosmonauts close to death, the crew spot Alexey's flare and come down to rescue them.
The two cosmonauts arrive by plane to the Agency to meet with their wives and children. Later they are paraded through Moscow where countless civilians cheer them."

Loveless,"In Moscow, at the end of the school day, students are departing on their way home. One twelve-year-old boy, Alyosha (Matvey Novikov), decides to take a path which leads him to walk by a local river in a wooded area just on the outskirts of town. He appears to be in no particular rush to get home. His parents, Zhenya (Maryana Spivak) and Boris (Aleksey Rozin), are in the midst of a divorce, with much animosity toward each other, and Alyosha is caught up in the middle of their bitter fights. His parents are portrayed as having divergent and incompatible personalities, and both have new relationships: Boris with Masha (Marina Vasileva), a young woman who's pregnant with his child; Zhenya with Anton (Andris Keiss), an older and wealthier man with an adult daughter who lives abroad.
One day, Zhenya realizes Alyosha has disappeared from home since the day before, when she came home late at night from a visit with Anton and assumed the boy was sleeping. The police see this as the simple case of a runaway child and expect the boy to return home within a day or two. When Alyosha does not return, a volunteer group specializing in the search for missing persons takes over the case and promptly initiates a thorough procedure to locate the boy. The only relative Alyosha could have sought refuge at is Zhenya's estranged mother, who lives several hours away. Boris and Zhenya's trip to see her not only fails to provide clues to Alyosha's whereabouts, but is punctuated by tension, with both spouses berated by the bitter old woman. On the return trip home, a new fight between Zhenya and Boris escalates to the point that Boris asks her out of the car and abandons her on a rural roadway.
Now the search for Alyosha involves the police again and covers an increasingly wider territory across the town and its surrounding areas. A search of an abandoned building from an old dilapidated city development project that a friend of Alyosha revealed as their usual hideout turns up nothing. Finally, Zhenya and Boris are asked to come to the morgue to identify the remains of a John Doe child whose description matches Alyosha's. Both parents deny that the disfigured child's body is their son's, though the experience proves emotionally traumatic for them as they break down in tears of desperation, with Alyosha still missing.
Some time passes, Boris and Zhenya's apartment has now been sold after their divorce was presumably finalized, and workers begin dismantling wall hangings and appliances in Alyosha's old room. Outside on the streets, missing person posters of Alyosha now canvas the entire neighborhood. More time goes on and now Boris lives with Masha and their infant son, whom he treats coldly. Zhenya in turn moved in with Anton. Both their lives went on, while Alyosha's missing person posters are fading away. The final scene goes back to the wooded path near the river through which Alyosha used to walk home after school; the naked winter tree branches sway slightly against the white sky, showing the strip of tape Alyosha had thrown on top of a tall tree, now the only remaining trace of his past presence in the world."
Gogol. The Beginning,"Year 1829. Young Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol serves as a judicial clerk in the Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery in St. Petersburg. During service, most often when murders occur, Gogol suffers seizures, throughout which he is pursued by strange visions, and in the unconscious state he writes seemingly meaningless words.
Suddenly, Gogol meets with the famous investigator Yakov Petrovich Guro, who immediately notes the unusual quality of the young clerk: his rambling records are valuable clues to the investigation and the murderer is revealed in the shortest possible time. In the evening of the same day, Gogol, overwhelmed by criticism and insecurity in his own talent, in tears and impotent rage burns all the purchased examples of his first work ""Ganz Kühelgarten"". The next morning Gogol is visited by Guro, who warmly supports him and advises him not to lose heart after his first failed attempt at writing, and also expresses his gratitude for the short cooperation. Guro is going to investigate the mysterious murders of girls in the Poltava province near the small village of Dikanka. Gogol, who had a vision of this at night, asks Guro to take him along as assistant and clerk, since he comes from those places. Guro, sympathetic and intrigued by seizures-visions of the young man, easily gives his consent and they set out on their journey.
Arriving in Dikanka, Gogol and Guro begin an investigation. The assassin is described as the Dark Horseman, and the superstitious population is extremely reluctant to help the investigation from St. Petersburg, especially in the person of local investigator Alexander Khristoforovich Binh. In the same place Gogol acquaints himself with the wife of landowner Danishevsky, Elisabeth, a fan of his creativity, towards whom he begins to feel (as he tries to convince himself) platonic emotions. He also gets acquainted with the landowner Danishevsky himself, a strange and mysterious man, living with his wife apart from Dikanka, despite a close neighborhood. During one of the visions of Gogol Oksana (as it turns out later, a mermaid) appears. In exchange for the help of Nikolai (to identify which of the mermaids is actually a witch draining strength from drowned women) she promises to help him in the investigation. To Guro's surprise and fury, it turns out that the same murders took place 30 years ago and nothing was done to uncover them.
During the next vision, Gogol manages to identify among the mermaids the witch who turns out to be Hannah from an inn. In the morning Gogol and Guro find a hand at an abandoned mill (mermaids when tearing the witch apart, ripped off her hand). Gogol and Guro assume that they found the Horseman and rush to the inn where they discover Hanna; she does not have the hand that was found at the mill. The enraged witch easily copes with Guro, then attacks Gogol, but Binh kills her. The case is solved, and he can return to St. Petersburg. But the night before the departure of Gogol in a dream is Oksana and tells him that the real killer is at large, and Hannah was only an accomplice. At this time, in a barn in the nearby shed, the Horseman fights with Yakov Petrovich Guro, the shed is collapsing, and everyone believes that Guro and the Dark Horseman died under his wreckage. However, the remains of the Rider are not found. Gogol decides to stay and finish the investigation himself.
At night, the Horseman comes to the grave of Hanna and resurrects her. The Witch begs the Horseman for forgiveness, speaking of Gogol's strange abilities, but the Horseman is deaf to her pleas. From the barn, where they hold Hanna's body, the witch's cry is heard.
A few days later in Dikanka there is a new murder: Baba Khavronya dies right on the date with the priest, her lover. He raves about a pig's head and a red scroll, the symbol of conjugal infidelity, which the devil throws to the threshold. The murder was arranged as if the Dark Horseman had done it, but during the seizure Gogol paints a leaf of a linden (""linden"" means a fake), and waking up quickly notices that the sign of the Horseman is drawn with an error. When a murder weapon is found in the house, the husband takes the blame on himself.
In Dikanka, Dr. Leopold Leopoldovich Bomgart comes to the aid of Gogol, a man of exclusively scientific mindset, who denies the existence of evil spirits. An autopsy shows that Baba Khavronya died not from a wound, but from a rupture of the heart because of the strongest fright. Her ghost begins to appear and threaten the stepdaughter Paraska, who will soon have a wedding. Gogol again is tormented by visions about Oksana and Elizabeth: according to the mermaid, in order to learn how to manage his gift, Nikolai must give up worldly attachments and, first of all, feelings from Liza.
Gogol finds the solution with the help of blacksmith Vakula and Dr. Bomgart: the candle bought by Paraska from the gypsies (which burned during the interview with Khavronya and the priest) is stuffed with ingredients that cause hallucinations - Gogol, breathes a bit of smoke from this candle and sees one of his greatest fears: Pushkin mocking him, whose criticism of his work he is very afraid. Realizing that the murderer is Paraska, who staged the devil's attack so that her stepmother would not stop her from getting married, Gogol exposes her, but she escapes into the forest. With the help of sorcery the ghost of Khavronya catches Paraska and gives her to the Horseman as a new sacrifice. Gogol, Yakim, Vakula and Dr. Bomgart try to catch up, and upon hearing her cry they want to help, but the way is blocked by the witchcraft of the ghost Khavronya. Only thanks to the candle, lit by Dr. Bomgart, the heroes manage to stop the witchcraft. But an unexpected event occurs: the ghost of Khavronya, once faced with Gogol, suddenly becomes terrified and howls ""No, do not come near me! Dark one... "" disappears, leaving Gogol and his friends in perplexity. But they do not have time to contemplate: Paraska is found dead in a boat by the river bank, and on the ground gleams the terrible symbol of the Dark Horseman.
The next morning at the inn, Gogol gathers Dr. Bomgart, the blacksmith Vakula and his servant Yakim, the only people whom he can trust in the whole of Dikanka; all three agree to help him in the fight against the terrible enemy. Unbeknownst to everyone in the old mirror appears smiling Oksana. It turns out that among the things of Yakov Petrovich Guro there was a trunk, which he ordered to give to Gogol in case of unforeseen circumstances. Vakula easily opens the lock of the chest, to which no one could find the key. When touching the lock Gogol gets a new vision: the next victim of the Dark Horseman can become Lisa. A smile disappears from Oksana's face, and she leaves.
The chapter and the first film ends with a scene, where Yakov Petrovich Guro, who seemingly died in a fire, observes the village of Dikanka while standing on a cliff."
Salyut-7,"USSR, June 1985. After contact with the Salyut 7 space station is lost, cosmonauts Vladimir Dzhanibekov and Viktor Savinykh dock with the empty, frozen craft, and bring her back to life.[4]"
The Last Warrior,"The film opens with sorceress Varvara, princess of the fantasy world Belogorye (""The White Mountain""), hunting down who she claims to be the last Bogatyr in the world. She petrifies him and throws him into the sea, where hundreds of other victims rest.
Ivan Naydenov is a young man living in modern Moscow, an orphan who managed to make his way in life by being a con artist: he masquerades as a ""white mage"", starring in rigged psychic contest shows and performing ""rites"" for clients. He starts having doubts about his selfish life choices, however, when asked to help a boy in a coma to wake up, which he obviously cannot do.
One day, during a faulty escape from a client's husband, he miraculously ends up in Belogorye. This parallel world is inhabited by the characters of Russian fairy tales and magic is commonplace. Leshy appears to have dragged Ivan there, claiming that Ivan is the lost son of Ilya Muromets himself, hidden on Earth years ago. Ivan is then immediately captured by Varvara's warriors and brought before prince Dobrynya Nikitich.
Dobrynya seems friendly at first, but Varvara soon throws Ivan into dungeon behind her husband's back. There, Ivan meets disembodied Koschei, who tells him that the only way to get back to Earth is by using the magical Sword Kladenets. He himself used it to achieve immortality, but Bogatyrs overthrew and imprisoned him thirty years prior. Since the forces of good have won, first most of the magical creatures were imprisoned or killed, and then Bogatyrs themselves. Provided Ivan is truly the son of Ilya, he can uncover the Sword and use it to bring the magical creatures back their power, and to return home.
Baba Yaga is soon captured and thrown into the same dungeon, but it proves to be a trick: she brought along Vasilisa the Wise in frog form, who easily releases the prisoners. Despite Ivan being more of nuisance than any help, the three decide to take him with themselves and find the Sword together. Escaping the dungeon, they also enlist Vodyanoy the Merman, attracted to Baba Yaga (in her younger form, obviously). Koschei tells Ivan that Vasilisa helps them because her entire village was turned into frogs by jealous Varvara after she caught the eye of Dobrynya. Despite bonding with Vasilisa over the loss of their parents, Ivan still decides that he wishes to get home and not to stay with her.
Varvara eventually captures the heroes, turns Vodyanoy into stone and forces Ivan to get the Sword for her, lest his friends are killed. Ivan does recover the Sword and overpowers his foes with it, but Koshei turns out to be in league with Varvara. Moreover, Dobrynya himself is revealed to be the mastermind of the whole scheme, planning to use the Sword to get the same kind of immortality as Koschei. Reasoning that he no longer needs his help, Dobrynia betrays Koschei, and Ivan uses the Sword to escape to Earth.
Back in Moscow, he quickly realizes that he cannot abandon his beloved Vasilisa in trouble, and decides to get back. Upon finding Leshy, he returns to Belogorye, sets free Zmey Gorynych and uses a modern handgun to fight his way to Dobrynya. However, the latter has already completed the ritual and is now immortal, about to execute Vasilisa and Baba Yaga. Using Gorynych as distraction and cover, Ivan challenges Dobrynya to a fair duel, hoping to give his companions time to destroy the magical stone and therefore undo the Immortals' invulnerability. During the fight, Dobrynya reveals that it was his envy of Ilya that led to betrayal of bogatyrs.
Koschei eventually gets his hands on the magical stone, and, touched by the selfless heroism of his companions, decides to shatter it, killing himself and Dobrynya. Varvara escapes Belogorye in horror, and her petrified victims come back to life, Ilya among them, reunited with his son now. Ivan decides to stay in Belogorye rather than return to the life of a fake ""mage"", marrying Vasilisa. The only thing he comes back into his world for is to use the real magic to help the comatose boy from the beginning of the film.
The film ends with Varvara on Earth, meeting her mother. It is revealed that the two planned to enthrall Dobrynya and gain dominion over Belogorye, but with that plan failed, will now have to make a different move."
Mathilda,"The film tells the story of the romantic relationship between the heir to the Russian throne, Nikolay Romanov, and the ballerina of the Imperial Theater, Matilda Kshesinskaya, from the time the 22-year-old crown prince and 18-year-old dancer met in 1890 to the coronation of Nikolay and his wife Aleksandra Fedorovna in 1896."

This military tale (The Tale of the Destruction of Riazan) survived in several sixteenth and the seventeenth century redactions and is thought to be a part of a miscellany that was composed and revised by the clergy of the Church of St. Nikholas of Zaraisk. According to the legend, the church is located on the spot where the princess Eupraxy killed herself. Given a form of a military tale, the later version of The Tale of Batu's Capture of Ryazan is a fictionalized account with some historical inaccuracies suggesting that the Tale was composed sometimes after the described events and was subsequently further edited. Tracing its provenance, textual analysis, and dating of various redactions have been conclusively resolved by Soviet scholars.
The Tale of the Destruction of Riazan is one of the most interesting and best written accounts of the invasion of Russia by the Mongols: ...Within twelve years after bringing the miraculous icon of St.Nicholas from Kherson, the godless Emperor Batu invaded the Russian land with a great multitude of his Tatar warriors and set up camp on the river Voronezh in the vicinity of the principality of Riazan. And he sent his infidel envoys to the city of Riazan, to Great Prince Yury Ingvarevich, demanding tithes from everyone - from the princes and from all ranks of people.And the Great Prince decided to send his son, Fedor Yurevich, to Batu with many gifts and supplications that he not invade the land of Riazan...
Prince Fedor came to the Emperor Batu... And Batu began to entertain the Riazan Princes, and after this entertainment asked that they send their sisters and daughters to be his concubines. And one envious Riazan courtier told Batu that the wife of Prince Fedor belonged to the Byzantine imperial family and that she had a most beautiful body. Emperor Batu, who was false and merciless, became excited, and told Prince Fedor: ""Prince, give me your wife so that I may enjoy her beauty."" And Prince Fedor said - ""It is not our Christian custom to bring to you, the godless emperor our wives so that your lust may be satisfied. If you conquer us then you will be the ruler of our wives.""
The godless Batu felt offended, and became angry. He ordered the immediate death of Prince Fedor, and commanded that his body be thrown in a field where it would be devoured by beasts and birds. And the retinue and the warriors of Prince Fedor were also put to death.
One of the servants of Prince Fedor, by name Aponitsa, managed to escape, and wept bitterly, seeing the body of his master. Having noticed that no one guarded the corpse, he took his beloved master's body and buried it secretly. Then he hurried to Princess Eupraxy and told her that Emperor Batu had killed her husband. At that moment the princess happened to be on the upper floor of the palace with her infant son, Prince Ivan. When she heard from Aponitsa that her husband had been slain, she was seized with grief, and threw herself from the window with the child in her arms. And so both were killed...[5]
Evpaty and his soldiers return to Riazan, only to find that the Mongols had burned the city and massacred many of its inhabitants, including the defending soldiers, his wife Nastya and their children. He and his men raise the town bell and ring it, summoning the survivors. They hide as a band of Mongols return, and Evpaty kills them all with his two swords. Evpaty leads his men against a blizzard into a forest, and stumble upon a bear and a hermit. The hermit, Nestor, invites them into a cave where they rest for the night and receive herbs.
Evpaty and his soldiers use trickery to frighten and distract the Mongols and allow one of his soldiers to help Lada take several children to safety. He sends three soldiers on horseback to three princes in their cities, but only one accepted their request for help in fighting Batu Khan. He also ensures that the surviving people of his city hide in Nestor's cave. At the same time, his soldiers and Lada struggle to help him remember his current situation to stop him from attacking them.
Evpaty and his soldiers fight Batu Khan's soldiers on a hill, but the Mongols prevail, leaving Evpaty as the last member of his army. The Mongol officer asks Evpaty on his demands. Evpaty goes down from the hill, he shows them a seal that Batu Khan had given to him earlier, causing the Mongols to avoid killing him. Evpaty taunts Batu Khan that now the latter is the one who kneels, and dies from his wounds from being hit by stones thrown by trebuchets.
Because he led his warriors to keep fighting the Mongols to the end, Batu Khan orders his soldiers to build a mound to bury Evpaty's body, one that became taller than the hill where he fought the Mongols. Many years later, another Russian prince leads a larger army to face an invasion of Teutonic Knights."

The Wailing,"A Japanese man has recently arrived at a little village in the mountains of South Korea, living in a secluded house. A mysterious disease starts spreading among the villagers, causing a rash which precedes violent murderous outbreaks followed by stupor and eventually death.
Police officer Jong-goo, who is investigating the case, meets a mysterious young woman called Moo-myeong (“no name” in Korean), who tells him about the Japanese stranger, and later disappears. A local hunter tells Jong-goo that he saw the near-naked stranger eating a deer, with glowing red eyes. Jong-goo is unsettled, as he has had dreams about this stranger, which the hunter had described to him. He enlists the help of another police officer, and a Japanese-speaking deacon to serve as translator, and they investigate the stranger's house while he is away. The other police officer finds pictures of the infected and murdered residents and their belongings. He is too shocked to say anything to the others. The stranger's house guard dog attacks the deacon and Jong-goo. The stranger arrives and pacifies the dog, and the other three leave.
The police officer tells Jong-goo of what he saw, and hands over a shoe which belongs to Jong-goo's daughter, Hyo-jin. Soon, Hyo-jin becomes sick and displays similar symptoms as the other infected villagers. Jong-goo makes his way to the stranger’s house with the deacon in anger, but finds that the pictures and evidence have been burned. Infuriated, he destroys the stranger's worship room and kills the dog when it attacks him, ordering the stranger to leave the village.
Distraught about Hyo-jin's condition, Jong-goo's mother-in-law seeks help from a shaman, Il-gwang. As Il-gwang performs a ritual to exorcise the demon, the stranger performs a ritual in his house simultaneously. Jong-goo finds his daughter in pain and interrupts the ritual, taking her to a hospital instead. The following day, he gathers his friends to hunt down the stranger, believing that the stranger is responsible for the disease and murders. Jong-goo and his friends go after the stranger, and are attacked by another infected villager. After a chase they eventually end up hitting the stranger with their vehicle. They dispose of his body as Moo-myeong watches from the hills. When Jong-goo returns home, he finds that Hyo-jin's condition has seemingly improved. Il-gwang suspects they killed the wrong person; he later encounters Moo-myeong, and starts vomiting blood. He calls Jong-goo, telling him that Moo-myeong is the real demon.
Jong-goo finds Moo-myeong near his house. She requests Jong-goo to believe her, telling him she had set a trap for the demon, but the trap will not work if Jong-goo goes back to his house. Il-gwang calls Jong-goo and tells him not to believe Moo-myeong, while she in turn tells him Il-gwang is actually in league with the real demon. Confused and hesitant, Jong-goo eventually leaves to save his family, but Moo-myeong grabs him, her skin turning a ghostly white as he notices that she is wearing the personal items of some of the victims. He pulls himself away, and as he crosses his home's threshold, the floral trap withers.
The deacon encounters the still-alive Japanese stranger in a cave. After being photographed by the stranger, the deacon witnesses the stranger evolving into a demon. Back at his house, Jong-goo arrives to find that Hyo-jin has murdered their family. He calls out to her, but she stabs him and falls into a stupor. Il-gwang arrives at Jong-goo's house and takes photographs of the family. While returning to his car, he unintentionally drops a box filled with photos of the other victims.
As Jong-goo lies dying in his home, he sees visions of happier times with his daughter and assures her he will protect her."
The Handmaiden,"In Japanese-occupied Korea, a conman operating under the sobriquet of ""Count Fujiwara"" plans to seduce a Japanese heiress named Lady Hideko, then marry her and commit her to an asylum in order to steal her inheritance. He hires a pickpocket named Sook-hee from a family of con artists to become Hideko's maid and encourage Hideko to marry him.
Hideko lives with her authoritarian Uncle Kouzuki. Kouzuki makes money by selling rare books, and he has Hideko give readings of the books for potential buyers. Sook-hee and Hideko grow closer, and Hideko allows Sook-hee to wear her dresses and jewelry. When Hideko asks Sook-hee what married life will be like, Sook-hee makes passionate love to her, promising her the same pleasures with her new husband. Sook-hee begins expressing reluctance about the plan, but when Hideko herself feels that she cannot go through with the marriage, Sook-hee insists she do so, causing Hideko to slap her and run away in frustration.
When Kouzuki leaves on business for a week, Hideko and Fujiwara elope. After cashing out Hideko's inheritance, it is then revealed that Hideko and Fujiwara double crossed Sook-hee and has convinced the asylum that she is the ""Countess,"" and have her committed in Hideko's stead.
A series of flashbacks show that Kouzuki was abusive to both Hideko and her aunt. The books he sells are sadistic pornography, which he trains and forces his wife to read at private auctions for the books, a practice that he also teaches Hideko during childhood. Hideko's aunt is eventually found hanged from a tree in the yard. When Hideko suspects the death was not suicide, Kouzuki takes Hideko into his basement, where he tells her that he murdered her aunt after she had attempted to run away.
In the more recent past, Hideko has grown up, and Fujiwara plans to seduce her to steal her inheritance. He finds this impossible due to Hideko being desensitized to sex acts and can not be seduced, and he instead makes a deal with her: if they get married, he'll save her from her uncle in exchange for half her inheritance. Hideko agrees under the condition that when they marry, he gives her a vial of poison guaranteed to kill her quickly in the event she is caught by her uncle and taken back to the basement. Hideko further proposes to hire a maid and commit the maid to an asylum in her place.
All the while being instructed by Fujiwara, who takes advantage of Sook-hee's illiteracy, Hideko unexpectedly falls in love with her. Knowing that the woman she loved was planning on betraying her, even with her feelings and their love making, Hideko tries to hang herself. Sook-hee saves her, and confesses her culpability in trying to commit Hideko and steal her inheritance. Hideko admits her plan to commit Sook-hee in her place, and the two vow to get revenge on both Kouzuki and Fujiwara. Hideko shows Sook-hee her uncle's collection of pornography, and Sook-hee destroys the collection in anger. Hideko eventually joins her, calling Sook-hee ""her savior"" from her uncle's abuse.
Sook-hee's friend Bok-soon sets a fire at the asylum and poses as a firefighter to help rescue Sook-hee. Meanwhile, Hideko poisons Fujiwara's wine, causing him to pass out while she takes the money and leaves. Sook-hee and Hideko reunite and flee together, disguising Hideko as a man to avoid detection.
Kouzuki captures Fujiwara upon receiving a letter from Hideko detailing Fujiwara's deception. He tortures Fujiwara in his cellar with his collection of antique bookmaking tools and presses him for sexual details about his niece. Fujiwara makes up a story about their wedding night, but a flashback shows that Hideko had cut her hand on a knife to stain her sheets, refusing to consummate the marriage. When Kouzuki presses for more details, Fujiwara convinces Kouzuki to give him one of his cigarettes. After smoking for a while, a disgusted Fujiwara refuses to give any further details. Kouzuki notices the cigarettes are producing blue smoke. Fujiwara reveals that his cigarettes had been laced with mercury, and the toxic gas within the smoke kills them both.
On a ferry to Shanghai, China, Sook-hee and Hideko celebrate their newfound freedom by making love once again."
The Truth Beneath,"Kim Yeon-hong (Son Ye-jin)appears to have a perfect life. She is beautiful, is married to a charismatic young politician (Kim Joo-hyuk), and her adolescent daughter who used to be a troublesome child is now doing better at school. Her husband, Kim Jong-chan decides to run for office against the powerful incumbent, No Jae-soon (Kim Eui-sung). A few days before the elections, Yeon-hong and Jong-chan's daughter, Kim Min-jin (Shin Ji-hoon) goes missing. At first, they assume she has run off to seek their attention as she had done before. However, Yeon-hong soon finds out that the friend Min-jin said she was going to meet does not exist. However, Yeon-hong learns from the school her daughter attends that she had an eccentric friend named Choi Mi-ok (Kim So-hee) and they were both bullied by their classmates.
While questioning Mi-ok, Yeon-hong notices the girl is wearing an expensive watch that looks like her daughter's despite coming from a poor family. Yeon-hong becomes suspicious and tells this to Jong-chan. However, her husband is more preoccupied with his campaign. Yeon-hong then hacks into her daughter's email account and finds leaked examination papers sent by a young female teacher at her school. Yeon-hong knows the teacher since she once invited Jong-chan to the school as a guest speaker. The teacher eventually admits she leaked the papers but only to help Min-jin and Mi-ok improve their grades so that they can become popular to avoid getting bullied.
As the police detectives fail to find any leaks, a desperate Yeon-hong goes to a shaman to find her daughter. However, it is all too late when the police finds Min-jin's dead body in the woods. A traumatized Yeon-hong blames her husband for their daughter's murder to get the city's sympathy vote since he refuses to tell the detectives where he and his driver were during the night Min-jin went missing. Despite his daughter's murder, Jong-chan is convinced by his party's president to continue his campaign.
Yeon-hong continues with her own investigation and finds an abandoned building where Min-jin and Mi-ok would practice their music. Yeon-hong convinces the police to hypnotize her but it is not helpful. They then run a lie detector test on her which reveals she is lying when she denies burying Min-jin's body but passes when she confesses that she did not kill her best friend. It is then revealed that Mi-ok is actually the daughter of Jong-chan's driver. Yeon-hong theorizes that Mi-ok was jealous of Min-jin for being rich and killed her out of jealousy. However, she has no evidence to prove it. Yeon-hong then breaks into Min-jin and Mi-ok's secret hideout and finds money hidden away in a bag. When Mi-ok shows up, Yeon-hong captures her and forces her to tell the truth about Min-jin's murder.
Mi-ok finally reveals that she and Min-jin became best friends after discovering they both shared the same taste in music. Min-jin then starts to suspect their teacher is having an affair. They then give the teacher a car air freshener with a hidden camera inside, which records the teacher having wild sex in her car with her secret lover. Min-jin and Mi-ok then uses the recordings to blackmail their teacher for exam papers. Since Mi-ok's family is poor, Min-jin then blackmails the teacher for money. One night, the two girls are out playing in the rain when a car runs over Min-jun while Mi-ok is hiding in the bushes. While the driver exits the car to take a photo of Min-jun's dead body, Mi-ok sneaks into the car and runs over the killer as well. She then carries Min-jin's body away and buries it in the woods after taking the contract killer's phone with her. Mi-ok is sure her teacher arranged for her and Min-jun to be killed. Yeon-hong takes the phone and is shown hatching a plan to kill the person who sent the contract killer to murder her daughter.
Later that day over dinner, Yeon-hong tells her husband that although No Jae-son most likely had nothing to do with their daughter's death, he must use the sympathy vote to win the election. Later that night, while her husband is celebrating his victory, Yeon-hong calls up the person who hired the contract killer and forces them to come to the scene of the crime or else she will leak the sex video onto the net. The person then shows up and it is not the teacher, but Jong-chan. Through flashbacks, we see that the man the teacher was having an affair with is none other than Jong-chan. After Min-jin blackmailed her teacher, the teacher told Jong-chan she is being blackmailed by two of her own students but does not tell him it is his own daughter and her best friend. Jong-chan unwittingly hired the contract killer to murder his own daughter. Yeon-hong ties her husband up and beats him in anger. She then uploads his sex video onto the internet as he watches helplessly."
Train to Busan,"Seok-woo, a divorced fund manager, is a workaholic and absentee father to his young daughter, Su-an. For her birthday the next day, she wishes for her father to take her to Busan to see her mother. They board the KTX at Seoul Station. Others on the same train are tough working-class husband Sang-hwa and his pregnant wife Seong-kyeong, a high school baseball team, rich-yet-egotistical COO Yon-suk, elderly sisters In-gil and Jon-gil, and a homeless man who is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.
As the train departs, a convulsing young woman boards the train with a bite wound on her leg. The woman soon becomes a zombie and attacks a train attendant, who then also turns into a zombie. The infection quickly spreads throughout the train. Baseball player Yong-guk, a girl named Jin-hee who has a crush on him, and several passengers manage to escape to another car. News broadcasts report zombie outbreaks throughout the country. The train stops at Daejeon, but the surviving passengers find that the city has also been overrun, and they hastily retreat back to the train, splitting up into different train cars in the chaos. The conductor restarts the train to head to Busan, where a successful quarantine zone has reportedly been established.
Seok-woo, Sang-hwa, and Yong-guk fight their way to where Su-an, In-gil, and Seong-kyeong are hiding, and together they struggle through the zombie horde to the front train car, where the other passengers are sheltered. However, at the instigation of Yon-suk, the passengers block the survivors from entering, fearing that they are infected. Sang-hwa and In-gil sacrifice themselves to give the others time to force open the door and enter the car. Yon-suk demands that the newcomers isolate themselves in the vestibule, and the others follow his lead. When Jong-gil deliberately opens the door to the zombies to be with her zombified sister In-gil, the zombies kill the rest of the passengers, leaving Seok-woo, Su-an and Seong-kyeong safe, as they are in the vestibule. Yon-suk and the train attendant escape the onslaught by hiding in the bathroom.
A blocked track at East Daegu train station forces the survivors to stop and search for another train. In the process, Seok-woo, Seong-kyeong, Su-an, and the homeless man are separated from Yong-guk and Jin-hee. Yon-suk escapes after pushing the train attendant to be killed by the zombies, then does the same with Jin-hee. Heartbroken, Yong-guk stays with Jin-hee and is soon bitten by her. The train conductor starts a locomotive on another track but is also killed by zombies while trying to save Yon-suk. The homeless man sacrifices himself to let Su-an and Seong-kyeong escape with Seok-woo into the train the conductor had activated. They encounter Yon-suk in the engine room, on the verge of turning into a zombie, having been bitten when the train conductor saved him. Seok-woo fights him off, but is himself bitten. He puts Su-an and Seong-kyeong inside the engine room and shares his last words with his daughter before moving outside. As he zombifies, he thinks of the first time he held his daughter in his arms and throws himself off the locomotive with a smile.
Su-an and Seong-kyeong get off at Busan and begin walking through a train tunnel. On the other side of the tunnel are soldiers stationed to defend the perimeter against zombies. Unable to see the new arrivals clearly, the soldiers at the checkpoint are instructed to shoot them. However, the soldiers then hear singing, which makes them realize the newcomers are human: it is Su-an, tearfully singing the song that she had wanted to perform for her father at the beginning of the film, now singing it to honor his sacrifice."

Luck Key,"Jae-sung, an aspiring actor who has hit rock bottom, prepares to commit a suicide. After his landlady insults him, he first cleans himself first at a public sauna. Hyung-wook, a notorious assassin, cleans himself at the same sauna after killing a target. Hyung-wook slips on a soap Jae-sung accidentally drops and passes out. Remembering Hyung-wook's luxurious look, Jae-sung switches his locker key with Hyung-wook's and steals his car and money. Feeling guilty, Jae-sung later tries to return everything to Hyung-wook, who is recuperating in the emergency room. When Jae-sung finds that Hyung-wook does not remember anything due to a concussion, he leaves without telling Hyung-wook anything.
While Jae-sung enjoys Hyung-wook's money and fancy apartment, Hyung-wook struggles to remember his identity, assuming he is Jae-sung because of the locker key. Hyung-wook can not pay his hospital bill, so Lina, a paramedic, pays it for him after he promises to pay her back. When Hyung-wook realizes he is bankrupt, Lina finds him a job at her mom's small restaurant. With his amazing knife skills, Hyung-wook becomes the main chef, drawing many customers for the restaurant. He later finds a marked date on a calendar with a location and learns that he (Jae-sung in reality) is an actor who is supposed to appear in a gangster-themed TV show as an extra.
Though he initially struggles as an actor, Hyung-wook excels in action scenes thanks to his real life skills. His role in the show becomes more significant with Lina's help as the show progresses. Hyung-wook and Lina also find themselves liking each other. Meantime in Hyung-wook's apartment, Jae-sung discovers a secret room and thinks that Hyung-wook is an undercover cop protecting a witness named Eun-joo, who lives in the same building. Jae-sung watches over her and, over time, falls in love with her.
One day, Jae-sung answers a phone call to Hyung-wook and meets with businessmen who ask him why Eun-joo is still alive. Jae-sung realizes that Hyung-wook is actually an assassin hired to kill Eun-joo. After a picnic with Lina's family, Hyung-wook recovers his memory and finds Jae-sung and Eun-joo in his own apartment. Hyung-wook reveals to Jae-sung that he is not a real assassin and that he has been trying to give a new life to assassination victims by faking their death and sharing the money he makes. Hyung-wook, Jae-sung, and Eun-joo devise a new plan for themselves so that they can start a new clean life.
Hyung-wook tells Lina that they cannot be together and leaves. Heartbroken, Lina follows him to a place where Hyung-wook, Jae-sung, and Eun-joo are trying to fake their own deaths in front of the people who hired Hyung-wook. Lina's unexpected interference almost ruins the plan. The businessmen believe that they are all dead and leave. Later, Hyung-wook tells Lina who he really is and apologizes. Lina, not sure what to do, takes him to the set of the TV show to finish the final scene. On the set, Hyung-wook improvises new lines and confesses his feelings to Lina, who accepts him. Jae-sung and Hyung-wook later star together in a new TV show.[6]"

Missing,"Ji-sun is a workaholic divorced woman working at a PR Company. Her job doesn't leave her with a lot of time to spend with her 1 year old daughter, Da-eun. Once, when her former nanny, a Chinese woman, had hit and injured Da-eun, Ji-sun had fired her but not being accustomed to taking care of her little girl, she had desperately been in need of a new nanny. Enter, Han-Mae, a young Chinese woman claiming to have a lot of experience with kids. Due to her poor conversational skills, Ji-sun had been hesitant in employing her, but when she managed to calm a crying Da-eun down within seconds, Ji-sun changed her mind and employed her immediately. She had also been entangled in a custody battle with her ex-husband, Jang Jin-hyuk, for her daughter. While her husband, a physician by profession, himself isn't too keen to have his daughter, her mother-in-law doesn't want to give up her granddaughter.
One day she received a call from her lawyer asking why she had not reached the court yet. Turns out Han-Mae had received the notice but had not mentioned it to Ji-sun, not knowing the importance of the document. She goes looking for Han-Mae to confront her about the mail, but neither she nor Da-eun are in the house. Ji-sun recalls that she had mentioned going to the clinic for Da-eun's vaccination. In the court, the judge reaches the conclusion that due to her workaholic nature and mental instability due to work and her divorce, Ji-sun had been told to hand over the girl to her in-laws months ago, but she did not abide by it. Her lawyer advises her to beg to her husband to let her keep the girl since there was no other way for her to achieve that.
On reaching home, Ji-sun finds it weird that none of the chores are done and on searching the house, Han-Mae and Da-eun are still not home. She goes around the neighbourhood, calling their names and starts becoming worried when she doesn't get any answer back. Her calls to Han-Mae also go unanswered. The security guard calls Han-Mae's protectiveness towards Da-eun peculiar. She even goes all the way to China-town to look for Han-mae, but that's a dead-end. Growing tired from all the worrying, Ji-sun falls asleep only to be woken up the next morning by her mother-in-law banging on the door. She has come to take Da-eun away. Ji-sun avoids her and heads for her car, determined to find Da-eun. She goes to the clinic that Han-Mae said she would take Da-eun to, only to find out that they had last come in 2 days ago and she had filled a prescription for a month's worth of flu medicines for the baby, something that mothers do when going on a long trip with their babies. To top it off, her neighbour's nanny, who had introduced Han-Mae to her as her niece, calls her back after getting a frantic voice-message from her. To Ji-sun's horror, she tells her that Han-Mae was not her niece and that she had paid her to introduce her in such a way. She reaches the police-station, now growing suspicious of Han-Mae. Her lawyer calls her after getting a call from her husband's lawyer, suspecting that she is trying to hide Da-Eun so her mother-in-law won't be able to take her away. He warns her of the price she would have to pay if does anything like that. Scared, she runs away from the police station not even realising that Han-Mae had forged her Foreigner Identification documents and the actual Piao Han-Mae was someone else.
She reaches home where she sees a man lurking around her flat. She grows suspicious of him when she recalls seeing him in front of her flat a few days ago as well. On confronting him, he reveals that Han-Mae owes him some money and he came here in order to get it back. She tells him that Han-Mae and her daughter have gone missing and he takes her to a Prostitution Bar in China-town, where Han-Mae used to work before. He takes her to a room where all the girls are waiting and in her paranoia, she mistakes another girl for Han-Mae and walks in on her and a customer in a room. The owner sympathises with her once she hears that her daughter is missing and promises to call her if she ever comes across or hears news of Han-Mae.
Just as she leaves the bar, she gets a call from a man claiming to have her daughter hostage. The man warns her not to calls the police and scares her even more when she hears Da-eun and Han-Mae's voices crying for help. Scared, she transfers all the money she has in her account to the kidnapper and is then instructed to go to the Yeouido Wharf. She runs around shouting Da-eun's name when she reaches the wharf, only to be greeted by a bag of her toys by the river, one of which she had bought for her very recently. The police arrive there shortly, Ji-sun having called them on the way.
She finally goes to the police station to lodge a missing person's report and the officer, Detective Park, finds it suspicious that she is lodging the report so late, having last seen the duo 2 days ago. She also realises that the call earlier had just been a Voice phishing call. Since Han-Mae can't be contacted at the moment, the police ask her to provide their photos. But, while there are plenty of Da-eun's photos, surprisingly, there is not even a single photo of Han-Mae in her phone while she distinctly remembers the 3 of them clicking a photo together on Da-eun's 1st birthday. In the midst of this, her mother-in-law bursts into the police station and demands to know where Ji-sun is hiding her daughter. She claims that Ji-sun and Han-Mae are working together in order to hide Da-eun. This is news to Detective Park who then proceeds to call her lawyer. He finds it suspicious as well that her daughter disappeared just days after she was served a detention. He tells her how big the problem is considering she doesn't even know Han-Mae's personal details and that her Foreigner ID was fake and even her phone was a burner phone.
She slips out of the police station and goes straight to her building, analysing the CCTV tapes from Thursday. She sees that they left on Thursday morning and were not seen since then. While she is reviewing the tapes, the security guard brings a high-schooler with him. The boy tells her that he had seen Han-Mae once, back when the other Chinese nanny was working for Ji-sun. The woman had brought Da-eun out shopping for fruits and were on their way back when a woman on a bicycle kept circling them. She had jerked the bag of fruits out of the nanny's hand, who then ran after it to collect the fallen produce. While the nanny was distracted, the woman had unbuckled Da-eun's safety belt and pushed the stroller downhill, causing it to crash and resulting in Da-Eun getting seriously injured. The high-schooler had revealed himself then and the woman had given him her bicycle and instructed him to keep quiet. It is now that we see that the woman was indeed Han-mae.
Distressed by this new information, Ji-sun hurriedly drives out her building premises just as the detectives come in to see her. With the resolution that she will find Da-eun on her own, she goes back to the bar. While she is waiting on the couch for the girl she had seen the other day, the owner tells Ji-sun how similar her and Han-Mae's habits are, referring to their shared habit of scratching the couch in their nervousness. In a flashback, we see Han-Mae when she had first come to the bar, looking for a job. In her broken Hangul, she had promised to work hard because she needed money. She had given her the name 목련 (Mok-ryeon - Magnolia). Just then a customer had walked in, who turned out to be Park Hyeon-ik, the man who had brought her there before. He had fallen in love with Han-Mae at first sight and had grown closer since he knew how to speak Mandarin. During one of their sessions, she had asked him about local anesthesia and had told him that she wanted to give her liver to someone. Mysteriously, she went somewhere everyday at 2pm and stayed out for 2–3 hours at a time. She never told anyone where she went. Amongst the things she left behind at the bar, Ji-Sun is surprised to find a photo of a baby. At the back of the photo, she finds the name of the studio and the date on which the photo was taken.
While Ji-Sun goes in search of 'Mihwa Studio', she ignores calls from the detectives and her husband. At the police station, CCTV footage shows her entering the lift with Park Hyeon-ik, who seems to be well known amongst the detectives. While they decide to look up Park Hyeon-ik, Ji-sun reaches the location of Mihwa Studio, which has now been renamed to 'Baby Love Studio'. Reaching the gates, she suddenly hears Da-eun calling out to her. Following the voice she sets out into the dark town. She seems to be in a nightmare as she sees Han-Mae and Da-eun and remembers her husband and mother-in-law admonishing her and she sees Han-Mae, with her back towards Ji-sun, holding a bloody Da-Eun. As she turns around, Ji-sun's face is seen covered in blood and she wakes up from her nightmare with a start, having fallen asleep in her car.
She wakes up just in time to see the owner opening shop for the day. He tells her that the photo was taken before the remodeling of the shop. He finds the negatives of the photo she brought and Han-Mae was indeed the mother of the child, so protective that she didn't even let the owner hold her daughter. He had registered the father's name as Han Suk-ho and the mother's name as Kim Yeon. The detectives come to the bar, having come across the same information. They find Han-Mae suspicious, having come to Korean after marriage, had a baby, then disguised herself as a nanny with a fake name and disappeared with the baby. They also suspect that she and Park Hyeon-ik conspired together. Meanwhile, Ji-sun pays a visit to Han-Mae's last known address in Chungcheon, having gotten it from the studio owner. She pays a visit to the now empty house but is soon interrupted by a neighbour who empathised with Han-Mae as his wife was a foreigner as well. They remember coming to their house so that the 2 women could learn Hangul together, but her mother-in-law and husband had strongly refused that. She is abused by both of them, both physically and emotionally, for not speaking the same language and for not being able to provide a child. They punish her by cutting off her long hair which draws sympathy from the neighbour's wife. He further tells her how things improved a bit when she finally conceived and she became much happier.
But things went back to being worse when one day her daughter, Jae-In, got sick. Having told to go to a hospital to avoid complications, her in-laws take the child away from her and leave in their car not wanting to spend much on a girl, leaving Han-Mae stranded in front of the clinic. She had run after the car, pleading and crying, but to no avail and that was the last time the neighbour saw her, having run away with her daughter a few days later. She had then once contacted the wife to tell her that her daughter got better after treatment in Seoul and she shows her a picture of the healthy baby. That is when the police chase her and take her to the police station. Han-Mae's mother-in-law is there to report her son missing since the last 2 days, but Ji-sun can't connect the names. She looks at the photo of the baby and realises the hospital she got treated at must be the Gangnam Catholic Hospital (the same hospital her husband works at), having seen an ID tag from the hospital amongst her belongings in the bar. The detectives release 'Missing' posters of Jae-in and it is revealed that Jae-in suffered from Congenital Biliary Atresia and she needed a liver transplant. She was not a suitable match and the father never got tested. They connect the dots and figure out that that must be why she abducted Da-eun, the process being easier with Hyeon-ik being an infamous Organ Trafficker. An elderly nurse at the hospital seems to recognise the kid, but keeps it to herself when no one seems interested in hearing her out.
The detectives head to an accident site where a man fitting Han Suk-ho's description is burnt inside the car. Ji-Sun is relieved to hear that no kid's body was found but is a little disturbed to hear that the accident must have taken back a week ago. A flashback from a week ago shows us that Han-Mae had returned home late in the night and Ji-sun, worried for her, had walked in on her undressing - her face was a nervous sweaty mess and her back had scars from abuse. In the present, Ji-sun enters the hospital with the detectives when she hears the same lullaby that Han-Mae used to sing. Following the sound, it turns out to be the elderly nurse from before. She tells them that Han-Mae was famous in the hospital as 'The Singing Chinese Woman'. People were subconsciously attracted to her when she sang to her daughter, some nurses stopping to listen to her. She had come across some financial problems with her daughter's hospital bills and had asked Hyeon-ik for help. He had convinced her to sell her organs in exchange for money, but help didn't come fast enough and her daughter was forcibly discharged. She hit her surgery site and started bleeding and in an attempt to get up, she accidentally snatched Ji-sun's husband's ID card. Looking back at the bed her daughter had just occupied, Han-Mae looks at the new occupant with hatred, the new occupant being Da-eun.
The nature of the case is changed to a Case of Kidnapping and Ji-sun goes home to a crowd of investigators, now investigating from a new angle. In a flashback, Da-eun was taken to the hospital for acute Pneumonia and her father was furious at her not being given a bed and for being kept in the ER for hours. Being an employee, he had pulled some strings and forcibly discharged Han Jae-in and this realisation strikes Ji-sun as she feels that that is where it all began. As she moves to the table, she sees a patchwork quilt that Han-Mae had made herself and embroidered the name 'Jae-in' at the back. She recalls back to how she had once fed her frozen kimchi. This prompts her to search the kimchi fridge. As she throws down all the boxes in the fridge, she comes across a cooler at the bottom. She opens the box and inside is a body of a child wearing the same clothes that Da-eun was wearing on her 1st birthday. She collapses in shock while her mother-in-law insists that the child is not Da-eun.
We flashback to after Han-Mae had discharged Jae-in and taken her home with her. Yellow with disease and burning with fever, Jae-in became very sick. Han-Mae ran out with Jae-in in her arms, but stopped on the way when she realised that Jae-in had already passed away. She broke down in the middle of the street, loudly mourning her loss. In the present, Ji-sun slips out of the house now filled with detectives and goes to sit on the swing in the playground. She remembers one day when she had come home to see Han-Mae sitting on the same swing with Da-Eun in her arms and how she had been so fond of her, even making plans to go to the beach in summer.
Park Hyeon-ik is taken into questioning where he refuses to disclose anything about Han-Mae, willing to take the fall himself. But he wavers when Ji-Sun falls at her feet and says she will do any thing and everything, begging him to return Da-eun to her. Another flashback takes us shortly after Jae-in had been discharged. He had given her the money which she then gave to her husband, as without his consent Jae-in couldn't be treated. We also see that he had indeed brought the money as soon as he could, running to her. But he was still late as he reached the hospital to find Han-Mae sitting outside with Jae-in in her arms, anger burning in her eyes. In the present, Hyeon-ik explains to Ji-sun that he didn't see her after that incident until a month ago when she asked him to kill her husband. When he hesitates, she offers Da-eun in exchange, saying that he could either ask for ransom or sell her off somewhere. But she had not held up her end of the deal and had run off with Da-Eun instead. Ji-sun vows to kill her if she touches a hair on Da-eun's body. Seeing her grieved, Hyeon-ik says that she had asked him to make a passport for her baby long ago, having had plans to go back to her country after earning some money. But now her baby's dead, so everyone joins the dots and assume she wants to flee with Da-eun.
The closest escape route seems to be a China bound ship for 1pm, and everyone heads there. Running into the boat when the officers are not looking, Ji-sun goes from room to room looking for the 2 when she spots them outside the window of a room. She runs to them but Han-Mae spots her before she can reach her and a chase ensues, resulting in the two women facing off on the hull. Han-Mae is in an illusion, thinking that Da-eun is Jae-in. She threatens to jump off when she sees herself surrounded by the police. Ji-sun tries to lure her with the patchwork quilt that Han-mae had made for Jae-in. She wavers after seeing the quilt. Ji-sun offers to jump off the ship herself as she apologises for the hospital incident, saying that Da-sun doesn't deserve to die and she wouldn't like to see her die either as she knows that Han-mae loves Da-eun as well. As she looks down at Da-eun, she sees Jae-in instead and finally realising that she is not her daughter, she hands Da-eun to Detective Park. Out of grief, Han-Mae jumps off the ship as Ji-sun throws herself after her to save her. She catches hold of her, but Han-Mae pulls her hand away from Ji-sun and she goes further and further down the deep sea, clutching Jae-in's quilt. As she goes down, she thinks back to the time she was pregnant with Jae-in and was telling her that she was going to make her the happiest baby in the world.
Ji-sun wakes up in her hospital bed, her first thought being Da-eun. The nurse brings her outside where she sees Da-eun playing with the other kids. Ji-sun kneels down and calls for Da-eun. She gets a bit depressed when Da-eun doesn't react to her at first, but then starts tearing up when she gets up and toddles towards Ji-sun, walking straight into her open arms and calling her ""Mama""."

The Villainess,"In the opening scene of the movie an unnamed highly skilled and trained assassin enters a hallway and kills numerous people with her gun and knives, not before being surrounded surrounded by cops and smiling a grim smile.
The assassin is shown in a room in an unnamed facility. She is drugged and is given plastic surgery. While recuperating she has a flashback showing an unnamed man with a mustache trying to resuscitate her after a breath holding exercise. He is calling her Sook-hee.
The facility turns out to be part of South Korea's intelligence agency and is run by a woman named Kwon-sook. Kwon-sook tells Sook-hee that to give her a new start the agency has faked her death. Kwon-sook tells her they have given her a new identity and name, Chae Yeon-soo. Yeon-soo says she doesn't care and wants to die. Kwon-sook tells Yeon-soo she is pregnant. Kwon-sook offers her a deal: train with her as an agent, work as an agent, and she will have freedom after 10 years of service. Yeon-soo accepts and while in training, gives birth to a daughter, Eun-hye.
Still at the facility, Yeon-soo is having a procedure to remove a tattoo from her shoulder and while this is happening, she has a flashback to the unnamed man with a mustache giving her the shoulder tattoo when she was 20-year-old Sook-hee. Another flashback occurs and we again see 20-year-old Sook-hee as a highly skilled and trained assassin trying to kill an unnamed man with yellow teeth. Sook-hee is captured and while beating her, the unnamed man with yellow teeth tells her he did not kill her father. Eventually, the unnamed man with a mustache arrives and shoots the unnamed man with yellow teeth and frees Sook-hee. The flashback continues and we see Sook-hee as an 8 year old being trained to load a pistol by the unnamed man with a mustache. The unnamed man with a mustache tells the young Sook-hee to devote her life as an assassin to him.
Kwon-sook gives Yeon-soo a folder with the info for her first ""assignment"". When she kills the target she looks up to see a young girl on the stairs. This triggers a flashback to 7-year-old Sook-hee seeing her father killed. Sook-hee is hiding under a bed and doesn't get a look at the killer's face, she only hears him whistling an eerie tune. When a man comes back into the room, we are shown that this person is Jang-Chun, the unnamed man with yellow teeth. Jang-Chun was a friend of Sook-hee's father. Her father had stolen a diamond. Jang-Chun sells Sook-hee to a prostitution ring. Sook-hee is about to be forcibly raped by a prostitution client when the unnamed man with a mustache arrives and rescues her. We learn his name is Lee Joong-sang. And we learn how it came about that Joong-sang trained Sook-hee to be this killing machine and why she is so devoted to him.
Having completed her first assignment, Yeon-soo is released from the facility and will continue to work for the agency from her own apartment that she shares with her daughter Eun-hye. Unknown to Yeon-soo, Kwon-sook has placed a male agent in the apartment beside Yeon-soo's apartment. His name is Jung-Hyun-soo and he is to befriend Yeon-soo and keep tabs on her.
After a few meetings with each other, Yeon-soo asks out Hyun-soo. While noticing Jung-Hyun-soo's tie, it reminds Yeon-soo of a tie she gave to Joong-sang. It is revealed in flashbacks that Sook-hee and Joong-sang had gotten married. We learn in a flashback that the marriage was not the same for Joong-sang as it was for Sook-hee. We learn that Sook-hee says that she is willing to let go of her thirst for revenge if she can get married and live a normal life. Joong-sang sees that his trained assassin would no longer be of much use, so he sets up an act. He stages a wedding with her and pays people to attend the wedding and while on their honeymoon, he fakes saving a gang member called Choi-Chun-Mo and stages his own death. When Sook-hee hears he is dead, she loses her mind and goes on a killing rampage and takes out the whole gang (who she thinks is behind Joong-sang's death). Joong-sang has eliminated his rivals and Joong-sang expects Sook-hee to be killed because of her rage and the sheer numbers of the gang. But they are no match. This is the opening scene of the movie.
While on a mission together with Min-ju, a classmate from the facility, Yeon-soo is caught stealing a phone, and in the ensuing fight, Min-ju is killed. The info from the phone has documents about Choi Chun-Mo and the agency is worried that since Yeon-soo knew him, she may be a double-agent. Hyun-soo comforts Yeon-soo and this brings them closer together.
Yeon-soo continues to live at the apartment and the agency has figured their next target for her. The agency wants to do an assassination from a wedding catering company so decides to arrange a wedding between Hyun-soo and Yeon-soo. In a callback to the earlier story the agency pays people to attend the wedding and Yeon-soo in her wedding gown aims a rifle out a window to her target, who she sees through the rifle scope is: Joong-sang. She can't kill him, shocked that he's still alive.
Joong-sang backtracks the location from which the shots come and identifies Yeon-soo as Sook-hee from the wedding photos. He makes contact with Yeon-soo to verify that it is actually her. He tapes a conversation of the agency and sends it to Yeon-soo. The conversation reveals that Hyun-soo is actually an undercover agent. She turns on the agency.
The agency takes Yeon-soo into custody. In the meanwhile, Joong-sang's gang gets to Hyun-soo and Eun-hye. Hyun-soo tries to tell Joong-sang (on the phone) that Eun-hye is, in fact, Joong-sang's daughter hoping for all the killing to stop. Joong-sang doesn't care for the little girl and tells Hyun-soo to kill the kid in exchange for his own life. Hyun-soo tries to fight the gang but is knocked unconscious and left with the little girl and a bomb.
Joong-sang stages a ""rescue"" of Yeon-soo from the agency's custody. As she reaches her apartment, she watches as the bomb goes off and Hyun-soo and her daughter both die. She thinks it's the work of the agency. She goes to confront Kwon-sook, but Kwon-sook has news for her. Hyun-soo had found Jang-Chun, the unnamed man with yellow teeth, and got to know everything. This interview was recorded on surveillance tape. Kwon-sook plays the tape for Yeon-soo.
Yeon-soo is consumed with revenge. Yeon-soo tracks down Joong-sang and his gang to a parking garage. She kills all the gang members in the garage and confronts Joong-sang, who escapes to the street and meets his remaining gang members and they speed off in a passenger bus. Yeon-soo chases after them. She catches up to the bus, boards the bus, crashes the bus and finally has an axe over Joong-sang's head, he puts his head down and starts whistling an eerie tune. She axes Joong-sang in the head before walking out of the wreckage with the police surrounding her, and smiles a grim smile."

Memoir of a Murderer,"Byeong-soo (Sol Kyung-gu) was a serial killer. He has secret memoir recounting his killings, stating he killed them because ""they deserved to die for their own atrocities."" His first victim was his father, who was abusing the rest of his family. He explains that he buried his victims in some bamboo woods. His last victim was an unknown woman, and as he was driving away, he got in a car accident and injured his head, resulting in Alzheimer's disease. He stopped killing after the accident.
Byeong-soo, now a veterinarian, lives with his teenage daughter Eun-hee (Kim Seol-hyun), who cares for him and records his activities in a tape recorder for him to remember them. The former serial killer goes to poetry class, where everyone praises his poems on the murders. However, when he threatens to kill them, they don't take him seriously. A woman, Jo Yeon-joo (Hwang Seok-jeong), from the class develops a crush on him, irritating him. He does his best to drive her away, but like the rest of the poetry group, she always thinks his threats are jokes from his poems. Byeong-soo is also unlikely friends with a policeman Byeong-man (Oh Dal-su).
There is a new series of killings and the doctor wonders if he has started killing again. The doctor has a rear ender accident with someone and there is unexplained blood at the scene. He sneaks some of it away as the other driver gets out. The driver says he hit a deer but Byeong-soo thinks he has found the psychopath killer. He follows the man and discovers a woman's body, and reports it to the police. Byeong-soo also gives the police a sample of blood. Despite his own findings that the blood was human blood, the police state that it was deer blood.
The man is revealed to be a local police man Tae-joo (Kim Nam-gil), who starts dating Eun-hee, meeting her while searching for Byeong-soo. He forbids her from seeing the young cop. To protect Eun-hee, he fights to keep his memory and he plans to kill Tae-joo. However it becomes apparent that his memories may not be as reliable as he expects them to be after attacking Eun-hee, mistaking her for the woman who was his last victim.
Byeong-soo's fears are apparently confirmed when he finds himself restrained to a wall, with Tae-joo hacking into his memoir. Byeong-soo attempts to reach his tape recorder to record Tae-joo's conversation, but apparently fails, barely managing to grab it and drops it. Tae-joo reveals he swapped the blood sample with deer blood, and threatens to kill Eun-hee unless Byeong-soo takes the blame for Tae-joo's crimes. Byeong-soo then wakes up, with no memory of what happened, and the entire incident is assumed to be a dream.
Byeong-soo orders Eun-hee to go with his sister Maria (Gil Hae-yeon) in a taxi and sends them off. Byeong-soo follows Tae-joo at night, and finds footage of Yeon-joo being held hostage. When he presents this evidence to the police, they suspect Byeong-soo himself is responsible. He later learns his memories have also made him delusional, as Maria had long before committed suicide, right after Byeong-soo killed their father. This proves he didn't send Eun-hee away with her aunt, and comes to think his daughter was killed by him instead. Byeong-soo gives up with his suspicions, and thinks he was actually responsible for Tae-joo's murders, especially when he remembers his annoyance and threats toward Yeon-jo. The police discover the bodies buried by Byeong-soo in the woods.
Byeong-soo remembers who his last victim was: his wife, whom he killed after discovering she was having an affair with another man. At this moment Byeong-soo learns that Eun-hee is not his biological daughter. After injuring his head in the car accident, he arrives home in a rage. Byeong-soo prepares to strangle a toddler Eun-hee, but his head injury causes his memory loss to kick in for the first time. When the pain goes away, he doesn't remember his wife's affair, instead comforting a frightened Eun-hee.
Back in the present and filled with guilt, Byeong-soo prepares to kill himself as he listens to the remaining recordings of Eun-hee on his tape recorder. However, he stops when another recording of Tae-joo confessing his crimes plays. Byeong-soo actually recorded Tae-joo's confession and threats to his daughter when he reached for the device. Byeong-soo realizes that he sent Eun-hee into a taxi with Tae-joo as the driver.
As Byeong-man prepares a search for Byeong-soo, he receives a call from the latter. Byeong-soo says that Tae-joo has his daughter, and plays the recording of Tae-joo's threats to the policeman, convincing him of the truth. The two work together to find Tae-joo, and Byeong-man follows him to a cabin in the woods. Byeong-man hides in the cabin and sees that Tae-joo has kidnapped Eun-hee, but Tae-joo kills the policeman as he prepares to apprehend him. As Byeong-soo arrives to the location, he records that he must save Eun-hee, and replaces her picture with Tae-joo's in a locket she gave to him to remember that he is a killer.
As Tae-joo is outside, Byeong-soo hides Eun-hee and Tae-joo attacks him. With his head injured again, Byeong-soo goes into a near-vegetative state, and he unwittingly leads Tae-joo to Eun-hee's hiding spot. As Tae-joo approaches Eun-hee, he reveals the truth of her father being a serial killer, and that he has to pay the price for his sins. Byeong-soo's memory restores and he manages to fight back before Tae-joo can kill her. Tae-joo appears to gain the upper hand, but Byeong-soo chokes him at the last minute and rolls on top of him, using the same technique he did to kill his previous victims. Tae-joo stabs him with a broken vase, but Byeong-soo persists. Finally giving up, the choking Tae-joo says that he himself will have to be punished. Byeong-soo takes the broken vase and stabs him to death. Eun-hee is now horrified by Byeong-soo, now knowing the truth about her father. However, he tells her that she is not the daughter of a murderer because of his wife's affair. Byeong-soo is later arrested. Eun-hee listens to Byeong-soo's latest recording about the need to find her and that she is the only reason why he is still alive. When she visits Byeong-soo, his Alzheimer's disease is at its worst, and he thinks he is a kid and Eun-hee is his dead sister.
In the final scene, Byeong-soo is released from prison, walking on a desolate railroad. When he looks at Tae-joo's picture which is still on his daughter's locket, his perceptions take a turn for the worst: his Alzheimer's disease kicks in again, and he records, ""Never trust your memory. Tae-joo is still alive,"" because many of his memories were unreliable before, he is suspicious of the memory of killing Tae-joo."
